Introduction by Ben Roberts, BFI CEO (Monday 17 May screening only).  

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film&#39;s ending  

A great 1970s movie that came out too late to be included in the canon, _Blow Out_ is a mind-blowing combination of conspiracy thriller and offbeat love story mixed with a reflection on the nature of cinema more engaging (and more profound) than the Antonioni film it references in its title. John Travolta gives one of his best performances as a movie soundman recording wind noises when he witnesses (and records) a fatal car crash. That sequence alone, with its extreme close-ups, rack-focus shots and depth of field, belongs in an anthology. Indeed, much of the pleasure in this most stylish of De Palma&#39;s films comes from Vilmos Zsigmond&#39;s cinematography and Paul Sylbert&#39;s production design, chopping the frame into vertical and horizontal grids and blocks of colour in even the most ordinary of interiors. Travolta&#39;s investigation takes him through a spectacularly grubby landscape of political corruption; the penultimate sequence, shot against Philadelphia&#39;s Fourth of July fireworks, is among the most florid of De Palma&#39;s visual flourishes; and the final scene is a killer.  
**Nick Roddick, _Sight &amp; Sound_, August 2007**  
  
It&#39;s easy to believe in De Palma&#39;s reported teenage fascination with technology: his meanings, in an individual film, are most often an extension of his technical means; and his body of work, up to _Blow Out_, has an unusually systematic progression, like a series of experiments. He treats both his own previous works and the works of others (especially Hitchcock&#39;s), as research to be built upon, suggestive hypotheses to be tested and then surpassed.
  
_Blow Out_ looks like a conscious summation of De Palma&#39;s themes and techniques. He draws his principal collaborators – actors John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow and Dennis Franz, cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, editor Paul Hirsch, composer Pino Donaggio – from his earlier films; lays out his full array of technical tricks – 360° pans, elaborate tracking shots, split screens, slow motion; deploys all his usual themes and visual motifs – surveillance, political and sexual paranoia, doomed love, the helpless observer, blood and breaking glass; places&#39; at its centre his autobiographical character, the technology whiz. He introduces the subject of filmmaking itself (and even includes a parody of his own work); takes another crack (after the failure of the too slavishly imitative _Obsession_) at capturing the dreamlike romantic horror of _Vertigo_. And he places it all in the narrative context of an assassination conspiracy plot that draws elements from the John Kennedy assassination, Ted Kennedy&#39;s Chappaquiddick scandal, the Watergate cover-up, and urban mass murderers such as New York&#39;s &#39;Son of Sam&#39; and San Francisco&#39;s &#39;Zebra&#39; killer, all the most powerful images of violence and corruption from the past 20 years of American history, and in the visual context of a scrupulously maintained colour scheme of red, white and blue. What De Palma was working toward all along, it seems, was this thrillerised autobiography of an American filmmaker.
  
The presence of an adult, rather than a teenager, at the centre of the film is the key to _Blow Out_&#39;s form and to its meaning. _Carrie_ and _The Fury_ were about people experiencing events with a first-time intensity, and were structured as series of shocks, progressions from innocence to cruel knowledge; the shocks are muted here, and deeper, and the structure is circular, because _Blow Out_&#39;s subject is the horror of repetition, the adult experience of having seen and heard it all before, events playing and replaying in our minds in an endless loop. The film means to have this effect on the viewer&#39;s memory, to send us circling back into the past at every point, both the past outside the film –_The Fury_ and _Dressed to Kill_, _Vertigo_ and _Blowup_, the Kennedy assassination and Watergate, even the revolutionary history of America (the action takes place in Philadelphia during an historical celebration called &#39;Liberty Day&#39;) – and the past within the film as well. _Blow Out_ ends where it began, in a screening room, and with the same piece of film, a shower murder from the trashy slasher movie _Coed Frenzy_; the sounds we hear in the film&#39;s key scenes – gun shots, footsteps, breaking glass, thunderous fireworks – are the same taped sounds that Jack Terry is collecting and labelling in the credit sequence; and Jack&#39;s pursuit of the killer of a presidential candidate ends in a re-enactment of the central trauma of his life, a botched surveillance operation that causes his confederate&#39;s death. Visually, the film is all circles: Jack&#39;s spinning reels of tape; the killer&#39;s garrotte.  
  
Jack Terry&#39;s story describes an arc from detachment to involvement and back again – back to something far beyond detachment, an anaesthetised professionalism. His art as a movie sound recordist allows him a certain distance: not only can he pick up sounds from far away, he picks them up dissociated from the images they will accompany on the screen. But when he hears, and records, the blow out that killed Governor McRyan, he begins to close the gap: by playing the tape again and again; by becoming involved with Sally, the other witness; and finally by attempting to put sound and image together. He makes a flip book out of a series of cut-out magazine photos of the crash, then animates the sequence, then synchronises his tape to the animation – all the while neglecting his work on _Coed Frenzy_ – and these scenes reach back, exhilaratingly, into the history of film: this jaded exploitation filmmaker is recovering an earlier, more vital self, rediscovering a reason for his art, reinventing a cinema of crude materials and passionate technique.  
  
In the end, when Terry&#39;s new-found joy in his technique has failed him and left Sally dead in his arms, he sits on a bench and listens to her last words on tape, then the tape spins on its reels in Jack&#39;s editing room when no one&#39;s there, as if it&#39;s circling on its own, and in the screening room her recorded scream is coming from the mouth of the girl shrinking from the looming knife in _Coed Frenzy_, De Palma&#39;s camera gliding around the figure of Jack watching and listening, saying &#39;good scream&#39; over and over as the film plays again, until he puts his hands to his head and covers his ears.  
  
It&#39;s a purely harrowing scene, De Palma&#39;s greatest shock, a confessional moment rendered with an objectivity that keeps us suspended between distance and identification. We know, as De Palma does, where this horror comes from, the despair that overtakes us as we watch ourselves, technicians, cut the deepest pain out of ourselves and turn it into product, into images of violence whose triviality is surreally disproportionate to their traumatic sources. What we don&#39;t know, as De Palma doesn&#39;t, is whether this communal replay of private nightmares, the American movie, is invigorating or numbing – or, like the drugs Tony Montana deals in _Scarface_ [1983], somehow both at once. De Palma&#39;s assumption of the identity of a Hollywood pro in _Scarface_ is his way of exploring the last implication of the sick joke at the end of _Blow Out_, plunging himself at last into the cold heart of the American screen.
