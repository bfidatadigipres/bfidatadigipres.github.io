Perhaps it's all the fault of the U.S. Army and Air Force, who banned _M\*A\*S\*H_ from their service theatres because it 'reflected unfavourably on the military,' that critical discussion of Robert Altman's hilarious, blasphemous black comedy has mostly centred on whether it is or is not an anti-war film.  

The question seems to me a monstrous red herring, first because the scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr has buried any message he may have had to offer beneath a ton of crude, abrasive, utterly convincing dialogue; secondly, because this empirical method implies an empirical message, and if there's one moral that can safely be drawn from the succession of gags and incidents which provide the film's sprawling narrative structure, it's that inflexible attitudes to war (chauvinistic, religious, bureaucratic or heroic) lead straight to the straitjacket.  

True, _M\*A\*S\*H_ (short for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) is set in a war, the Korean war to be precise, and its action takes place in a field hospital on the 38th Parallel. But only two shots are fired in the entire film (both from the referee's starting gun at an army football game), the enemy are neither seen nor mentioned, and the only direct reference to fighting comes when a veteran surgeon explains the absence of olives from the martini he offers a new arrival: 'We have to make certain concessions: we're only three miles from the front line.'  

But though the front is never seen and its proximity never exploited, the fighting there casts a crimson pall over the entire film: 'the valley of the shadow of death' which the manic major invokes in fervent prayer is a harsh reality. Behind the opening credits, twin helicopters – motionless, blood-drenched bodies strapped to their stretcher platforms – glide slowly over low hills, hovering lazily in the air before descending into the parched plain where the hospital is camped. Not shown again, they in one sense continue to hover, as body after body is conveyed from stretcher to operating table to ambulance or coffin, while beneath faulty lights and in an emergency theatre more crowded than the average maternity ward, the team of surgeons pass their 12-hour working day poking dispassionately around inside the guts, chests, brains of this endless succession of anonymous casualties, whose spare and sometimes vital parts pile up in refuse pails beside the blood-soaked swabs.  

Obviously much of the film's ironic tension derives from the contrast between the life-saving activity of the doctors and the destructive impulse of war. And this idea comes closer than most to being spelled out when two recalcitrant surgeons commandeer a Japanese military hospital to treat a local whore's baby: 'We stumbled on him. We didn't want him, but we couldn't back away from him.' But stronger though less explicit than the contrast between medicine and militarism is that between soldier and civilian. When a lady Major, horrified to find the doctors more interested in screwing than saluting her, remarks of the chief surgeon, 'I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a position of high responsibility in the Army Medical Corps,' the Chaplain tersely answers, 'He was drafted.' And one suspects the real source of official displeasure with the film is the way its enlisted characters obdurately persist in behaving like civilians. One Captain confuses lower ranks by habitually dressing as a private in fatigue clothes; a bearded doctor operates in a floral shirt, another in plus-fours and track shoes. No one salutes anyone, doctors and nurses devote all their extra-curricular energy to getting into one another's pants; the lady Major finds the Colonel bedded down with a sexy nurse when she storms in to complain of being exposed to public view in her shower; and everyone from the Colonel down is more interested in being demobilised than actually winning the war.  

If the puritan lady and the religious fanatic are victims of vicious practical jokes, they seem to invite these by their own hypocrisy. (Tumbling into bed together with a cry of 'His will be done!' they contrast sadly with the doctor who seduces a willing nurse on the officers' billiard table by mumbling 'Love has nothing to do with this. If my wife were here, I'd be with her.') Sex becomes a bawdy corollary of the fight for survival which the doctors embody. A fight in which moral rigidity and heroic rhetoric have no place, as the Chaplain is twice forced to recognise: when he abandons the last rites to hold a retractor in a tricky operation, or later when he joins in a parody of the Last Supper designed to deter the camp dentist from suicide.  

It's not just the rhetoric of Church and Army that receives the considerable weight of the script's satire, but also that of traditional war films. Throughout the proceedings an incompetent Tannoy (the most fully developed machine-character since the 2001 computer) announces such movies as _Halls of Montezuma_, whose inflated publicity blurbs stand in sharp counterpoint to the matter-of-fact realism which even shifts from irony to caricature cannot obscure: the amazing throwaway performances from the trio of surgeons, Yankee (Donald Sutherland), Jew (Elliott Gould) and Southerner (Tom Skerritt); the muted photography with its preponderant colours of camouflage-green and faded crimson (many of the gaudier scenes are shot through dirty windows) and marked preference for medium shots; the bedlam of the soundtrack, with overlapping dialogue and everybody talking at once.  

But beyond analytic observations, _M\*A\*S\*H_ demands to be taken, on its own empirical terms, as probably one of the most irreducibly funny films ever made.
