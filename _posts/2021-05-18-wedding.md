**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

All the ingredients needed for a traditional family wedding are present and correct in Robert Altman’s audacious social satire: class snobbery, racial prejudice, lechery, nymphomania, adultery, jilted envy, a whiff of incest, senility, alcoholism, drug addiction, and death. And it takes 48 principal characters to do justice to these and the many other taboos that Altman and his scriptwriting trio alight upon as southern blue blood Nina Van Pallandt and her Italian husband Vittorio Gassman welcome _nouveau riche_ Chicago trucking tycoon Paul Dooley and his brassy wife Carol Burnett for the wedding of their children, Desi Arnaz Jr and Amy Stryker.With more secrets and lies floating around than flakes of confetti, this is a cluttered compendium of sitcomedic and soap operatic clichés and caricatures spun into cinematic gold by a master of his craft. The odd subplot stalls, but the balance of savagery and poignancy is as perfect as Mia Farrow’s scene-stealing, two-word performance.

**‘A Wedding’: a contemporary review**

Up to a point, at least, Robert Altman’s celebration of the celebration of matrimony in _A Wedding_ is irresistibly and uncomplicatedly funny. Eavesdropping at precisely the right moment, his camera is invariably well placed to pull a plum out of the surrounding chaos of socially amplified intrigues, obsessions, eccentricities, gaffes, resentments and pretensions. Obviously doomed from the outset by a doddery old bishop who very nearly fails to unite the happy couple at all by forgetting the relevant lines; barely surviving the inconsiderately untimely demise of grandma (Lillian Gish), who lies a closely guarded secret on her death-bed upstairs; eliciting several rattling skeletons from the stately closets of the socially registered family who are busily marrying into _nouveau riche_ money; and reaching a nadir of screeching recrimination when bride and groom are believed (erroneously) to have been killed shortly after taking off in their honeymoon car – the wedding gradually becomes a looking-glass into which one peers, fascinated, at a minor key counterpart to the nine circles of Dante’s inferno.

With Altman’s actors as usual given their carefully controlled heads, his little set pieces are singularly easy to take. For instance, the illicit encounter in the kitchen garden between the mother of the bride (Carol Burnett) and the corpulently jovial uncle of the groom (Pat McCormick) who has pleaded sudden passion with such eloquence that she bemusedly yields. Rushing ecstatically into each other’s arms, under the curious gaze of a bevy of pageboys and flower-girls, they merely contrive to judge angle and distance insufficiently well to fulfil E. M. Forster’s maxim of ‘Only connect...’ Or again, even more sitcom in effect – but none the less engaging for that – the lemming-like rush for too few lavatories after the lengthy ceremony, which leaves the tottering bishop (John Cromwell), kindly guided to the brink of bliss in an anteroom, despairingly contemplating the infinity of mirrors behind one of which is the desired door.

Paradoxically, however, one also gradually becomes aware of the extent to which Altman is making his audience work for their easy laughs by leaving characters unintroduced, relationships unstated, undercurrents unstressed. At the very end of the film, for example, after all the horrors have been tidily tucked away under the carpet and a semblance of harmony restored, the professional wedding organiser (Geraldine Chaplin) and one of the bridesmaids (Lesley Rogers) sit gratefully on the front steps of the house to relax for a moment in the approaching darkness. Weddings, sighs Geraldine Chaplin, are so lovely, so sad when they end. ‘Yeah,’ murmurs Lesley Rogers, ‘when it’s over it gets real sad.’ Given the travesty of loveliness we have just witnessed, the irony is obvious (all the more so in that the Chaplin character has been revealed as a lesbian). But the scene only acquires its full reverberation if one has also picked up en route the casual intimation that the gentleman glimpsed furtively screwing in the bushes earlier on was Lesley Rogers’ husband, so that one begins to wonder whether her ‘when it’s over’ referred not only to a wedding but to a marriage.

At the same time one realises, as the film progresses, that the ‘naturalism’ (comically heightened, of course) is gradually being abandoned for – in the phrase annexed by Jonathan Rosenbaum in defence of _Nashville_ – a ‘dialectic collage of unreality’. No one wedding could credibly throw out quite so many sins and situations as this one does. Yet Altman keeps on turning the screw, ever more outrageously, until the bones and ligaments of reality snap and, as in _Nashville_, one finds oneself confronted by an almost abstract microcosm which can be interpreted any way one wants.

Quite apart from its obvious symbolic connotations (religious, social, dynastic, hierarchic, authoritarian), a wedding would seem peculiarly apt to Altman’s purpose since it is above all a solemn occasion upon which people are careful to be on their best behaviour in defence of all their little deceits and lapses, and also a joyous celebration in which tongues and manners are likely to be loosened enough to let the guard drop. Radiating outwards from the fact of the old grandmother lying upstairs in unacknowledged death as the wedding reception proceeds, a whole system of such defences is revealed. Two salient facts in particular emerge. One is that the materfamilias has fondly indulged one of her daughters (Virginia Vestoff) in an affair with a black manservant (Cedric Scott), always provided it is conducted exclusively within her four walls. The other is that she has equally complaisantly ensured the perpetuation of her dynasty. Her daughter, the mother of the groom (Nina Van Pallandt) has married an Italian (Vittorio Gassman) generally and indulgently supposed to have some romantic relation to the Mafia, but in fact a humble waiter solemnly sworn by grandma never to reveal his shameful origins.

As in _Nashville_, the socio-political caps left lying around fit very comfortably indeed, with even the wedding guests who fail to show up suggesting the bankruptcy of America’s policy of goodwill. The trouble is that, whereas the characters in _Nashville_ obstinately maintained lives and wills of their own, often running counter to the allegory and destroying its linear simplicity, here they exist only within, and in terms of, the wedding. _A Wedding_, in other words, is much more simplistic: good fun, but not, like _Nashville_, a kaleidoscopic reappraisal of the American dream.
