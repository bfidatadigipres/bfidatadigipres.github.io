**SPOILER WARNING The following notes give away some of the plot.**

Released in 1971 amidst the dope-fuelled rush of the New Hollywood, Peter Bogdanovich’s second feature _The Last Picture Show_ was in many ways an out-of-time anomaly. With its black-and-white photography, gentle pace, period setting and formal classicism, it was closer to the work of critic and film historian Bogdanovich’s mentors John Ford and Howard Hawks than it was to that of his New Wave-inspired peers at the BBS production company. But it was immediately embraced as a modern classic – _Newsweek_ wrote that it was ‘the most important work by a young American director since _Citizen_ _Kane_’ – propelling Bogdanovich at a stroke into the front rank of US filmmakers.

Adapted from a novel by Larry McMurtry, the film takes place in a small Texas town over the course of a year (from October 1951 to October 1952), following the relationships and entanglements of its inhabitants, both school kids on the cusp of graduation – played by then newcomers Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Randy Quaid and Timothy Bottoms – and their elders, played by Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan.

The film is an elegy at once for a period in history, for a time in one’s life, for small-town America – and for the kind of studio-produced cinema that Bogdanovich loved, but that was ironically being supplanted by the energies of his peers.

The Last Picture Show _was made for Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider’s legendary BBS, who were the vanguard of the New Hollywood at the start of the 1970s. Did you feel part of that movement?_

You’re never fully aware you’re part of something when you’re in the middle of it, but I did dimly recognise that we were moving into a new era.  

What happened was that Henry Jaglom was friendly with Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson, because he’d helped them edit _Easy Rider_. Henry saw [Bogdanovich’s 1967 debut] _Targets_, and brought it to the attention of Bert and Bob. They liked it very much, and said to me that if there was anything I wanted to make, I should bring it to them.

Later on I was told that Bob and Bert had a bit of a disagreement about doing the picture with me after they had dinner with me and my wife at the time, Polly Platt, because we were not into grass or cocaine or anything. Bert said to Bob, ‘They’re so square. Are you sure we should do the picture?’ Bob said, ‘Look, we’ve got enough crazies around. We should do it.’ They encouraged me to add bad language and all of that, and I somewhat reluctantly embraced that – if I was going to do this story about teenage lust and love, we’d better tell it honestly. Most of the sex in the picture is really funny rather than erotic – as teenage love often is.

_In other respects the film is very classical, looking back to an older American style of filmmaking – in contrast to other BBS films, which borrowed from the European New Wave._

I grew up with the classic American cinema. I didn’t like all that jiggling camera, jump cuts, zoom lenses – I felt it took the audience out of the picture. But it wasn’t a crusade of any kind. One of the things that makes _Picture Show_ intriguing is the tension between the material and the execution. The material is very frank and candid, unlike the classic American cinema, which was more oblique. Certainly the [Production] Code would have prevented the kind of stuff we were doing.

_For all its 1950s setting, much of the film plays like a western. Did that arise naturally because you were a fan of westerns yourself?_

I guess it must have had some western reverberations with me, but I wasn’t thinking of it that way. I did think of it in the sense of what the West had become, and what had gone – so at the end I used the clip from _Red River_, where there’s adventure, a frontier to be broken. All that was over and passed, and they’re living in this end-of-nowhere place.

_Other cinephile directors – Scorsese, for instance – very openly borrow particular shots from their influences. Is this something you did on_ The Last Picture Show _?_

Not really. But I learned the technique and craft of making movies from watching classic American cinema. Hitchcock once said to me: ‘Never use an establishing shot to establish. Why? Because it has no dramatic meaning. Only use it when it has dramatic meaning in the story.’

I took that advice on _Picture Show_ – for example in Sam’s funeral scene. It’s all played in very close shots – until the last shot, when Ellen Burstyn’s character walks away, and we drop back and show what would normally be an establishing shot, with the great open sky above them. It has much more power at that point because you’re invested emotionally.

_Apparently Bert Schneider was alarmed when he saw you hadn’t shot establishing shots, and were cutting ‘in camera’?_

Well, from watching the masters [at work], I saw that they only shot what they needed – they didn’t shoot additional scenes and coverage and so on. I once watched Ford put his hand over the lens and say, ‘That’s enough of that.’

_You discovered Cybill Shepherd after seeing her photo on the cover of a magazine. What convinced you she would work on screen?_

It was a look on her face. She was wearing this shirt which had little ‘I love yous’ written all over it, but the look on the face belied the sentiment on the shirt – it was more ‘Well, maybe I’d love you.’

Then when I met her, I remember a gesture she did. We were in a hotel room and she was sitting on the floor, and there was a breakfast tray on the coffee table next to where she was sitting. There was a little vase with a single rose in it, and as we were talking she started flicking the rose around with her finger, very casually. I thought: ‘That’s the way she treats guys.’ That gesture, small as it was, convinced me that she had this kind of offhand delivery that would work with the picture.

_Do you think_ The Last Picture Show _has had a lasting influence?_

I don’t know. I saw Jeff Bridges recently and we talked about _Picture Show_, and Jeff said, ‘It’s funny, it sort of stands by itself. There’s not a picture like it.’ The actors, of course, all became well known. I remember seeing Emir Kusturica’s _Do You Remember Dolly Bell?_ at the Venice Film Festival in 1981, when I was on the jury. I thought it looked familiar to me, and I then found out that he’d been very influenced by _Picture Show_. We gave him an award!

_Has it ever felt like a millstone?_

No, I’m very proud of it. It’s the film of mine that people return to. Orson Welles and I were talking about Greta Garbo one time, and he was raving about her transcendent quality, and me being pedantic said, ‘Yes, but isn’t it too bad that there are only two great films?’ – thinking of _Ninotchka_ and _Camille_. He looked at me for a minute and said, ‘Peter, you only need one.’ I have my one.<br>
