_+ Pre-recorded intro and Q&A with Pedro Almodóvar and Tilda Swinton_

Madness and melancholy intersect to thrilling effect as Almodóvar reimagines Jean Cocteau’s short play _The Human Voice_ for an era in which isolation has become a way of life. Laws of desire become the rules of the game as Tilda Swinton’s unnamed woman paces and panics in a glorious Technicolor apartment where décor offers a window into her state of mind. A short, sharp shot of distilled Almodóvar: passion, emotion, heartbreak, wit, and melodrama exquisitely bound up in a tale for our times.<br>

Like machinery driving a dramatic artefact of clockwork precision, wrenches, bolts and tools of all shapes and sizes slide onto the screen for the credits of Pedro Almodóvar’s latest creation, a half-hour free adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s play _The Human Voice_ starring Tilda Swinton.

Right from the start, this _Human Voice_ strikes familiar chords with Almodóvar’s work: its vibrant colour palette; Alberto Iglesias’s music; a cameo from producer brother Agustín Almodóvar; even those credits, composed from items fit for an haute-couture hardware catalogue. Then there’s the protagonist: a heartbroken woman caged in a red dress. We find Swinton’s character on an empty sound stage, contemplating the void that her absent lover has left.

Almodóvar had already used _The Human Voice_ (famously adapted by Roberto Rossellini in his 1948 anthology film _L’amore_, starring Anna Magnani) as a source of inspiration for earlier films like _Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown_ (1988), with Carmen Maura playing an abandoned woman – a role echoing the one she had previously played in a stage version of Cocteau’s play that featured in _The Law of Desire_ (1987).

In Almodóvar’s new take on the play, Tilda Swinton actually speaks the phrase ‘the law of desire’ – which fans will also recognise as inspiring the name of the director’s production company El Deseo. In the new film, Swinton’s character inhabits an apartment revealed as a film set – the fourth wall, and indeed the ceiling, removed in an overhead shot.

Her props: DVDs including Douglas Sirk’s _Written on the Wind_ and _All That Heaven Allows_ (one of Almodóvar’s classic references), books by authors including Lucia Berlin and Alice Munro (who inspired his 2016 film _Julieta_), a handful of sleeping pills, an axe to chop the empty suit of her lover, and Air Pods for the last phone conversation with the man who left her behind. She paces, as trapped and lost as the dog that follows her about, the animal seemingly as distraught as she at the loss of this invisible man whom we never hear.

It’s Swinton’s voice that reigns in this perfectly tailored space, carved with the delicacy of a Fabergé egg – her human imperfection filling the stage with life, not its imitation. Swinton offers a magnificent, fine-tuned performance as a melodrama heroine ready to take her grief in hand, triumphant in her desolation, finally ready to move on and rise – and not just metaphorically – like a phoenix from the ashes of her lost passion.

As much as it is Almodóvar’s filmography in a nutshell, _The Human Voice_ is also a promise of new beginnings, exploring the short format and shooting in English (his upcoming projects even include plans for a western). Maybe that’s why, at the film’s end, he frames the open door of the film set, letting us, and his heroine, out onto a wide world of new possibility.<br>
