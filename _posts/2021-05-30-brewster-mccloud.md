_Brewster McCloud_ registers as an honourable failure: a species of crazed doodling with all the awkward, endearing earmarks of a promising ‘first’ film, in which a director tries to do and say everything at once, trusting to find his coherence in the cutting room. Wildly overlapping allegory, satire, TV burlesque, social protest, demented bird lectures and conventionally dull songs by John Phillips, the film nurtures a dream of ‘escape by flight’ from convention that is as innocently vague as its hero’s, and as predictably doomed. But along the way are some glancing pleasures that suggest some of the achievements to come: the intercut and overlapping use of René Auberjonois’ bird lecture in relation to the already fragmented plot, at least until this relationship becomes overly rigid and predictable; the debut of Shelley Duvall, an Altman discovery, as a Texas-grown variant of _Breathless_’ Patricia; the bold delivery of certain oddball gags – like the instant splattering of a newspaper headline (‘AGNEW: SOCIETY SHOULD DISCARD SOME U.S. PEOPLE’) by a bird dropping, or the appearance of a tough hard-leather delinquent sporting a Porky Pig T-shirt – along with some looser forms of humour, such as John Schuck’s likeable enactment of a conscientious, semi-retarded Houston cop.

It is only after the exorcism of _Brewster_, in _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_, that Altman arrives at a fluent and developed style which can support his semi-improvised approach. Henceforth, even his ‘mistakes’, like _Images_ – an old Altman project predating _MASH_ that was filmed after _McCabe_ – will carry a technical proficiency and assurance that can support many calculated risks.

The 'open spaces' that Altman offers to his fellow craftsmen or creates for himself are obviously not identical to the ones that his films offer to audiences, but they are related none the less: the openness and variability of a film’s conception can help to encourage an open and variable response.

Broadly speaking, shooting, editing and sound-mixing appear to be regarded by Altman as a process of elucidation, elaboration and discovery as much as one of execution. (‘The script will indicate character and situation,’ he has remarked, ‘what I do comes on top of that.’) Actors are occasionally employed without written parts, invited to ‘fall in with the material’ and create their own roles, or encouraged to alter or expand their scripted parts during rehearsals. Rather than scout every location in advance, Altman sometimes chooses to encounter them only when he arrives with his camera crew.

Equally significant are the ‘open spaces’ that Altman allows for during shooting and then fills at the editing or sound-mixing stage. The various announcements over the public address system in _MASH_, René Auberjonois’ bird lecture in _Brewster_ and Leonard Cohen’s songs in _McCabe_ were all arrived at and introduced long after shooting began; and one might deduce that the use of Susannah York’s children’s book (_In Search of Unicorns_) in _Images_, the title tune in _The Long Goodbye_, the radio shows in _Thieves like Us_ and Phyllis Shotwell’s songs in _California Split_ were all partially determined after shooting was over. (_Only_ partially, one assumes, because all four of these ‘independent’ elements figure briefly within the actions of their respective films.)  
**Jonathan Rosenbaum, _Sight and Sound_, Spring 1975**

To put it a little ponderously, much of the humour of Robert Altman’s _MASH_ derived from the fact that it consistently went against the grain of the conventional war film – not so much unconventional as anti-conventional; at the same time, the surreal presentation of the wilder antics at the Army hospital carried conviction because of the recognisable reality of each of the characters involved (even the surgery was accurate!).

_Brewster McCloud_ has all of the surface anarchy of _MASH_ (fragmented narration; a large number of ‘characters’, often talking over one another’s best lines; a wealth of exhilarating detail, frequently to be found on the peripheries of the frame) but without that film’s recognisable hard centre. This time, Altman attempts to graft some telling social satire on to a central character who hovers uncertainly between significant metaphor and free-wheeling fantasy – an Icarus child with horn-rimmed spectacles, endeavouring to fly above the corrupt materialism of the human condition. Part of the trouble is that Altman is rather more skilful at capturing the corruption than at dignifying man’s attempts to escape it, and his wide-eyed hero, in the end literally, somehow falls flat on  his face.

The screenplay (by Doran William Cannon, and not entirely free from the determination to be fashionably zany that characterised his script for _Skidoo_) seems anxious to emphasise that the film’s central fantasy is rich in contemporary meanings; and to underscore the point, an impassioned lecture from an ornithologist is cut into the film at significant moments in the action. The lecturer is played by René Auberjonois (the restrained chaplain from _MASH_) in a marvellous creased-clothes, soot-covered, sweat-streaked portrait of empathetic scholarship: flapping his shoulder blades and puffing up his chest, growing more and more like a bird as the film progresses.

The conception may be dubious, but the characterisation is impeccable – and this holds true for so many elements in the film: Michael Murphy (another _MASH_ veteran) as the blue-eyed boy of the West Coast Force, with a suitcase full of cashmere sweaters and specialising in unruffable calm, shooting himself when an accident reveals that at least one of his eyes is brown; Stacy Keach as the churlish miser, reaching for his gun when his helpful chauffeur tries to pick up the money he has dropped; William Windom as the soft-spoken politician with a smooth phrase for every journalist and a predilection for ‘working’ in his bath; or the pimply child calmly snapping his sadistic daddy’s corpse with his Polaroid, while the bruised widow beams approval. Visually, and not a little ironically, the most successful surrealism derives from the use of the real Houston Astrodome (a glass and concrete answer to Dante’s purgatory). Apparently, in the version of the script submitted to MGM, the film was to be set in New York. But Altman, as in _MASH_, shows a keen ear for Southern comfort, and one of his happiest inventions is the voice on the police car radio, transmitting details of the suspect’s whereabouts and signing off with a cheery ‘Proceed with caution, you-all.’
