Not uncharacteristically of Altman, _A Perfect Couple_ grew out of the jetsam of his professional life: in this case, a desire to further explore Paul Dooley and Marta Heflin (who had played small parts in _A Wedding_), and to extend his collaboration with Allan Nicholls (a songwriter who had co-scripted _A Wedding_, but who was also the creator of the pop group Keepin' 'Em off the Streets which was revived to play a focal role here). Also not uncharacteristically, these elements are mixed into a popular formula which Altman then, as in _A Wedding_ and _Quintet_, proceeds to complicate if not actually to subvert. To all intents and purposes, therefore, _A Perfect Couple_ is a remake of _Marty_, with the pair of lonely hearts kept isolated not by their physical unattractiveness so much as by their irreconcilable backgrounds, and winning through to a kind of loving by way of a series of heart-warming and doggily funny mishaps.

More interesting (and more the real subject of the film) is the formal expression Altman gives to these backgrounds. Like Papa Theodopoulos, who regiments his family in every detail of their public and private lives, Teddy (the leader of Keepin’ ‘Em off the Streets) maintains strict discipline, imposing fines and refusing to allow defections from rehearsals, always insisting that the group – like the Theodopoulos family – must be a unit. Teddy, however, is concerned with the harmonies produced by his unit, while Papa Theodopoulos insists only that the right notes be struck. Free to behave as they will off-stage, the members of Keepin’ ‘Em off the Streets are accorded the same liberty on stage, provided they attune to the desired harmony (one singer, for instance, turns aside to nurse or play with her baby when not required at the microphone); and the camera movements recording both rehearsals and performances are imbued with a sense of warm, sinuous grace. By contrast, the Theodopoulos family, forbidden any deviation, are always on stage, drilled into movements as mechanical as a chorus line as they troop Indian file into the dining room, or along the corridors of the family antique emporium in the wake of their patriarch; and the sense of the camera here is sharp, edgy, stilted.

The difficulty is that the strategy reduces the Greek family to little more than puppets, so that Altman’s critical comparison between two worlds goes for very little. But given the exquisitely classical simplicity with which the pop numbers are staged (against a cyclorama with projected moon, and gaunt metallic tree as sole prop), the happy ending which engineers a cosy alliance between Keepin’ ‘Em off the Streets and the Los Angeles Philharmonic is more than a mere pirouette. Without necessarily making musical comparisons, Altman has evoked a vitality in pop and a validity in audience reactions to it which comment adversely on the formally reverential hush with which Papa Theodopoulos requires his family to pay homage to classical pops, and which suggest that both cultures can learn profitably from each other.  
**Tom Milne, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, November 1979**

_A Perfect Couple_ is based on a cultural opposition which turns out to be curiously affectless, a mechanism for generating the comedy that has little resonance in itself. Alex Theodopoulos (Paul Dooley), the eldest son of an old-world Greek family that maintains strict patriarchal decorum in present-day  Los Angeles, their lives devoted to classical music and a large antique emporium, meets Sheila Shea (Marta Heflin), a singer with the pop group ‘Keepin’ ‘Em off the Streets’, through an audio-visual dating agency, Great Expectations. Their romance, diffident on her part, earnestly companionable on his, is hindered by the similar demands of their very different worlds: much time is spent establishing how they are both dominated by rituals and schedules.

The first thing to note about this confection is that its Altmanesque features are more illusory than real. The conception of the film seems to have been a typically wayward process, born of Altman’s desire to pair Dooley and Heflin (whom he had liked in small parts in _A Wedding_) and his collaboration with Allan Nicholls, songwriter and music impresario (Altman actor in _Nashville_, _Buffalo Bill_ and co-writer of _A Wedding_), and creator of Keepin’ ‘Em off the Streets a year or so before their reconstitution for _A Perfect Couple_. Rather like the ‘real’ political campaign that was set rolling in _Nashville_, Altman launched the group with all the trappings of an actual press party, which then became a scene in the film; and like the musical accompaniment to _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_, Nicholls’ original songs for the group pre-dated the film, but were seen to have an integral relationship to its story. But if such circumstances suggest the ideal setting for a typically Altman set of interactions, it is a surprise to discover that _A Perfect Couple_ is bound more by plot – though of an ironic, light-hearted, almost Lubitschian kind. The course of true love is principally smoothed by another couple, who dance peripherally and (until the very end) quite blissfully through the film, dropping connections that once or twice cause the main characters to exclaim ‘Kismet’. Even the humour is less chaotic à la _Nashville_ or _Buffalo Bill_, and more deliberately inconsequential, à Ia _MASH_.

Such qualities may make the film sound, in the context of Altman’s work, sadly retrogressive. But to an extent, they supply it with an honest basis in sentiment and generic convention, and shore it against the bad faith of something like  _A Wedding_, which pretends to a sophistication beyond its capricious narrative that it can never really bring itself to define. What, however, is disheartening about _A Perfect Couple_ is that the various kinds of ‘performance’ it juxtaposes – classical and pop music; old-world formality and contemporary indeterminacy (both social and sexual) – never become significant tensions, as they do, say, in the anxieties of Buffalo Bill, Essex’s baffled quest [in _Quintet_], and even (in more abstract terms) the changes in coloration of the three women [from _3 Women_]. Since he detached himself from Hollywood’s established forms and meanings, Altman has consistently worried over how his fictional performances might be weighed against ‘reality’. It is an odd and inevitably naive preoccupation, but one which is central to the way Altman sees his work as a many-handed enterprise whose aim is to reproduce the ambiguity of each spectator’s experience. In the least of his films (_Nashville_,  _A Wedding_), he hopefully resolves the problem by blurring the distinction between the two; in the more rigorous (_Buffalo Bill_, _3 Women_, _Quintet_), squaring the world with men’s fictions looks more of a Sisyphean task. In this sequence, _A Perfect Couple_ is a curious dead spot, which raises the problem in a way that allows Altman to close most of his mind to it, and so effect the facile harmony of the closing musical number.
