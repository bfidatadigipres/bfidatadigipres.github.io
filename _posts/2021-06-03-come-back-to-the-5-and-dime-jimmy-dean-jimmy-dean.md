The director of _Nashville_, _A Wedding_, _The Perfect Couple_ is dead. Long live the director of _3 Women_, _Quintet_ – and _Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean_. Well, not exactly... In the steady to and fro that has become the pattern of his work in recent years, Robert Altman is about to move from the becalmed, interior-motivated spaces of _5 & Dime_ back into the scampering, other-directed territory of _Nashville_ – an area where he has undoubtedly found most of his critical kudos. The only connection between _5 & Dime_ and his new film, _OC & Stiggs_, is that they both take place in desert climes. Altman is currently in Arizona, shooting a script by two of the editors of the _National_ _Lampoon_ (was the director of _MASH_ destined to pass through the precincts of _Animal_ _House_?), concerning two youngsters who, in Altman’s words, ‘decide that they shouldn’t listen to anything their parents or teachers tell them, because they might grow up to be like them.’ The eponymous heroes are played by two unknowns, but the older generation is represented by the likes of Ray Walston, Paul Dooley, Jane Curtain, Tina Louise – and Dennis Hopper (‘he’ll be playing the character he played in _Apocalypse_ _Now_’). Apart from that, the game at stake will be one of those open-ended affairs in which Altman always seems at his most accessible while remaining most elusive. ‘We're dealing with what we find here, rather than what we have created.’

Since _5 & Dime_, in fact, Altman has already shot another film, _Streamers_, again based on a play (by David Rabe), and again an echt theatrical microcosm (an army barrack room, rife with sexual, racial and generational conflict). Once more, Altman seems to have made a point of preserving the unreal claustrophobia on film. ‘I didn’t open it up. It’s all in one set, and I never let the camera out of the barracks.’ More than that, he would seem to have found a second life as a film director through the theatre. In 1981, after _Popeye_ – for all its comic strip/folk hero appeal, one of the hermetically sealed/community apart Altmans – he sold his Lion’s Gate studio in Los Angeles and moved to New York to form Sandcastle 5 productions. Since then, he has been strictly a stager and transcriber of theatre, first presenting two one-act plays by Frank South (_Precious_ _Blood_ and _Rattlesnake in a Cooler_) then Ed Graczyk’s _5 & Dime_, before taping all three for cable television (_5 & Dime_ was shot for $800,000 on Super-16mm equipment that would also allow theatrical 35mm prints to be struck).

Richard Corliss’ account of the stage and tape versions of the three plays in _Film_ _Comment_ (January/February, 1983) tantalisingly suggests how central they may be to an Altman whose forte is dealing with multiple characters within a minimal cast, and not in a more literal one-to-one relationship. The fact that Corliss finds the plays so difficult to accommodate (‘Those who look for the more obvious Altman trademarks in either the stage or the cable versions of these plays will be disappointed’) may have a lot to do with the conventional wisdom about Altman that is applied (‘[his] characteristic films were big parties; everyone was promised a fair hearing, though not all could be clearly heard’). But description alone of _Rattlesnake in a Cooler_, ‘the sidewinding autobiography of a down-and-out Kentucky physician (Leo Burmester) whose itch to hit the road west mixed him up with some bad company,’ suggests that there are more ways than one to stage a big party. ‘Burmester – a chunky, runty guy with the ricochet moves of an ageing wide receiver and more character voices than Mel Blanc’s put together – makes South’s menagerie of rednecks come alive ...’

The two South plays were staged first for the Los Angeles Actors’ Theatre and then at Saint Clements Church in Manhattan; _Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean_ was Altman’s first Broadway production.  He describes the urge to put the latter on film very much in terms of the theatrical experience. ‘I was standing backstage one night watching the play and realised there were things on those actresses’ faces which the audience couldn’t see.’ The possible connections with his other films, with _3 Women_, for instance? ‘It’s something I saw afterwards; I didn’t see it while I was doing it. But the play was never meant to be realistic, there was a strong suggestion that this place wasn’t even there, that it existed only in their minds and in our minds. It has to do with living your life through somebody else’s life – what happens when the circus comes to town and then leaves?’ On the subject of truth and illusion, fame and its shadow, Altman claims no special interest in James Dean himself (about whom he made a documentary in 1957). ‘In fact, when I first saw the title of the play, I nearly sent it back.’ Interestingly, in terms of the reputation of the _Nashville_ films as roadshows of the real, Altman refers disparagingly to that solitary essay in biography as a ‘pseudo-documentary’.

Permutations of the real and the unreal, of lives and half-lives, circulate round the actual staging of _5 & Dime_ – and the technique for splitting its action into two complementary time zones. In the theatre, to establish the division of the stage between 1955 and 1975, ‘we created the illusion of a mirrored wall and used doubles at the beginning of the play.’ On film, the illusions were all real: a two-way mirror divided a set of the five and dime in 1975 from a second, reversed set for 1955. Shifts from one to the other were accomplished with computer-controlled lighting. ‘We had no opticals in the film at all, it was all done mechanically.’ Critical reception of both play and film conjures another set of reflections. Altman describes the play as an out-of-town success that took a critical drubbing on Broadway (prompting, it seems, something of a falling out with playwright Graczyk), which was then picked up in New York reviews of the film. Two champions of the latter, however, have inexplicably referred it back to that Other Altman: according to _Variety_, it is ‘the filmmaker’s most accessible and enjoyable film since _Nashville_’; and to Pauline Kael, ‘his touch seems as sure here as it was wobbly in most of the pictures he has made since _Nashville_.’
