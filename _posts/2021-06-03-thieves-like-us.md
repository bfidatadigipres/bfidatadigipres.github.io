_The 35mm print of this film is sadly now too colour faded to present so  we will be screening this film from a video format. We apologise for any disappointment._

At the beginning of his 1949 adaptation of Edward Anderson’s _Thieves like Us_, Nicholas Ray isolated his two star-crossed young lovers in a glowing portrait-prologue, and characterised their tragedy as that of two people who had never been properly introduced to the world.

In an almost perverse antithesis (although the director has reputedly never seen _They Live by Night_), Robert Altman’s version opens with one long, leisurely landscape shot that reduces characters to remotely gesticulating stick figures, and suggests how much of a tightly circular route their brief careers will follow. A railroad handcar, carrying a work party of convicts, appears in the distance; the camera follows it for a while across the lush Mississippi countryside, then passes on to pick up two escaped convicts fishing on a lake; amidst some inane, half-heard conversation about the advantages of fishing in the rain, they drag their boat to shore and climb a hill to wait for a third accomplice, just as the second piece of transport enters the picture – a prison van about to be hijacked by the escapees.

From the start, a predetermined doom hangs over both films, but where Ray follows closely, ecstatically and finally despairingly down the road taken by his couple, Altman draws back to watch tragi-comic figures flit through an absurd landscape. In fact, the one evidently weak spot of _Thieves like Us_ is an extended sequence in which Altman tries hardest to be romantically at one with his young lovers while maintaining the ironic commentary of an observer who sees the traps ahead. As Bowie and Keechie make love for the first time – their hesitant approaches and timid discoveries dissolving together in a series of brief scenes so that time seems suspended over their happiest interlude – a radio broadcast of _Romeo and Juliet_ is heard in the background, with a salient description of the pair falling in love at their first interview repeated twice in a curious refrain. The result is a sentimental cynicism, which Altman elsewhere excludes from his perspective: Ray’s lovers have the innocence of juvenile runaways about to be slapped down by parental authority; Altman’s might simply be playing like children or puppies, and their games are inevitably encroached upon by the necessities of a harder world.

In method and viewpoint (and also in terms of near-perfect achievement) _Thieves_ seems closest to the excellent _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_, Altman’s previous foray into history and myth in which doomed romanticism and comedy of the absurd are equally at work. The phrase ‘Thieves like us’ is as crucial here as it was for Anderson and Ray – the latter was prevented from using it as his title – indicating the awareness of this trio of small-time desperadoes that they are only doing what the sharks of private enterprise are doing in socially sanctioned ways. But its meaning is shaded by the emphasis given another reiterated thought: ‘There’s never been three like us’, wishfully asserted by the elder of the group, T-Dub.

The boyish dream of being three against the world, of living up to the comic-strip and radio-serial heroes of childhood, is the comic motif of their careers; their withdrawal from deprivation into this particular kind of infantilism is as complete as the retreat of the miners in _McCabe_ from their harsh environment to the reassuring warmth of bar-rooms, card-tables and McCabe’s stoking of a specious reputation – the theme schematised by Altman into a pointed contrast between the landscapes within and without.

Here the theme is deployed more casually, but no less atmospherically, through the long sequence in which the gang goes to ground at the home of  T-Dub’s sister-in-law Mattie. Time palpably hangs heavy as the activities of Mattie’s two children assume as much importance as those of the forlorn thieves: the little boy patiently tinkers with matches and fireworks, the girl apes her elders through a practice tap-dance; a dinner-table scene is a confusing colloquy of voices as the three men read that they now have rewards posted for them, dead or alive, while Mattie lectures the youngsters on table etiquette; and the two elder men attempt to while away the long period of enforced idleness by playing at bank robbers with the reluctant children – which ends in a fit of temper from the morose, drunken Chicamaw: ‘Goddammit, play the game or else!’

Appropriately, the icons of the period loom pathetically large on the horizon of these depleted lives – literally so in the scene in which their hold-up of one bank is trammelled by the arrival of a truck carrying a giant coke bottle and surrounded by a mob of children – and Altman keeps tabs on the small adjustments to their hopes and ambitions through the details of dress and hairstyle. T-Dub dyes his greying hair when he sets up home with Mattie’s younger sister Lula; Keechie’s intimations of maturity are traced through the transformations of her hairstyle from her Little Orphan Annie look at the outset. And although he has been criticised for indulging the ‘Polly Platt syndrome’, Altman is singularly successful at working the continual rattle of radio tunes and ‘gangbuster’ serials as a real presence into the film, rather than simply as period evocation.

One scene in particular sums up the peculiar banality and sadness of this tale of absolutely predetermined life and death: ‘It’s going to rain,’ announces Chicamaw, staring bleakly outside; and sure enough, in the next shot, the camera pulls back from rain on the windows to discover Mattie’s boy lying on the floor, reading in the half-light by the yellow glow from a radio dial, while a voice crackles: ‘Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?  The Shadow knows!’
