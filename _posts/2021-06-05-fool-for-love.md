**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away the film’s ending.**

It’s impossible not to see this adaptation of Sam Shepard’s _Fool for Love_ in relation to his script for _Paris, Texas_, and difficult to believe, given the similar casting of Harry Dean Stanton, that some sort of family resemblance was not intended. This could be a continuation, or a ‘prequel’, or simply another version, an ‘alternative universe’ treatment, of the earlier film’s family history. The Stanton character is now back in the trailer where he was living, before _Paris, Texas_ began, with Nastassja Kinski and their child. The fire that violently ended that relationship, sending Stanton out into the desert where he was picked up at the beginning of the film, is now the ending of  
_Fool for Love_, with the character willingly consigning himself to the flames. On the other hand, the action here presupposes that the travelling man who disappeared at the end of _Paris, Texas_, having reunited two thirds of his family, went on to found another, and that this polarised universe was then bound to become one, its atoms rushing heedlessly to reunite and destroy themselves.

A science-fiction interpretation of this joint scenario seems as reasonable as any other. The forces unleashed within it – the madness, the mystery, the unfulfilability, of love – have a kind of alien purity that doesn’t lead to emotional catharsis (although both films have their big scenes of revelation and declaration that nominally serve this purpose), but to a rarefied, a cosmic, geometry of the emotions. Shepard’s melodrama doesn’t so much recall Douglas Sirk as the early novels of Kurt Vonnegut: sarcastic and self-mocking, with similar characters and incidents orbiting around one another. This might, of course, be the final development of the cowboy mystique – whether as parody, satire or celebration doesn’t really matter. Shepard’s prose – say, in _The Motel Chronicles_, which is somewhere at the basis of _Paris, Texas_, if only as a mood – is a search for essential truths, objects, events. A cowboy leanness of statement combines with an intergalactic thinness of atmosphere.

Something so perfect in form also comes close to having no form at all; each of those prose-poem-statements is carried away by its own ineffable lightness of being. Which explains why the similar materials of _Paris, Texas_ and _Fool for Love_ have made such different films; the vaguest _metteur en scène_ would perforce become an auteur when adapting Sam Shepard. The most obvious difference between Wenders’ and Altman’s films is that the first is in perpetual motion and the second stands stock still. The first, of course, was written as a screenplay and the second adapted from a play, but both have put their own construction on the void in the West that both surrounds and is the subject of everything that Shepard writes, the terrible interplanetary hollow after the madness of love has blasted through, or has yet to visit.

The travelling in _Paris, Texas_, after the blast, is another of those illusory Wenders odysseys to put it all back together, to reassemble the pieces of identity, home and family; within this rather achingly constructed void, another chimera, another searcher beckons – a Fordian figure who first set Wenders chasing chimeras, giving him an image for the loss of identity that this cinema had brought about in the first place. Altman, it must be said, is more rigorously post-Western when it comes to this kind of landscape: the opening pan across the desert in _Fool for Love_ takes in no chimeras of Monument Valley; Altman’s most characteristic camera movement thereafter, the slow zoom in and out, isolates and freezes every action, permitting no references beyond the immediate _huis clos_. The irony is that director, writer and characters are very movie-conscious. Without giving the nod to any particular film, _Fool for Love_ acknowledges that this is a movie-made world, whether as a fact of social life (‘There’s not a movie in a hundred miles that can match the story I’m going to tell,’ declares Eddie, winding up to his revelatory scene) or as truth-and-illusion irony (‘You can take it. You’re a stunt man, right?’ says May to her felled cowboy, having carried out her threat to exact her revenge in the middle of a kiss).

This last comment is the only clue in the film to what Eddie actually does for a living, as opposed to his own self-mocking posturings (‘If you ain’t a cowboy, you ain’t worth shit’) or the mock-mythic grandeur conferred on him by the film, as he first appears, striding from his truck against a livid evening sky, and accompanied throughout by a number of nouveau Western ballads on the soundtrack (which sing of love and jealousy and the ‘Wyoming Man’ whose ‘heart beats for Cheyenne’).  As befits the post-post-Western mood, the photography has the metallic hardness, the preternatural clarity of those European cameramen who have followed Robby Müller in their attraction to the Western void (here Pierre Mignot, Altman’s regular for several films now). Shepard’s double participation in the film, as the intellectual playwright and his own creation, both mythic icon and rodeo cowboy with a high-pitched twang, sets up its own strange reverberations. It pushes the Western significance somewhere beyond parody and self-consciousness, to a point, for instance, where the film can combine and portray the Arthur Miller who wrote  _The Misfits_ and the Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift who starred in it.

It’s a point where Altman may have been for some time: not social criticism in the vein of _MASH_ or _Nashville_, or genre criticism like _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_ and _The Long Goodbye_, but some extension of both into the strange life forms of _3 Women_.  That 1977 film, in fact, already had a proto-Shepard in its cast – its only male character was a make-believe cowboy, Hugh O’Brien’s stand-in on TV’s _Wyatt Earp_ – a similar washed-up civilisation in the desert (the Purple Sage apartments instead of the El Royale motel), and a similar sense that a void must be the busiest place in the world, forever replicating old life forms or germinating new ones. The question of which it is would determine whether the void is sterile or fecund, and on this point both films are ambivalent. It’s also a properly science-fictional question, and Altman, who has recently created many such future conditional worlds, or states of mind, may be more attuned to this quality in Shepard than Wenders, who is always trying to pick up messages from the past.

_3 Women_, which begins with Sissy Spacek arriving at the Purple Sage apartments having run away from home, and ends with her perhaps about to leave her reformed ménage in the desert, moves in a circle. _Fool for Love_, which begins with May staring out of the kitchen window at the El Royale, towards the highway and Eddie’s inevitable approach (‘You know we’re connected. We’ll always be connected. That was decided a long time ago’), and ends with her description of how her mother was left after her evanescent father’s last disappearance (‘She’d be standing in the kitchen, just staring at the sink’), does something similar. Eddie and May’s compulsive love-hate relationship is a doubling of that past marriage, or rather a doubling of a doubling, as the final suite of flashbacks makes clear. Eddie and May are the progeny of one father and two mothers, who both had an all-consuming passion for their ambivalent, even neatly divided spouse, given to protracted, unexplained absences. When May’s mother finally tracked him down by some in-built radar to the town where he lived with Eddie’s mother (‘She knew she was crossing into the forbidden zone, but she couldn’t help herself’), the result was inevitably a collision of worlds, a cosmic big bang (Eddie’s mother shot herself) and a reformation of the constellations, a charging of different particles (the adolescent half-brother and sister) with the madness of love.

But these recollected scenes (the voiceover of the recollector always slightly at odds with what is shown) don’t play like flashbacks in the conventional sense. They have a crisp narrative dynamism of their own that makes them more like one of those Moebius strip plots that are so popular now – back to the future for more time twinning. Similarly, the _coup de théâtre_ that sets them in motion – Eddie’s revelation that he and May are brother and sister, discovered too late, after they had already ‘fooled around’ – doesn’t really play as such. It’s a mechanism to set all these processes of dividing, doubling and twinning in motion, like the similar scandalous revelations of _Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean_: mastectomy, mistaken birth and two sexes being conjured out of one. Even the old man’s terse explanation for his two-way family life – ‘It was the same love. It just got split in half, that’s all’ – attests to some biological need becoming a scientific principle for splitting emotions like atoms. And flashbacks finally have no place here because the past is always present – as Altman demonstrates in his own _coup de théâtre_, having the family then and now become joint residents at the motel. What he finally, sublimely, fills Shepard’s void with is a wealth of parallel universes.
