How is it possible that a film whose entire narrative is framed as a prolonged crank call to Gabon’s then-president Omar Bongo is not a mainstay of the retro/cult screening circuit? Altman’s pungent, unloved satire – about two aberrant hipster high-schoolers and the summer they spend terrorising the right-wing, nouveau-riche suburbanite Schwab family – not only repays repeated viewing but almost demands it with its ultra-scathing humour and typical ‘controlled chaos’ structure. Leisurewear’d patriarch Randall Schwab (Paul Dooley), head of Arizona’s Schwab Insurance, makes a hell of a hate figure, citing ‘drinking’ and ‘the continent of Africa’ as personal bugbears on his hilariously shonky, western-inspired television infomercial. Though one might view the film as a more sophisticated, less winsome retooling of John Hughes’s _Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_ (1986), it’s more in the anarchic spirit of _Nashville_ or _Brewster McCloud_, and Altman clearly has no time for learning, trusting, bonding, growing or symbolically taking a boot to daddy’s Ferrari: _O.C. and Stiggs_ celebrates teenagers as wild, impulsive, obstructive, obnoxious and politically astute, thereby making a complete mockery of the so-called teen movie.  
**David Jenkins, _Sight & Sound_, June 2011**  

**A contemporary review**

_O.C. and Stiggs_ is a film haunted by ghosts. The ghost, first of all, of its own non-appearance: filmed in 1983, under the title _The Ugly, Monstrous, Mind-Rousting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs_, it was shelved by MGM and has only had a limited video-test run yet to make its theatrical appearance in the U.S.  It is haunted most wickedly by Altman’s reputation as a satirist, since it stands in the dwindling line of those frescoes, from _Nashville_ through _A Wedding_ to _HealtH_, which attempt to take America in a large metaphorical embrace.  Here the satire was authored by two _National Lampoon_ Magazine writers,  Tod Carroll and Ted Mann, and is a peculiar mixture of juvenile pranks (mostly directed against the Schwab ménage, epitome of all that is gross, materialistic, racist and stupid) and pious self-pity on the part of its eponymous heroes. When one of the most incidental and barely established characters, Melvin Van Peebles’ Wino Bob, is found dead in a back alley, Stiggs waxes righteous, ‘I don’t suppose the Phoenix Liquor Association has a policy for burying dead winos.’ O.C.’s summer is meanwhile blighted by the imminent removal of his grandfather to an old folks’ home, and his being sent to live in Arkansas with an uncle ‘who has seven wrecked automobiles on his lawn’.

Altman has described this pair as rebels who have decided ‘that they shouldn’t listen to anything their parents or teachers tell them, because they might grow up to be like them’. But if Randall Schwab Snr is, admittedly, a deliciously realised caricature of reactionary bluster, with a particular phobia about miscegenation (‘I don’t like coloured ice-cream’), the unpleasant mockery of O.C. and Stiggs, directed against all and sundry (their triumph is winkling two gay teachers out of the closet), hardly seems morally superior. Their contempt for the Schwabs is only equalled by their enthusiasm for the music of King Sunny Adé and his African Beats, but there is a patronising edge here too, perhaps because, in either its positive or negative moods, the film is never far from comic-strip exaggeration. Salvation for O.C. and his grandfather finally arrives with a cheque for $42 000 from dress manufacturer Paul Coletti, who has turned his Phoenix backyard into a Tahitian idyll (‘I wonder what the poor people are doing tonight?’, he muses, meaning his own sweatshop workers), and who is given a bright idea by the boys for marketing his line of clothes for fat women. In this context, the only possible satirical point would seem to be that O.C. and Stiggs must inevitably grow up to be Schwab and Coletti.  But the film operates by giving them a (thoroughly undeserved) moral _carte blanche_ while glibly trashing everything around them.

That said, the final ghost engaged with here is the shade of those other fantasies which Altman has set in the desert – _3 Women_, _Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean_, _Quintet_ (a desert in negative). In this clime, Altman is able to imagine an America that is both a dream and an essential caricature of what exists everywhere else. When Stiggs’ mother, who spends the movie rehearsing for a production of _Cactus Flower_, asks if there are cacti in Arkansas, O.C.’s future home, her husband retorts, proudly, ‘Arkansas is one of the United States. All America is the same’. This, for Altman, seems to be the most maddening thing about his country, and in the desert sameness blooms with the similarly maddening repetitions of a dream, (or the pointless extravagance of terminal forms of life). There’s evidently a cultural critique here, but it’s not satire in the usual sense, and the juvenile high-jinks of _O.C. and Stiggs_ are best ignored for its richer sense of the local flora and fauna.  The former would include the cacti that sprout everywhere, even in the food, in Stiggs’ home, because his mother is ‘living’ her part in _Cactus Flower_. And the latter is at its wittiest with Dennis Hopper playing _Carry on Apocalypse Now_, bringing the war back home to the firework fight the boys are engaged in with Schwab, and remarking pleasantly, when they protest that the grenade he has tossed them is real, ‘Everything gets to be sooner or later, man’.
