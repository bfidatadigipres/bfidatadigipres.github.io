**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

ln the attempts to ﬁnd an explanation for _Quintet_, it has been likened to _Images_, the art-house ﬁlm Altman made at a time when he was thought to be one of the pacesetters (_MASH_, _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_) in the New Hollywood genres. _Images_ has deﬁnitely entered the record as an aberration: one of those essays in European sophistication by ambitious American directors, who in the process forgo the sophistication of their native cinema (all the compressed emotional, thematic and symbolic meaning of a highly evolved narrative tradition) for the sake of the literal representation of an ‘idea’. Altman turned out a Laingian case history which held up a mirror, in fact all sorts of reﬂecting surfaces, to a disaffected personality.

But _Quintet_ is cannier than that. It reveals the awareness of post-_Nashville_ Altman that art (or truth, or life) is not something created by avoiding Hollywood clichés – the conﬁdence of this period is also that he is no longer in danger of being overwhelmed by the old Hollywood – but an elusive or illusory goal that sustains the work in progress but is a doubtful commodity once it is complete. In this respect, it is almost anti-_lmages_ – since it declares the ‘art’ ﬁlm a null and void pretension – and one of the purest of American ﬁlms. It is a story without a subject, a form without meaning. For Altman, also, it has a kind of purity: if _A Wedding_ positively sits up and begs to be liked, _Quintet_ sits with its back to the audience and deﬁes them to stay. It has stars, of course, but they are scarcely allowed to act in a way with which audiences could be expected to identify.

This makes it, along with _3 Women_ and (to a qualiﬁed extent) _Buffalo Bill and the Indians_, Altman’s most audacious work. Beyond that, it is the most extreme statement of the rationale of all those ﬁlms. Too large to be called their theme, too amorphous to be called their subject, Altman’s concern with ‘performance’, with what happens to truth when one tries to ﬁnd it through illusion, explains why those ﬁlms were made. It is a nagging worry that crops up in pre-_Nashville_ Altman, drifts drunkenly through that ﬁlm, and now crystallises (leaves a masking of frost round the very frame, in fact) in _Quintet_, the ‘point’ of which, after all, is simply the game, quintet itself, a barren and meaningless thing, but the only thing there is.

In outline, the story would make a perfect Western, although the ﬁlm in no way engages with Western elements, and certainly does not set itself against them, as do _McCabe_ and _Buffalo Bill_. Instead of resisting convention, it accepts the mythic, apparently conﬁdent that its own nihilism is powerful enough to resist such a strain. Essex (Paul Newman), a seal hunter by trade, is making his way at the beginning across a snowbound waste, in an unspeciﬁed era, resignedly returning with his pregnant wife Vivia (Brigitte Fossey) to the city from whence he came and where his brother and family still live. Sources of food in the outside world now seem to be exhausted, and life in general is coming to an end. The city proves to be an inert, cheerless place: a bare, ramshackle honeycomb, coated with ice, where people huddle in rags waiting to die (and roving packs of dogs instantly move in on the remains) or, if they are lucky enough to have the calling, engage in the one life-giving activity (though its end, too, is death), the game of quintet.

The rules of the game remain obscure, but at the highest level it is orchestrated in citywide tournaments, and players’ names are circulated on pieces of paper, which establish who is entitled to hunt down and kill whom, depending on the outcome of the games. Soon after Essex’s arrival, one player, Redstone, evidently not abiding by the roles, disposes of Essex’s brother with a bomb which also kills the rest of the family, including Vivia. Before Essex can reach him, Redstone is killed by another player, St. Christopher (Vittorio Gassman). On the body, Essex ﬁnds one of the lists of names, and subsequently passes himself off as Redstone in order to penetrate the coven of tournament players and ﬁgure out the ‘system’ behind the game and the meaning of it all.

One of the singular aspects of this plot is that it has little emotional resonance. Essex’s quest is pursued less out of the instinct for revenge than out of the need to know; and audience interest (where it has not already been discouraged by this appearance of po-faced allegory) is sustained by the faint hope that, if not the rules of the game, then some faint glimmer of the context in which it is played will be revealed. Given the mysteriousness of what the characters are actually doing when they gather round the quintet board, there is little that can be deduced about the ﬁlm from the actual tactics of game-playing. (Essex’s brother is also a collector of quintet pieces, and in one of the ﬁlm’s more ‘signiﬁcant’ lines, Essex explains what is meant by this example of a ‘hobby’: ‘That’s just something to do for no reason’.) _Quintet_ is not, in other words, akin to those Boetticher Westerns described by Andrew Sarris as ‘ﬂoating poker games where every character took turns at blufﬁng about his hand, until the ﬁnal showdown.’ A fascinating parallel, however, because it anticipates _Quintet_ in plot and supplies the direct resonance that it lacks, is a little-acknowledged Western of 1960, _One Foot in Hell_ (director, James B. Clark). Alan Ladd, as an ex-Confederate with a chip on his shoulder, rushes his pregnant wife into an Arizona town, where the locals’ hostility to him as a stranger prevents him from getting the medicine she needs, and she dies.  Now taken somewhat guiltily to the bosom of the community, he becomes a leading citizen and is eventually appointed sheriff. But rehabilitation proves merely to be a cover for his long-gestating revenge against the men most responsible for his wife’s death.

The relevance of this is that it suggests where the meaning of _Quintet_ might lie: in its sense of community, and the hero’s degree of adjustment or oppression within it. But the signiﬁcance here is special to Altman, and has little to do with any vision of the post-holocaust world. On the level, say, of Boorman’s _Zardoz_, the allegory of _Quintet_ is a non-starter, although it might be thought to share some of the artefacts of Boorman’s ﬁlm: its peculiar sense of costuming, for instance, whereby the citizens who are not merely heaps of rags affect a kind of Renaissance splendour, or the bits and pieces of a burnt-out culture that have gone to make up the eerie latticework of the city, or Essex’s reminiscences to Vivia at the beginning about the city he remembers with a park, a lake and trees.

In particular, it would be difﬁcult to reach any speculative conclusions about the government of the city, which seems to be divided between the mystic  St. Christopher, who lives up to his name by tending the needy with soup kitchens and spiritual bromides (‘You must cherish your tortured life, because it is a pause, an interruption in the void preceding and following it’), and the amiable, pragmatic but obscurely all-powerful adjudicator Grigor (Fernando Rey). The latter is the most curious ﬁgure, his enthusiasm for quintet and specious justiﬁcations of it representing a reactionary, death-oriented power more sinister than the opponents Essex, having become ‘Redstone’, must face over the game. The casting of Rey might even suggest a pointed reference – _The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie_ in _Nanook of the Northland_ – were it not for the fact that Altman never seems to make references to other ﬁlms.  His own work, perhaps, is too caught in the contradiction of being at once supremely unselfconscious – he is not interested in examining or reﬂecting the processes of his own imagination – and self-centredly obsessed with how that imagination might be most fully embodied in ﬁlm. And Grigor’s frustrating function here is the true measure of his villainy.
