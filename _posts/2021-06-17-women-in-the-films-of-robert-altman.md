_We are delighted to announce that film critics Anne Billson and Hannah McGill, as well as season programmer Geoff Andrew, will join us for this discussion hosted by film programmer Rowan Woods._

Robert Altman made films which were in many ways quite different from those of other directors – not only those who’d come before him, but those (mostly younger than he) who made their mark at around the same time in the late 1960s and early ’70s. This difference was not merely a matter of his innovative techniques and stylistic tropes, but of his films’ content and concerns. Unlike the ‘movie brats’, whose main interest seems to have revolved around revitalising the traditional Hollywood genres, Altman’s primary focus of attention was America itself; not just its inhabitants, but the political and social structures, the cultural values and the myths which circumscribed, constrained and shaped their lives. So it was perhaps unsurprising that Altman – whose early years had been, by his own admission, deeply influenced by the many women in his life (not only his mother and sisters, but his aunts, a cousin and the African-American maid who became his confidante and fostered his love of jazz) – should make so much space for women in his movies. There were, of course, the films centred on or populated mainly by women – _That Cold Day in the Park_, _Images_, _3 Women_, _Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean_ and _Dr T & The Women_; but there were also movies like _Thieves like Us_, _Nashville_, _A Wedding_, _Short Cuts_, _Kansas City_, _Cookie’s Fortune,_ _Gosford Park_ and _A Prairie Home Companion_ in which the experiences, emotions and thoughts of women lie at the heart of the narrative. Few American directors of Altman’s era focused so frequently or so attentively on women characters; today’s discussion will look at how he depicted them during his long and prolific career as a filmmaker.
