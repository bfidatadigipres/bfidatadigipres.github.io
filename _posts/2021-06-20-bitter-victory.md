Two officers leading a mission to attack Nazi headquarters in the Libyan desert come into conflict, due partly to sexual jealousy, partly to differences in capability and courage in facing the perils of war. Ray – always expressive with horizontals – and cinematographer Michel Kelber use the expanses of the ’Scope frame to turn the arid landscape into an arena of deadly rivalry and private anguish.<br>

_Bitter Victory_ is a very characteristic Nicholas Ray film: there is a spectacular lyric pain in sustained passages; it is always suggestive of uglier or lovelier things unsaid or unshown; like lightning in its action scenes; but flawed – in this case by the intractable limitations of Curd Jürgens (Ray had wanted Montgomery Clift) and Ruth Roman. Like all Ray’s best work, the more overt the action becomes, the more surely we discover depth in characters who have a greater doubt and self-awareness than is common in American pictures. Time and again, over 15 years, he made insecurity the focus in people, rejecting Hollywood’s industrial confidence and vigour.

The just war against the Germans in North Africa in _Bitter Victory_ takes second place to the temperamental hostility of fellow officers – it is a study in grace and shabbiness (like _The Savage Innocents_) and to Richard Burton’s wintry refusal to regard life as more than a trap or an anachronism. It is a CinemaScope picture of unfailing visual crisis. The close-ups on the stretched screen are among the most sombre images of exposed loneliness ever filmed. In one sequence, Burton has to shoot a wounded soldier and then labours to carry another on his back, only to find the burden has died too, after dreadful agony: ‘I kill the living and save the dead.’ It is one of Ray’s grimmest jokes, resigned, mirthless and apocalyptic.<br>
