_Hope and Glory_ is a bold example of a film refusing to tailor itself to the supposed requirements of the substantial international audience that it presumably needs. The meticulously detailed suburban street in which  ‘Bhin-Tal’ stands (and falls) constituted one of the largest studio sets built in Britain since Hitchcock recreated an East End neighbourhood at Lime Grove for _Sabotage_. The domestic audience available to that film in 1936 was considerably larger and more stable than it is now, and Hitchcock also took the precaution of bringing over a leading lady from Hollywood, Sylvia Sidney.  The one recent British film that compares with _Hope and Glory_ in setting and scale had Richard Gere, and the title of _Yanks_. In contrast, _Hope and Glory_ refuses all the obvious temptations to court an American audience in casting or content. Its narrative ends in late 1942, just before Americans came to England in a big way; its Canadian is not (as has been known to happen) an honorary American, his French affiliations being stressed; Pearl Harbour, and the American entry into the war, gets not even the smallest passing reference.

The key motif in the film, moreover, is a cricketing one. David Puttnam tried for years, in vain, to set up a film about Don Bradman and the 1932 ‘bodyline’ series; he was ready, reportedly, to change all the LBW dismissals into catches, so as to make the action more comprehensible to audiences familiar with baseball. Boorman, splendidly, admits no such compromises over the intricacies of the ‘googly’-the wrist-spun offbreak bowled, deceptively, with the action of a leg-break. Clive, about to depart for war, teaches the secret of the googly to his son: the son will, in due course, use the googly to bowl out his grandfather, and then the returning father himself.

This googly is, in a typical Boorman rite of passage, the direct agent of Bill Rohan’s progress towards maturity through the symbolic overthrow of the father. But it also functions as a metaphor for the deceptive intricacies of human motivation and behaviour (his own included) which Bill has to learn to master. When his father first explains the googly, his response is shock: ‘That’s like telling fibs’. But ‘fibs’ are all around him. His mother insists that she can’t cope if her husband goes to war, but will actually enjoy and prefer his absence; Bill himself resists evacuation to Australia, but protests just as violently when his mother claws him back; his teenage sister Dawn lives her life as a dizzying series of contradictory signals to boyfriend, family and self. The war itself looks like disaster but is experienced as joy. The pattern is so insistent that it might easily have become tiresomely schematic, were it not for the richness of the main performances (Sammi Davis’ Dawn above all), and the rigour and delicacy with which the film is centred upon the consciousness of the boy.

Intelligently cast and directed, and playing a convincing game of cricket, Sebastian Rice-Edwards as Bill looks at times uncannily like Anthony Wager as the young Pip in David Lean’s _Great Expectations_. And he dominates the film structurally in the manner of Pip himself: by his look, by intermittent voiceover, and by his virtual omnipresence. Time and again, scenes between adults (e.g., Clive and Mac talking politics, Grace and Molly talking of men) turn out to have Bill as a half-observed witness. The only exceptions to this are some brief scenes involving Dawn’s affair with Bruce, and even these are like extrapolations from what Bill does witness between them. The result is an intricate double perspective, notoriously less easy to handle in the ‘objective medium of cinema than with the written word: we witness these scenes of World War Two, but as filtered through the subjectivity of the youth perceiving, and the narrator remembering – very much as we do in David Lodge’s fine novel/memoir of the war and after, _Out of the Shelter_ (1970), a book which makes a fascinating cross-reference to _Hope and Glory_.

Here both youth and narrator are, of course, John Boorman. For the closeness of film to life, see Michel Ciment’s book on Boorman, or indeed the film’s publicity, but the identity is made explicit enough on screen from the start: the camera moves in slowly on a still photo of the family and superimposes the final panauthorial credit on the face of Bill, whereupon the first-person voiceover begins. _Hope and Glory_ belongs to the rare film genre of autobiography, a mainstream companion to the Bill Douglas trilogy: looking at it another way, Boorman has written a childhood autobiography on film the way Michael Powell wrote his on paper, and in very much the same spirit. ‘All my life I have loved running water’: Powell’s first sentence in _A Life in Movies_ has its almost precise equivalent in the last line and image of _Hope and Glory_.  It is tempting to pursue the analogy between autobiographies, and oeuvres, at some length: suffice it to say that _Hope and Glory_ confirms Boorman as a worthy inheritor of Powell’s role as the great risk-taking romantic of (or at least with one foot in) British cinema.  
**Charles Barr, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, September 1987**

When John Boorman gave the first draft of the script of _Hope and Glory_ to his eldest daughter Telsche she tossed it back to him after 20 minutes. ‘You couldn’t possibly have read it so soon,’ he cried. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘I skipped all the stories I knew, which didn’t leave much, did it?’ _Hope and Glory_, the story of a wartime childhood, does it must be said chiefly register as a series of family stories. But it is Boorman’s achievement to have told them with fresh enthusiasm, and to have made the film more than the sum of its parts. One is not made to feel like the polite stranger at the chattering family table.

What makes _Hope and Glory_ singular, if not quite unique, is its tone.  It sometimes shades into sentimentality. Boorman has acknowledged with gratitude the influence of growing up in a family dominated by forceful women and of having three daughters of his own; and he has, not unnaturally, several soft spots. But the sentimentality rarely gets out of hand, even in the potentially perilous but in fact very funny school scenes, and it is occasionally inflected into genuine feeling, as, for example, in the night train journey back to London after the seaside outing, when Grace and Mac come close to speaking their hearts. But sentimentality is only an undercurrent. Boorman knows how to write and direct scenes which play in the cinema. He understands scale, and he has too, unexpectedly, an eye and an ear for understated comedy.  Bill and his fellows recite the nine-times table in gasmasks lined up along  the side of the school shelter: in the mumbled litany one hears one unmistakable raspberry.
