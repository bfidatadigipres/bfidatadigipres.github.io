**A contemporary review**

Fashion means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. It can be seen as an industry, as a social phenomenon or as an art-form. In his latest film, _Prêt-à-porter_, Robert Altman is mainly interested in fashion as social phenomenon, although he is personally well aware of its status as art. Talking to an interviewer, he observed, ‘I think that many designers are hype artists but that the majority of these people are real artists. That’s very clear.’ Nonetheless, as he noted immediately afterwards, ‘Actually, I don’t really deal very much with the designers and what they do. It’s much more about media and related product and hype.’ The problem, of course, is that without the art the hype appears pointless. The fashion world may caricature itself, unconsciously as well as consciously, and it may be cruel and absurd, but it is more than that. Without an acknowledgement of fashion’s potential as art and thus as a value betrayed, Altman’s satirical treatment of fashion loses its edge and begins to spin around in a grotesque vacuum. If he had taken the clothes more seriously, the satire would have carried more weight.

_Prêt-à-porter_ is set in a world in which two or three genuine artists show their work, which is then drowned out by a kaleidoscopic rabble of supermodels, journalists, publicists, self-publicists, celebrity clients and assorted hangers-on and riffraff. Altman is interested in clothes and the role they can play in our behaviour, in our construction and projection of a self, in our obsession with image. He is amused by the fashion world in terms of its ethnographic peculiarities, its rituals and status systems, its propensity for farce. Fascinated by the glitz of the catwalk, he is not really committed to showing clothes as artefacts in themselves, as anything worth looking at seriously. For example, the re-creations of vintage Dior worn in the film by Sophia Loren are surely of enormous interest, constructed as they were from Loren’s original fitting body (still retained by the house) and cut by Monsieur Claude, the same craftsman that worked there in the ‘50s when she was already a customer. Unfortunately, they are scarcely visible in the snappily edited film – much too long on its first cut – and we have to hope that the outtakes are deposited for future scholars in a fashion museum.

_Prêt-à-porter_ is essentially a backstage fashion-show movie, in the same sense that _Nashville_ was a backstage musical. Altman embeds fashion shows in a French facade in the same way that Frank Tashlin embedded rock ’n’ roll numbers in the framing narrative of _The Girl Can’t Help It_. We are given – very rapidly – just three major set-piece runway sequences, which display supermodels the traditional Ziegfeld way, the stately promenade modernised to frenetic catwalk (the key historical reference point here being Ossie Clark’s proto-MTV introduction of pop music into his shows during the ‘60s). But _Prêt-à-porter_ misses its chance of becoming a _Girl Can’t Help It_ for future fashion cultists and connoisseurs. Tashlin’s film, which set out to poke fun at rock ’n’ roll, is still lovingly watched today not so much because of its gags or its social satire, but because it inadvertently immortalised a series of great moments in music history.

At the very end of his film, Altman gives the fashion show an anti-fashion twist by turning it into a public exhibition of nudity, with the female body as a site of authenticity, in contrast with the inauthenticity of fashion. Watching this update of The Emperor’s New Clothes, I was reminded of Rudi Gernreich’s experience with his topless bathing suit of 1964, which he deliberately chose not to show on the catwalk. Gernreich’s use of nudity in fashion caused a flurry of press publicity but had very little lasting impact on fashion itself. It was too risky, too ‘philosophical’. Twenty years later Peggy Moffitt, Gernreich’s principal model, threatened to resign from the Los Angeles Fashion Group if the topless suit was modelled on stage at a retrospective of Gernreich’s work. Moffitt protested that ‘Rudi did the suit as a social statement. It was an exaggeration that had to do with setting women free. It had nothing to do with display and the minute someone wears it to show off her body, you’ve negated the entire principle of the thing.’ Altman has argued that the presence of Ute Lemper, nude, eight and a half months pregnant, in the climactic runway sequence of _Prêt-à-porter_, ‘took the titillation out of it’. Even if this were true, it still comes across as hype, exploiting shock effect to outdo the fashion world and establish Altman himself as cock of the walk.<br>
