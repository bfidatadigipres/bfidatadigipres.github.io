**A contemporary review**<br>
John Grisham is a true publishing phenomenon and Hollywood has been eager to turn his stories into movies, especially after the massive success of Sydney Pollack’s version of _The Firm_ in 1993. Since then there have been: _The Pelican Brief_ (Alan J. Pakula, 1993), _The Client_ (Joel Schumacher, 1994), _A Time to Kill_ (Joel Schumacher, 1996), _The Chamber_ (James Foley, 1996) _John Grisham’s The Rainmaker_ (Francis Ford Coppola, 1997) as well as a TV series based on _The Client_. Although a version of _The Runaway Jury_ (to be directed by _auteur manqué_ Philip Kaufman) is promised, the last so far is _The Gingerbread Man_.  In it Kenneth Branagh plays Rick Magruder, a successful lawyer who gets involved in the problems of a young woman who is being stalked by her father, a religious fanatic. Things escalate when the father escapes from the asylum where Magruder had had him committed and then threatens the lawyer and his children. If one throws in the inevitable chases, rescues, murders, courtroom manoeuvring and such, this will not seem very different from the other ﬁlms mentioned above. All in fact are reasonably faithful adaptations, with Coppola’s clearly being the most effective and Schumacher’s the shoddiest, but _The Gingerbread Man_ stands out in many ways, not least because it is not strictly canon.

Robert Altman’s 1997 ﬁlm is in fact not taken from a novel but is based on an original screenplay that Grisham had written many years previously. Although its protagonist is a lawyer, as with all his books, this story is actually closer in feeling to _ﬁlm noir_ with its dark atmosphere (literally and metaphorically-speaking) and with a _femme fatale_ ably manipulating the hero, and it relies less on courtroom procedure for its plot twists and turns. It is however also hard to know how much of this is Grisham’s doing as, by the time the ﬁlm was released, his screenplay credit had been reduced to merely one for ‘original story’. When speaking with _Entertainment Weekly_ Robert Altman stated that he had never even talked to Grisham ‘..or met him. I wouldn’t know him if he fell in my soup’. Indeed, the production itself was beset with problems and setbacks almost as tortuous as the ﬁlm’s plot.

When ﬁrst announced, the ﬁlm was envisioned as a straightforward rendering of Grisham’s script, with Annette Bening co-starring and with Luis Mandoki (_White Palace_, _Message in a Bottle_) directing, with ﬁlming due to begin in the middle of October 1996 in Memphis, Tennessee. However, this was not to be, with Bening announcing her withdrawal on discovering that she was pregnant. Subsequently, Mandoki also departed and Branagh himself moved on to make _The Proposition_ (then known under the title _Shakespeare’s Sister_). The script passed through several hands (including, brieﬂy, that of neo-_noir_ maestro John Dahl) before eventually being accepted by Robert Altman. Altman may have seemed an odd choice to helm a John Grisham story, with Stephen Amidon of _The Times_ considering it ‘a bit like Salvador Dalí designing the next Ford sedan’. It certainly didn’t help that the one time that he had attempted to make a straightforward thriller from a best-selling novel, William Goldman’s _Heat_, he had been ﬁred almost immediately (amongst many others incidentally). But his presence quickly impressed Branagh and so ﬁlming eventually began at the end of January in 1997 in Savannah, Georgia, by which time Altman had overhauled the script (now credited to the mysterious ‘Al Hayes’). The cast was as large and eclectic a mix as one would expect from Altman, including newcomer Embeth Davitz as the woman in jeopardy, Robert Duvall as the father and Famke Janssen as Magruder’s ex-wife, as well as Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Downey Jr, who was under a court order during the ﬁlming. Post-production was fraught with problems: when Altman’s ﬁrst cut (in which the ﬁlm ends _before_ the protagonist’s eventual fate is determined by the courts) was tested and disliked by audiences, production company Polygram took the ﬁlm away and re-edited it, at which point Altman threatened to remove his name from the credits and replace it with the Director’s Guild infamous pseudonym Alan Smithee. Subsequently co-producer Chris Black left Polygram over their handling of the editing, and when the new version fared no better with test audiences, Altman was allowed to complete his version, which was eventually released, though barely.

Since the ﬁlm wasn’t based on any previously published material, it has the advantage of seeming much fresher than previous adaptations, which may well have been what attracted Altman in the ﬁrst place. _The Gingerbread Man_ is by comparison a thoroughly dour ﬁlm that eschews the David and Goliath approach that is standard in Grisham’s plotting, and is peopled with characters that are much more subtly shaded and realistic. Branagh’s Magruder is a deeply ﬂawed man, a choleric, combative and arrogant ﬁgure clearly going through some sort of mid-life crisis. In the ﬁlm he is much more believable and compromised than any of the main characters in Grisham’s other ﬁction, while his scenes with the excellent Davidtz and Janssen bristle with emotion.

At the same time, the ﬁlm has many examples of Altman’s mordant wit and talent for telling detail such as the picture of the Gingerbread Man on the wall at Magruder’s children’s school, or the sly way in which Davidtz’s character is introduced when we see her palming an ashtray early in the ﬁlm. Al Clark in his seminal book _Raymond Chandler in Hollywood_ described Altman’s method and ﬁlms as ‘… cool, dispassionate, observant, outwardly anarchic but vigorously disciplined within their chosen sphere’. This is certainly true of his handling of _The Gingerbread Man_ and there are many distinctively Altmanesque moments, such as in the early party scene in which Magruder and Mallory Doss ﬁrst meet, and in his handling of the large crowds in a later sequence set in a large market. In his _Guardian_ interview held on 23 May this year, Branagh praised Altman’s improvisatory technique and mastery in the handling of large crowd scenes ﬁlled with extras.

While Altman’s adaptation of Chandler’s classic _The Long Goodbye_ is an extraordinary explosion of the private eye myth, his take on Grisham is less revisionist and certainly less severe. Although his pessimism and misanthropy and cynical mistrust of authority remain, the plot is left largely in place and there are a number of very suspenseful sequences as well. Also notable is as a well-realised Hurricane (named Geraldo) which recalls the storm at the climax of _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_ and which was added by Altman to the script. It blows for the majority of the ﬁlm, making the characters, in critic Philip French’s words, all appear to be suffering from PMT – ‘Pre Monsoon Tension’. This is brilliantly realised by Chinese cinematographer Changwei Gu who keeps the colour palette incredibly limited, only using explosions of red for certain sequences while managing to make Savannah seem both immediate and real as well and exotic and alien.

Though obviously an uneasy alliance, the ﬁlm provides enough of Grisham’s plotting and Altman’s trademark skill with actors and assured style to provide a ﬁlm that is both entertaining on a purely narrative level and altogether more satisfying on an aesthetic and emotional one.<br>
