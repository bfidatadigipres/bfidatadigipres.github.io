**What’s it about?**

Last time we met Dreamworks’ Stone Age family the Croods they had left their cave and started a new life. An encounter with the Bettermans – who claim to be more evolved – sets the two families up against each other, but they soon find themselves having to work together when their daughters go missing. This hotly anticipated follow-up to 2013’s first instalment promises comedy and adventure galore.



**The Croods: A New Age**

The Croods have survived their fair share of dangers and disasters, from fanged prehistoric beasts to surviving the end of the world, but now they will face their biggest challenge of all: another family.

The Croods need a new place to live. So, the first prehistoric family sets off into the world in search of a safer place to call home. When they discover an idyllic walled-in paradise that meets all their needs, they think their problems are solved … except for one thing. Another family already lives there: the Bettermans.

The Bettermans (emphasis on the ‘better’) – with their elaborate tree house, amazing inventions and irrigated acres of fresh produce – are a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder.  When they take the Croods in as the world’s first houseguests, it isn’t long before tensions escalate between the cave family and the modern family.

Just when all seems lost, a new threat will propel both families on an epic adventure outside the safety of the wall, one that will force them to embrace their differences, draw strength from each other and forge a future together.

_The Croods: A New Age_ features the voice talent of returning stars Nicolas Cage as Grug Crood,  Catherine Keener as Ugga Crood, Emma Stone as their daughter, Eep; Ryan Reynolds as Eep’s boyfriend, Guy; Clark Duke (_Hot Tub Time Machine_) as Thunk and Cloris Leachman as Gran. They’re joined by new stars Peter Dinklage (HBO’s _Game of Thrones_) as Phil Betterman, Leslie Mann (_Blockers_) as Hope Betterman, and Kelly Marie Tran (_Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi_) as their daughter, Dawn.

The film is directed by Joel Crawford, who has worked on multiple DreamWorks Animation films, including _Trolls_ and the _Kung Fu Panda_ franchise, and is produced by Mark Swift (_Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie_, _Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted_).
