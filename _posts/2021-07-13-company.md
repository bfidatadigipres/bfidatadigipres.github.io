Whether in Warner Bros Depression-era spectacles like _42nd Street_ (1933), flamboyant offerings such as Powell and Pressburger’s _The Red Shoes_ (1948) or even Carlos Saura’s _Tango_ (1998), it’s a convention of backstage musicals that the lead-up to a new production will always be fraught: the nervous tension will build, the relief come only with performance. With typical iconoclasm, Robert Altman eschews this approach in _The Company_. Master of the freewheeling ensemble piece, he is more interested in how a ballet troupe functions day to day than in delivering melodramatic flourishes or final reel catharsis.<br>

In particular, Altman strives to contrast the formal perfection the dancers seek in performance with the unruliness and banality of their off-stage existences, characterised by Altman in the press notes as ‘the same messy stew that we all experience’. Pitched somewhere between drama and documentary (and shot on high-definition video), _The Company_ is a ‘messy stew’ itself. Barbara Turner’s sprawling screenplay introduces various characters whose stories seem set up for deeper exploration: the young company member reduced to sleeping on a friend’s floor; the veteran ballerina fiercely resistant to change; the choreographer with off-the-wall ideas for a new ballet; the young dancer dropped for not picking up a routine quickly enough. But the narrative style is deliberately elliptical and impressionistic: rather than set out to resolve such dilemmas, Altman uses them as illustrative of the complexities of lived lives. Most of the performers are real members of Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet but Altman is equally oblique in his treatment of the three leads, drawn from outside the profession: rather than dwell on the personal lives of newcomer and would-be principal dancer Ry (played by co-producer Neve Campbell), her sous-chef romantic interest or troupe leader Antonelli, Altman repeatedly cuts away from what are apparently key dramatic sequences to return to the rehearsal room.

The crucial performance sequences are handled admirably: often shooting long, Altman has clearly listened to Fred Astaire’s old dictum that ‘either the camera dances or I do’ and largely resists elaborate montage sequences or editing tricks. We are treated to some extraordinarily expressive routines: Campbell and Domingo Rubio performing a delicate _pas de deux_ on an open-air stage during a thunderstorm, a mesmerising solo dance featuring one of the company members curling herself into wreaths with a rope, the colourful (if kitsch) ‘Blue Snake’ ballet which rounds off the movie.

The stresses and inadvertent comedy of company life are well captured, without romantic illusion. In one telling scene, a ballerina straight out of a Degas suddenly snaps a tendon and, helped off stage, is promptly and unemotionally replaced. Malcolm McDowell’s Antonelli comes across as a camp latter-day Diaghilev, bedecked in a series of yellow and orange scarves, but for all his mannerisms and brusqueness he is presented as a heroic and even visionary figure battling to ensure the company’s welfare and the quality of its members’ performances.<br>

**Robert Altman on ‘The Company’**<br>
Dancers do the impossible. And yet we all want to be them. They are that beautiful, that vulnerable, and that expressive. They are the essence of what we mean by ethereal. Their lives, of course, are the same messy stew that we all experience, complete with the complications of families, lovers, friendships, and work. I want _The Company_ to show this world with all of its contradictions. Here are world-class artists who, for the most part, are poorly paid and live hand to mouth, often in very unglamorous conditions. They take immaculate care of their bodies while smoking countless cigarettes, downing endless cups of coffee and working punishing hours. Their daily reality includes bloody feet, bludgeoned ambitions, and the work itself – in all of its demanding beauty.

What thrilled me most about making this film was simply being allowed into this particular tribe of artists, dreamers and human beings. On a daily basis, and in the most impossible and dramatic terms, dancers face what we all face: biological clocks and the force of gravity telling us ‘no’. Yet for some part of their working lives dancers literally prevail over those forces. The fact that they (like the rest of us) will all ultimately be trumped by time doesn’t diminish or compromise their efforts. It only enriches them… and us. I am privileged to have been allowed into the world of the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet and privileged to have the opportunity of sharing it in this film.<br>
