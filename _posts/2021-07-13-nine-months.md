**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Márta Mészáros’ first film in colour shocked some contemporary audiences with its final documentary scene. Pushing the boundaries of traditional family, Juli (Monori) has to be resourceful to juggle study, work and single parenthood. Jan Nowicki plays János, whose love might be guided more by social compliance than personal passion. This often uncompromising drama of mismatched aspirations places domesticity and work as characters alongside the individuals.<br>

With the international acclaim that followed _Adoption_’s Berlin Film Festival Golden Bear, Márta Mészáros then made international co-productions, shot in colour and starring non-Hungarians like Jan Nowicki (with whom Mészáros had a lengthy relationship), Marina Vlady and Isabelle Huppert. A common factor in _Nine Months_ (1976), _The Two of Them_ (1977) and _The Heiresses_ (1980) is the extraordinary Lili Monori, who became the quintessential Mészáros protagonist via riveting studies of complicated, conflicted and frequently unsympathetic young women.

Monori’s fearlessness as a performer extended to her giving birth for real in _Nine Months_ (Mészáros, having gone through the process more than once herself, was disinclined to soft-pedal its treatment here), and her often stormy relationships with Nowicki’s characters (her boss in _Nine Months_, an alcoholic in _The Two of Them_, a principled army officer in _The Heiresses_) are counterpointed by electrifying double-acts with her female co-stars.<br>

Lili Monori represented a completely different style of acting, she acted differently, she existed differently to other actresses. She is unchecked, she lives with every fibre of her being, she suffers or delights if needs be – it’s not acting. I feel very close to this style of play. I like it when an actor can cry and laugh in the same scene. … When I told her that I wanted to make a film with her it turned out she was pregnant. This is exactly what the film is about. I wanted her to give birth in front of the camera. It came as no surprise when she agreed.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
Beginning with shots of a blazing furnace and ending with a full-frontal birth sequence, _Nine Months_ provides a sensitive but unequivocal illustration of the forces that determine the female condition.

Its dumpy, phlegmatic heroine, veering from the passionate to the rational with weary stoicism, finds scant comfort in solitude but even less in the company of the man who insists she abandon it for his sake. Yet in the icy courtyard where he begs her to come for a drink, a side of meat, recently butchered, steams with red warmth; it is flesh, as usual, that wins the battle, and the film’s love scenes, intense and intimate in persistent close-up, directly communicate the girl’s physical needs. Undoubtedly she is right to avoid matrimonial imprisonment with the charming but limited János and his vindictive family, but the film doesn’t deny the raw reality of the new baby, its birth punctuated by the memory of János and his furnaces; the final images of motherhood have a frozen neutrality.

This is the sixth full-length feature by Jancsó’s filmmaking wife Márta Mészáros (although the first to find distribution in Britain), and while its support of women’s liberation is made vividly clear, the argument is the more successful for these ambiguities. The film in fact provides no easy solution to the dilemma of independence-versus-dependence, and while its male characters seemingly get the best of the bargain, they are finally in as much of a conventional trap as the hapless Juli.

However, she is far from being a conventional victim, given Lili Monori’s performance; apart from one decorous tear provided just a touch too neatly on cue, her solemn gaze – interrupted occasionally by amazing flashes of vulnerability – conveys a wealth of texts, reducing the need for propaganda to a minimum. Her nine-month purgatory is honourable, real and genuinely touching.

The film’s other triumph, appropriately enough for Ms Mészáros first essay in colour, is the golden, Breughelesque brilliance of the photography by János Kende, with its magnificent long shots of the misty landscapes of industrial Hungary. The style, fortunately, owes nothing to Jancsó (bar one intricately serpentine movement inside the house that reveals decorators in every room), but the eye for detail is as acute. As a result, this account of bleak loneliness contains a reassuring array of consolations.<br>
