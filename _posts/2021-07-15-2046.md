Five years in production, at least intermittently, _2046_ presents itself as Wong Kar Wai’s magnum opus. It’s set in the Hong Kong of the late 1960s, but includes flashbacks to the protagonist’s earlier life in Singapore as well as a number of fantastic extrapolations from the film’s present that are notionally set in 2046. It chronicles one man’s successive relationships – sexual and/or romantic – with four women, but each liaison is haunted by the man’s memories of an earlier relationship with a married woman that never quite coalesced into an affair. That intense non-affair, the greatest emotional experience in the man’s life, was explored in Wong’s previous film _In the Mood for Love_ (2000) which ended with the man trying to exorcise his memories by ‘burying’ them in a hole in the walls of Angkor Wat.

The conceit here is that the hole in the wall becomes ‘2046’, a time/space where nothing changes, a site where nothing is lost and so everything can be found, a repository for everything that has been repressed, blocked, denied or deferred. In the film, ‘2046’ is both the number of a hotel room, where one woman is gravely wounded by a jealous lover, another is cruelly rejected by the man she loves, and yet another practises Japanese to rehearse her elopement with her forbidden Japanese lover, and the title of a newspaper serial written by Chow Mo-Wan, in which he revisits his memories of affairs past and present in science-fiction terms. By naming it _2046_, though, Wong suggests that the film itself is a giant ‘hole’ into which everyone – including, of course, himself – can whisper their secrets. That’s why _2046_ is loaded with references to and evocations of Wong’s previous films, and why it feels like some kind of summation of his career to date. Fans of an auteurist bent will find enough here to keep them busy for months.

Just as _Fallen Angels_ (1995) became the darker flipside of _Chungking Express_, so _2046_ inexorably turned into the shadow film of _In the Mood for Love_ part sequel, part revision, part remix, part aftermath. As the sci-fi elements shrank, the desire to return to Hong Kong in the 1960s swelled. In interviews Wong has sometimes compared _In the Mood for Love_ to a drug on which he was hooked, and so you could see _2046_ as a film designed to feed an addiction. But Wong was clearly a reluctant addict: he undertook numerous side-projects to distract himself from the struggle to refocus the conception of _2046_. The biggest was _The Hand_, his episode for the portmanteau feature _Eros_ (2004), generally recognised as the best in that film (the other episodes are by Steven Soderbergh and Michelangelo Antonioni). Others included a short compilation of archival clips edited to the song ‘Hua Yang de Nianhua’, the music video _Six Days_ for DJ Shadow and advertising shorts for Lacoste and BMW. Wong also launched a successful subsidiary company to manage artists, which has led to Jet Tone opening branch offices in Shanghai and Taipei and seems to have solved its cash-flow problems.

Wong summoned me to Bangkok in late April 2004 to help with the film’s subtitling, and the days I spent in the Ramindra Sound Studio with the Jet Tone crew gave me some insight into its difficult birth. Wong was still filming pick-up shots of Tony Leung and Gong Li when I arrived, while the sleepless William Chang had set up an Avid editing suite in the lobby of Ramindra and was working round the clock to prepare reels for the sound mix. A last-minute rush is the norm for a Wong Kar Wai production; I remember waiting in the lobby of a Hong Kong theatre in 1994 for the world premiere of _Chungking Express_ because the theatre manager refused to start the screening until more reels had arrived from the lab. All this means, of course, that Wong is one of those artists who needs a real deadline to force himself to make the difficult final decisions about his work and sever the umbilical cord. In the case of _2046_, though, I got the strong impression that the film had ‘clicked’ in Wong’s mind only very recently. What I witnessed was not a rush to complete the film but a rush to complete an interim approximation of the film in time to meet – more or less – the Cannes deadline. More editing, shooting and voiceover recording took place in the months after Cannes, all of it designed to finesse the film Wong now knew it should be. The definitive version premiered in China on 20 September [2004], with openings in Hong Kong and Taipei a few days later.

I’d begun working on the subtitles earlier in April in Hong Kong, and I reckon I processed 30-40 minutes of material that didn’t make it into any cut of the film, most of it scenes between Chow Mo-Wan and Miss Bai, one of his neighbours in Room 2046. I don’t know how much other footage was axed, but it’s clear that Wong had decided to drop most of the sci-fi scenes well before he decamped to Bangkok. Gone in its entirety is the strand of Chow’s ‘2046’ story based on the doomed romance between bar-girl Lulu and the nightclub drummer who stabs her in Room 2046; this reduces Carina Lau’s role to a few enigmatic appearances in which Lulu claims – or affects – to have forgotten meeting Chow in Singapore, and reduces Chang Chen’s to a couple of brooding, jealous stares. Also gone is nearly all the strand involving Thongchai Maclntyre and Kimura Takuya; two brief shots survive in a phantasmagoria early in the film, prefiguring Chow’s decision to write the ‘2046’ stories. And the one sci-fi strand which still runs through the film – based on the illicit romance between the hotel owner’s elder daughter Jingwen and her Japanese boyfriend – has been drastically pruned.

The corresponding decision, which determined the overall structure of the film, was to centre it on Chow’s successive relationships with the four women. Each relationship is different, and only one of them is directly sexual (the torrid affair with Miss Bai, which Chow breaks off with maximum emotional cruelty by suddenly treating it as a paid transaction), though there’s a strong implication that Chow and Lulu dated each other in Singapore some years earlier. But the four form an emotional continuum, ranging in tone from humour (Jingwen ghost-writing a martial-arts serial for the flu-stricken Chow) to pathos (Gong Li’s role as a femme fatale from Phnom Penh: a gambler who never loses but never takes off one black glove, as if to hide a prosthetic hand replacing a real hand severed for cheating). If _In the Mood for Love_ was a paean to the staying power of choked-back emotions, then _2046_ is a set of symphonic variations on the theme of unfulfilled love. It comes to no startling conclusions (luck in love is largely a matter of timing, lovers have an endless capacity for misleading themselves and each other, and so on), but it dramatises each vagary of the heart with an intensity rarely found in the movies.<br>
