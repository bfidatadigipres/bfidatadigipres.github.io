Like _In the Mood for Love_, _The Hand_ is set in the hazy Hong Kong of the 1960s, but its characters couldn’t be more different from the earlier film’s restrained, haunted lovers. Originally conceived for the omnibus film _Eros_, the film – presented in this retrospective for the first time in its extended cut – tells the tale of Zhang (Chang Chen), a shy tailor’s assistant enraptured by a mysterious client, Miss Hua (Gong Li).

A hypnotic tale of obsession, repression, and class divisions, _The Hand_ finds Wong Kar Wai continuing to transition from the frenetic, energized style of his earlier films into a register that is lush with romantic grandeur.<br>
**Production notes**

Multi-director portmanteau films are a dangerous format: they don’t merely invite but virtually compel invidious comparisons. The classic example is _New York Stories_, which cruelly exposed the decline in Francis Ford Coppola’s creative skills by teaming him with an on-form Scorsese and a Woody Allen near his best. _Eros_ is an even more embarrassing exercise, since it was apparently conceived as a respectful homage to the nonagenarian Michelangelo Antonioni. But of the three segments on offer, his is by far the weakest.

Unusually for the portmanteau format, _Eros_ starts out with its longest and strongest segment. _The Hand_, shot in deep, rich chiaroscuro by Christopher Doyle, is suffused with the yearning, muted eroticism that director Wong Kar Wai has made himself a master of. It’s set in Hong Kong and begins in 1963. Virtually a two-hander (in more ways than one), it traces two contrasted trajectories: as an initially nervous apprentice tailor gradually gains in confidence and experience, the once imperious courtesan he adores sinks to the most abject depths of her profession.

Their relationship is bookended by two hand jobs, which might seem squalid but Wong deflects any such risk, treating both episodes with a delicate sensuality. When the couple first meet, the courtesan masturbates the young man with lofty contempt, as if to imply that this is all he’s worth. ‘Never touched a woman before, have you?’ she demands as her hand strays between his legs. ‘Then how can you be a tailor?’ Years later, dying, she offers him the same service – but this time, her body wasted and ravaged by disease, she’s giving him all she has left to give. Gong Li and Chang Chen, both pitch perfect, play out this doomed erotic dance with affecting subtlety.<br>
