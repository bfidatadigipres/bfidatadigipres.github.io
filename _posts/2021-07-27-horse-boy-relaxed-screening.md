**Before the film we will screen a short pre-recorded discussion between Rupert Isaacson (Producer/narrator) and Benjamin Brown, series curator.** 

Reaching the end of their tether, Texas couple Rupert and Kristin whisk their troublesome four-year-old autistic son Rowan across the world in a desperate bid to restore balance to their disorderly lives. A film where nature’s limitless healing properties are foregrounded, the Outer Mongolian steppes serve as the perfect, Zen backdrop for an emotional, near transcendental rite of passage for the family.

This is the first of three relaxed screenings presented in response to _The Reason I Jump_, programmed by independent curator, Benjamin Brown.

‘Really, our vision of the world can be incredible, just incredible …’ – Naoki Higashida, _The Reason I Jump_

Whether neuro-diverse or neurotypical, as human beings we are all born with our own unique ways of perceiving the world. However, for many on the autism spectrum, the problem comes when trying to impress that unique perspective onto others through words and gestures. Like a detuned radio, the signal is blocked, coming through only as hissing static.

Channelling several themes explored so effectively by _The Reason I Jump_, the season expresses the key role of the senses in our everyday lives and the transcendent power of nature to provide consolation to the inconsolable. It also conveys the vital importance of giving autistic people a say in how we are treated, and to extend us our rightful seat at society’s table.

As Naoki so poetically puts it, ‘if, by our being here, we could help the people  of the world remember what truly matters for the earth, that would give us a  quiet pleasure.’<br>**Benjamin Brown, Series Curator**
