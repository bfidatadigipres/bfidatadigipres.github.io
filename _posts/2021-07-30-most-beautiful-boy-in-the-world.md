_‘His face recalled the noblest moment of Greek sculpture – pale, with a sweet reserve, with clustering honey-coloured ringlets, the brow and nose descending in one line, the winning mouth, the expression of pure and godlike serenity. Yet with all this chaste perfection of form it was of such unique personal charm that the observer thought he had never seen, either in nature or art, anything so utterly happy and consummate.’_ – Description of the young character Tadzio in Thomas Mann’s novel, _Death in Venice_.

_‘The boy was exquisitely beautiful. He is fragile. And that is beautiful… on film. You have to be very careful with such children.’_ – Margareta Krantz, Swedish casting director for _Death in Venice_.

In 1970, filmmaker Luchino Visconti travelled throughout Europe looking for the perfect boy to personify absolute beauty in his adaptation for the screen of Thomas Mann’s _Death in Venice_. In Stockholm, he discovered Björn Andrésen, a shy 15-year-old teenager whom he brought to international fame overnight and led to spend a short but intense part of his turbulent youth between the Lido in Venice, London, the Cannes Film Festival and the so distant Japan.  Fifty years after the premiere of _Death in Venice_, Björn takes us on a remarkable journey made of personal memories, cinema history, stardust and tragic events in what could be Bjorn’s last attempt for him to finally get his life back on track.

**Directors’ note (Kristina Lindström and Kristian Petri)**  
_The Most Beautiful Boy in the World_ is a story about obsession with beauty, about desire and sacrifice, about a boy whose life was changed forever when the film director Luchino Visconti declared him to be the ‘world’s most  beautiful boy.’

Who was this boy and what happened to him? This is the story of a film that destroyed someone’s life.

It is also a story of family secrets, of searching for the truth.

We filmed _The Most Beautiful Boy in the World_ during five years in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, Budapest, Venice, and Tokyo, following in Björn’s footsteps. We searched together with him to learn the truth about his mother’s death and his father’s identity by reaching into the archives and interviews with close family.

We searched for people who had crossed his path over the decades. It was naturally difficult to find some of them after 50 years, but miraculously many of them were available and willing to talk on camera. The rich archive material which we found throughout the process was also a big source of joy.

The base for everything has been trust and Björn’s courage and wish to tell  his story.

We believe in interesting questions more than in simple answers. This is not an easy story. We hope it is gripping. We hope that Björn will come forward as the complex and interesting person that he is. This is a story with many layers, a box within a box within a box.

This film lets us listen to the boy’s own story. He, who was made into an image by others, an icon, a fantasy, which took over his young life.

**Producer’s note (Stina Gardell)**  
_The Most Beautiful Boy in the World_ is, at its core, a film about objectification and the effects it can have on an individual.

Beauty is admired and can open many doors, but the world’s obsession with someone’s appearance can tear that person apart on the inside.

As the native American tale goes: ‘For every photo taken, a little bit of one’s soul is taken away.’

_The Most Beautiful Boy in the World_ is the untold story of a fascinating life about a boy who becomes a star at a very young age, and how that came to influence the rest of his life. Fifteen-year-old Björn Andrésen seduced both men and women with his role in _Death in Venice_, and he forever became a gay icon.

‘He sees me as a piece of meat on a plate,’ was Björn’s own words about the director Luchino Visconti. How does it affect someone to be viewed as an object? Where does the sense of self go?

Few child stars manage to live up to the expectations of their early exposure, which the public never forgets.

Today, 50 years later, Björn Andrésen still lives in the shadow of his 15-year-old self. For many years he continued to make a career in the limelight – in film, as a model, and as a musician. Björn continued to be drawn to the world that broke him. Is there something in his nature that wants to be recognised?

As a producer, there were several reasons why I fell for this story.

Björn’s life story is fascinating, he has a rich life behind him with many depths and global moments. It takes us to 1970s Italy, to the world of Japanese advertising and to the old bohemian Paris. Everything has been archived and we had access to the material.

We meet Björn today in the film, but we also find him in the archives.

Björn’s motivation to regain his self-respect is the core of this film. It is a process of discovery, where he goes back into the past in order to regain something that has been lost. It was interesting to me that this story about beauty and objectification is about a man. To explore this topic, which is often centred around women, from a different gender perspective felt right.
