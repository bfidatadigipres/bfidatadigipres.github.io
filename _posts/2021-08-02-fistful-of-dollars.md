In Britain, Morricone is best known for his work with Sergio Leone. As Bernard Herrmann is to Alfred Hitchcock, Nino Rota to Federico Fellini, John Barry to James Bond and John Williams to Steven Spielberg, Morricone is – for many – to Leone. It is well-nigh impossible to recall Leone’s films in the mind’s eye or ear – from _A Fistful of Dollars_ (1964) via _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ (1966) to the very different _Once upon a Time in the West_ (1968) and _Once upon a Time in America_ (1983) – without Morricone’s music. So close was the creative partnership between composer and director that Leone once described it as  ‘a marriage like Catholics used to be married before the divorce laws were reformed.’ Morricone returned the compliment by saying: ‘Leone wanted more from music than other directors – he always gave it more space, more room to breathe.’

The resulting films were mythical melodramas, with Morricone supplying the melo. From the early whipcracks, bells, whistles, anvils, Italian folk instruments, incomprehensible lyrics and Fender Stratocaster riffs – which may well have been distant spin-offs from Morricone’s researches into John Cage and the idea that all sounds belong to the realm of music – to the melancholy, yearning score for _Once upon a Time in America_, with its wistful use of pan-pipes and dense orchestral textures, the work of these two artists ran on parallel lines. The opening bars of _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_, with their ‘Ay-ee-ay-ee-ay’ coyote howl are among the most instantly recognisable in the history of  the movies.

And yet Morricone was always hyper-sensitive about his association with ‘spaghetti westerns’. Whenever I interviewed him, he would make clear from the outset that if I so much as mentioned the phrase ‘spaghetti westerns’, he would walk out. ‘I don’t compose things that we eat.’ When Quentin Tarantino sent him the script of _Inglourious Basterds_ (2009), he told me, the tense opening sequence included the stage direction ‘This is a real spaghetti western moment’: he closed the script there and then and sent it back. And he was at pains to point out that even during his most prolific period in the 1960s and 1970s – when as Bernardo Bertolucci once joked ‘you barely saw a major Italian movie without music by Ennio’ – he only scored 35 westerns, or less than ten per cent of his oeuvre. Only 35! That’s almost as many as Elmer Bernstein (_The Magnificent Seven_, 1960; _True Grit_, 1969, et al), Dimitri Tiomkin (_Red River_, 1947; _High Noon_, 1952, et al) and Jerome Moross (_The Big Country_, 1958) combined…

Morricone always emphasised the distinction between ‘_musica assoluta_’ (absolute music, the concert work) and ‘_musica applicata_’ (the film and television work); and within those categories, between his more serious film work and rotgut ‘spaghetti westerns’ (a phrase he did not apply to Leone’s films). This sensitivity had something to do with a certain unease about his reputation among members of the elite musical establishment in Italy and especially Rome: this meant a lot to him, and he felt it was something he hadn’t quite achieved. Close association with ‘spaghetti westerns’, for him, lowered the tone.

Morricone started to experiment with writing music for Italian films in the late 1950s, with his first credit in 1961 (Luciano Salce’s _Il federale_). When Leone was seeking someone to write the new-style music for his first western, he discovered he had been at primary school with Morricone in the mid-1930s, and the two men were meeting again for the first time in 28 years. They hit it off immediately and Morricone was hired to compose the music for _A Fistful  of Dollars_.

_What was your working relationship with Sergio Leone?_

I have to say it was entirely loving and supportive. Every once in a while, it’s true, he would get angry for a minute or I would, then his wife Carla would come over and say, ‘Shut up, you two, stop it.’ There was total trust between us, and that’s what you need to work well together.

_You created a distinctively Italian sound for the ‘western all’Italiana’ – the maranzano, the arghilophone, these are Italian folk instruments, aren’t they, which had never been used in that context before – and it’s a whole world away from Aaron Copland and his students Elmer Bernstein and Jerome Moross and all those big symphonic scores for American westerns based on American folk tunes…_

You can find the arghilophone in Korea and Germany as well as Italy. No, if Leone’s Italian westerns had been set in China I would have written the same music. I wasn’t influenced by the place and therefore neither by American or Italian folklore, so I just put in the tones, the sounds that felt right.

_What about the whistling, which you were to use in 30 of your scores?_

I can’t remember how that happened. I just came up with the idea and Sergio liked it and decided to use it in the first film, and then he wanted it in the second one as well and by the third I had to say, ‘That’s enough now, no more whistling, we’ve used it too much’ – and so we used the coyote howl instead in _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_. In the concert version, though, I didn’t have the voice or the arghilophone, so I simply gave the part to the clarinet.

_And there was the use of the human voice as a musical instrument – with the soprano Edda Dell’Orso taking the female vocal line, from_ For a Few Dollars More _onwards: this, too, was to prove very influential on soundtracks such as_ Gladiator _[2000]._

...because the human voice is the most amazing instrument that exists!  We don’t need an instrument; we are the instrument – it’s us, our body.  The voice can do anything and that’s why I love it as the principal instrument. We’re used to beautiful, sweet voices, but then there are terrible voices as well – subhuman, dramatic, the voices of evil people, terrible people. In the tone of voice you can represent either...
