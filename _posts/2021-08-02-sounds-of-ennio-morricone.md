To launch the Ennio Morricone season, we gather together a panel of special guests to  discuss Morricone’s celebrated career as the cinema’s foremost film composer. Through clips and lively conversation our speakers will explore how Morricone approached film scoring, brought experimentation to his most memorable compositions, worked with directors across various genres, and influenced the next generation of film composers.

We are delighted to announce that composer, musician and BBC presenter Neil Brand, film and TV composer Nainita Desai (_For Sama_ and _The Reason I Jump_), and academic, musician and broadcaster Helen Julia Minors will join us for this discussion hosted by Justin Johnson, season curator and BFI Lead Programmer.

Neil now has a very fruitful relationship with the BBC Symphony Orchestra with his acclaimed orchestral scores for Hitchcock’s silent _Blackmail_ (commissioned by Cinema Ritrovato, Bologna), the BBCSO / Barbican commission to score Asquith’s silent _Underground_, Chaplin’s _Easy Street_ (released on DVD/Blu-Ray) and Fairbanks’s _Robin Hood_. His most recent scores are for Hitchcock’s _The Lodger_, and Jackie Coogan’s _Oliver Twist_ (premiered by Ben Palmer and the Covent Garden Symphonia). He is published by Faber Music.

Following a degree in Maths, Nainita began her career working as a sound designer on features for directors including Werner Herzog and Bertolucci and assistant music engineer to Peter Gabriel. Nainita moves seamlessly between working with orchestras, to scores utilising her collection of custom made instruments, incorporating electronics and found sound which has informed her experimental, deeply immersive approach.

**Ennio Morricone: 1928-2020**  
In 1968 nothing could be less cool than the sound of a pop orchestra. Yet the way most people first heard the coyote call from Sergio Leone’s epic western _The Good, the Bad and  the Ugly_ (1966) was through Hugo Montenegro’s plodding hit single. It did not prepare you for Ennio Morricone’s shock-of-the-new original: an out-of-this-world melding of weird vocal sounds, ocarina, flute, Mexican trumpetry, machine-gun effects and surf guitar. That coyote  call was Morricone’s breakthrough, a rallying cry to experience the greatest of all composers  on screen.

Raised in the hunger-ridden open-city Rome of World War II, Morricone learned trumpet as a child so he could stand in for his musician father. Studying composition at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory was thought odd for a trumpet player, but composing quickly on paper became his métier. Against advice, the restless graduate worked pseudonymously as a pop song writer and arranger for the likes of Paul Anka and Charles Aznavour, plus theatre, radio and TV, all of which became a financial necessity when he married Maria Travia in 1956 and started a family.

It could have been a straightforward versatile career in pop and lounge music, but Luigi Nono’s avant-garde vocal piece _Cori di Didone_ in 1958 and a seminar by John Cage further opened Morricone’s mind. He would eventually join the Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza, a loose collection of avant-garde composers. In the meantime his first film score was for Luciano Salce’s _The Fascist_ (_Il federale_, 1961). It began an avalanche of film music of stunning invention, amounting to more than 500 scores.

The game-changing collaboration with Leone began with _A Fistful of Dollars_ (1964) – the director had not remembered they were at primary school together. Morricone played Leone his adaptation of Woody Guthrie’s ‘Pastures of Plenty’, which already had the American folk-meets-avant-garde elements that defined their ‘spaghetti western’ sound (though this was a term you could not use in Morricone’s presence – he found it ‘disrespectful’: ‘Spaghetti is a thing you eat’). Leone trusted Morricone so much he often got him to write and record music before a shoot so that he could play it to the actors on set in films like _Once upon a Time in the West_ (1968) and edit the images precisely to fit his themes and character motifs. Westerns were a small part of his output. Among the scores that established his Italian reputation were Gillo Pontecorvo’s masterpiece of resistance struggle _The Battle of Algiers_ (1966), Dario Argento’s _giallo_ _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_ (1970), Pier Paolo Pasolini’s _Salò_ (1975 – ‘It’s not to my taste,’ he said), Bernardo Bertolucci’s historical epic _1900_ (1976), and Giuseppe Tornatore’s sentimental international hit _Cinema Paradiso_ (1988).

Hollywood came calling – Terrence Malick for _Days of Heaven_ (1978), Brian De Palma for  _The Untouchables_ (1987) and Warren Beatty for _Bugsy_ (1991). All those scores were nominated for Academy Awards, but Morricone kept his distance, refusing to learn English and, for a while, refusing Hollywood after finding he was being paid no more than average. His score for Roland Joffé’s _The Mission_ (1986), seen as a shoo-in for the Oscar (it went instead to _’Round Midnight_), got the fee bumped up ‘to the maximum’, but he had to wait until 2007 for an honorary Oscar. By then Quentin Tarantino was using fragments of his scores in _Kill Bill Vol. 1_ (2003) and _Death Proof_ (2007), a practice he continued in _Inglourious Basterds_ (2009) and _Django Unchained_ (2012). So it was a fitting climax when Morricone’s commissioned score for Tarantino’s _The Hateful Eight_ (2015) won him his second Oscar in a career showered with awards. What made the scores a seemingly bottomless well of inspiration was his insistence that good film music has to be as vivid and distinctive as the images – a harmonica aping twisting agony, deafening pocket-watch chimes counting down to a gunfight. The maestro of such dramatic tension, he made many bad films watchable and good films superb. He was an artist of his time, his scores so eclectic each is a thesis in postmodernism; yet, crucially, in an age that preferred riff, drone and repetition, he also had a great melodic gift. He could marry kitsch and high art, myth and glory in such ways as to make them heartbreaking or terrifying or whatever the film needed.
