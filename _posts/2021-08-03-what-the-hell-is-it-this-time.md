_+ intro by Edgar Wright_

Dive into the Maelstrom with this full-length live Sparks concert, filmed on their most recent world tour at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in May 2018. An infectiously energised performance of 22 tracks that span 5 decades of their musical genius, there is little wonder as to why Ron & Russell Mael are still luring in new generations of fans and making Top 10 albums, 50 years into their career.<br>

**The Sparks Brothers**<br>
The career of the ground-breaking pop pioneers Sparks – brothers Ron and Russell Mael – is an immaculate lesson in how to stay consistently interesting for 50 years. Internationally acclaimed, Sparks have released 25 creatively bold albums since their debut in 1972. Moving to London from their native Los Angeles in 1974, Sparks released their influential album _Kimono My House_, which quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, setting the tone for the band’s creative output to follow. Since that time, the musically vital pop pioneers have created a unique legacy both on record and in live performances.

The evergreen masters of the musical vignette, Sparks show no loss of appetite for their singular sonic adventures. Replicating the critical and commercial success of their 2017 album _Hippopotamus_ – which featured on countless Album of the Year lists – the band’s latest album _A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip_, released in 2020 to global acclaim, became their second UK top 10 album since 1974, when _Kimono My House_ and _Propaganda_ reached number 4 and 9 respectively.

Now entering their sixth decade, 2021 will see the eagerly awaited premiere of the movie musical _Annette_, the first English-language film from groundbreaking French director Leos Carax (_Holy Motors_, _Pola X_), a musical drama with original story, music and lyrics by Ron and Russell Mael and starring Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard and Simon Helberg. The band’s singular career is explored and celebrated in _The Sparks Brothers_, the eagerly-anticipated feature-length film by _Shaun of the Dead/Baby Driver_ director Edgar Wright, which saw its acclaimed premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.

Sparks are currently in the studio working on a new studio album and a new movie musical.<br>

**Edgar Wright**<br>
Growing up in the UK, Edgar Wright began crafting his distinct visual style directing Super 8 films starring his school friends. At 20, he directed the no-budget western _A Fistful of Fingers_, which had a limited theatrical release. This led to a foray into television, directing comedy shows including both seasons of the award-winning cult classic, _Spaced_. It was here that Wright began his iconic collaboration with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as well as his producing partner, Nira Park, with whom he has worked with on everything he has directed since.

_Spaced_ served as a launching pad for the 2004 film _Shaun of the Dead_ which became a sleeper box office hit. This was followed by _Hot Fuzz_ and _The World’s End_. These films became known as the ‘Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy’, all of which were co-written by Wright and Pegg. In between _Fuzz_ and _World’s End_, Wright co-wrote and directed the acclaimed _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_.

Wright has also collaborated with many acclaimed filmmakers: he co-wrote _The Adventures of Tintin_ for director Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson and directed the faux trailer for _Don’t_, which played between Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s _Grindhouse_ double-bill. As an executive producer, Wright championed Joe Cornish’s _Attack the Block_ and Ben Wheatley’s _Sightseers_.

Wright’s 2017 film, _Baby Driver_, starring Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, grossed over $220 million worldwide at the box office and went on to receive three Academy Award® nominations as well as two BAFTA® nominations, one of which it won for Best Editing.

In 2018, Wright and Park set up production company Complete Fiction Pictures with long-time collaborators Joe Cornish and Rachael Prior.

Wright’s latest film, _Last Night in Soho_, which he co-wrote with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, will be released in 2021. The film stars Thomasin McKenzie & Anya Taylor-Joy. Wright’s first documentary, _The Sparks Brothers_, covering the entire 50 year legacy of Ron and Russell Mael of California pop band Sparks, premiered at Sundance and will also be released in 2021.<br>
