_+ pre-recorded intro by film critic Leila Latif (Wednesday 4 August only)_

With so much of John Singleton’s film raging against the curtailing of life, it was painful to read of his sudden, recent death, aged just 51. His first feature is still powerful and relevant as it follows Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in his mission to leave LA’s Crenshaw ghetto. Charting the despair and tit-for-tat reality of gang life, it also gave Ice Cube a belter of a role as Doughboy, and a place on the soundtrack. Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett also make their mark as Tre’s parents, fully committed to a future for which they must fight.

_‘One out of every twenty-one Black American males will be murdered in their lifetime. Most will die at the hands of another Black male.’_

These two stark statements trigger John Singleton’s 1991 feature debut _Boyz N the Hood_. A hugely personal account of the type of gang violence that continues to blight so many urban communities, and was so prevalent during the then-film school graduate’s own upbringing in the South Central Los Angeles ’hood, Singleton’s achievement provided not only catharsis for himself but a film that resonated around the world.

Despite several incidents of violence during early US screenings – clearly unprompted by the film’s clear-eyed yet compassionate outlook – _Boyz N the Hood_ became one of the most acclaimed and the most profitable film of that year, garnering dual Oscar nominations for Singleton as writer and director (the youngest filmmaker to do so since Orson Welles). And it clearly, alongside Spike Lee’s growing body of work and the same year’s _New Jack City_, _Straight Out of Brooklyn_ and _Daughters of the Dust_, helped usher in the 1990s resurgence in black filmmaking.

While the film doesn’t have the bravura, in-your-face stylings of Lee’s 1989  _Do the Right Thing_ – a film that galvanised Singleton himself to tell his story – _Boyz N the Hood_ very consciously eschews more extravagant techniques to focus on its story. Which shouldn’t suggest that it’s lacking in its own cinematic ambitions. Indeed, it’s incredibly impressive that Singleton, who had never made anything longer than Super 8 shorts before this, was able to express himself and his world so evocatively and with such sophistication first time out.  
**Leigh Singer, bfi.org.uk, 27 October 2016**

John Singleton describes his impressive directorial debut as a film about ‘boys becoming men’, which pleads for ‘African American men to take more responsibility for raising their children, especially the boys’. Certainly, the theme of paternal strength is a key element in Singleton’s polemical narrative, in which each character’s chances of survival are defined by the presence or absence of a sturdy father figure. ‘I can’t teach him how to be a man’ declares Reva Styles as she hands her unruly child over to the character building custody of his father, Furious. ‘That’s your job’. This same obsession with an absence of guiding paternal power also underwrites Singleton’s analysis of the inter-black rivalry which renders the ‘hood dwellers impotent in their struggle for better living conditions. Just as Doughboy and Ricky are separated by the ghosts of their divided fathers, so the ‘hood dwellers turn upon each other because they have no common cultural leadership. Similarly, despite his brash pronouncements to the contrary, the adolescent Tre is revealed mid-way through the film to harbour a deep-seated fear of intercourse stemming from his terror of becoming a father – which he views as the ultimate burden.

Within this framework, Furious Styles serves not only as a father to Tre, but also as a prototype leader who will conduct his people out of the wilderness. His apparently unprovoked and prosaic address to the local citizens, wherein he lectures on the evils of white ‘gentrification’, may seem to jar with the harsh naturalism adopted elsewhere. But thematically it is entirely consistent; Furious is the voice of salvation, the absent father returning to restore order to the cultural chaos.

Directed with bold certainty by Singleton, _Boyz N the Hood_ thus emerges less as a portrayal of the rigours of urban life than a romantic elegy to the stable, patriarchal family unit. The film clearly addresses itself to young audiences, or more specifically young _male_ audiences. Singleton (it seems) is preaching not only to the fathers who currently fail their offspring, but to the children themselves, urging them to become the better fathers of the future.  
**Mark Kermode, _Sight and Sound_, November 1991**

Furious Styles is the name of the role model/father figure in John Singleton's _Boyz N the Hood_. The name tells you what drives Singleton's art: a sense of commitment and an interest in technical display. He turns the typical corning-of-age drama into an expression of the contemporary social pressures affecting young black American males, while also showing what sparks their imaginative lives. To realise how unusual this is for modern Hollywood , one need only contrast _Boyz N the Hood_ with the 80s Brat Pack films: in the former, black teens see life in terms of survival; in the latter, white teens see it in terms of fun.

Singleton is the most successful of the new directors at translating the swing and heat of hip-hop culture into cinematic language. Set in the culture of gang war and hardcore rap of strife-ridden South Central Los Angeles, _Boyz N the Hood_ follows four males from their pre-teen years to post-adolescence. One of the stars is Ice Cube (a former member of the rap group NWA), whose manner, both folksy and surly, is a key to the film’s matter-of-fact view of suffering. Singleton turns the sexual confession of lead character Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr), a ‘nice boy’, into a leering, hyped-up fantasy; the scene of older boys intimidating younger boys becomes a primal male myth, both intense  and pathetic.
