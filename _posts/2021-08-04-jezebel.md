_Jezebel_, that’s where the career really began to take shape. Hal [Wallis] found _Jezebel_ for me. I remember David Selznick wanted to sue us because we came out with it just before _Gone with the Wind_. But in a way I think it was truer to the feeling of the South at that time than his film. I’ve always felt _Gone with the Wind_ would have been twice as good if it had been in black and white, more intimate, smaller. It’s a pity these days that you have to film in colour, you can’t make what is essentially a black and white subject in black and white. _Baby Jane_ would have been much too pretty in colour. On the other hand, _Elizabeth and Essex_ and _Mr. Skeffington_ would have been marvellous in colour. But in the Thirties, the studio was only allocated two colour films a year, because it was so expensive and there was only one process, Technicolor. Those of us who made money at the box office never got colour films because we didn’t need that extra attraction. They gave the colour to the terrible scripts, as an added inducement to get the public in.  
**Bette Davis interviewed by Margaret Hinxman, _Sight and Sound_, Winter 1971-72**

_Jezebel_ is not entirely typical of the thirties cycle of Romantic Old South films, and contains a number of variations on the plantocracy theme which suggest a slightly less idealised image of the antebellum milieu. The iconography of the Old South is clearly present, of course, complete with magnificent estates, gentlemen planters and chivalrous officers, well-mannered belles, devoted family retainers, and so on. Typically, the focus is on the planter aristocracy, and we get hardly any sense of the wider social context, such as the crucial factor of slavery (which supported the plantocracy) or the presence of other classes of white Southerners.

But where the film excels is in its characterisation of antebellum social norms and mores. Much of this impulse is centred on the Bette Davis character, a Southern vixen whose curt manners disrupt the (usually unquestioned) social rules of Southern womanhood. This apparently subversive figure is nevertheless deeply rooted in Old South ideology – it is not aimed at challenging the plantocracy as such (Julie’s identification with the traditional Southern way of life is unambiguous), nor does it upset the genre’s otherwise comfortable image of the antebellum milieu.

But [William] Wyler introduces an element of humanism (and irony) into the representation, which previous Romantic Old South films either completely ignored, or simply subsumed under explicitly pro-South propaganda. This is particularly evident in the Henry Fonda character, Preston Dillard, whose relatively liberal polemic on the fundamental weakness of an economy based on slavery, for example, signals at least a partial rejection of nostalgia as the principle driving force behind antebellum dramas (cf. _Gone with the Wind_). _Jezebel_ can therefore be seen in terms of a development of certain generic conventions, not completely challenging the ideological constraints, but not completely identifying with them either.  
**Jim Pines, National Film Theatre programme notes**

**A contemporary review**  
Really brilliant acting gives a quite ordinary story vivid life and complete reality. Bette Davis has the courage to portray a detestable character. Julie is mean, cruel, selfish, and tyrannical. Her personality dominates the entire film, and her almost savage intensity has a quality which it is difficult to forget. The supporting players are competent, but have comparatively few opportunities of distinguishing themselves. William Wyler’s direction is imaginative and forceful. The old customs of the Southern States are quaint and interestingly shown. There are some terrible pictures of the funeral processions through the streets of the fever victims. Altogether this is a thought-provoking and stimulating picture, but some film-goers may find the Southern dialect difficult to follow.
