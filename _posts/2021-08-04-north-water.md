_+ Q&A with director Andrew Haigh and actor Sir Tom Courtenay (in person) plus live via Zoom, actors Colin Farrell and Jack O’Connell. Hosted by broadcaster  and critic Rhianna Dhillon._

Adapted for the screen and directed by Andrew Haigh, _The North Water_ features Jack O’Connell as Patrick Sumner, Colin Farrell as Henry Drax, and Stephen Graham as Captain Brownlee, alongside Tom Courtenay as Baxter. _The North Water_ also stars Peter Mullan, Sam Spruell and Roland Møller.

Set in Hull and on the ice floes of the Arctic in the late 1850s, _The North Water_’s location work took place primarily in the Arctic, shooting on the frozen seas north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The cast and production team sailed as far as 81 degrees north to film sequences in the pack ice, the furthest point north it is believed a drama series has ever filmed before.

Based on the acclaimed novel by Ian McGuire, the five-part series tells the story of Patrick Sumner (O’Connell), a disgraced ex-army surgeon who signs up as ship’s doctor on a whaling expedition to the Arctic. But the ferocity of the elements is matched by the violence of his crew mates, with Drax (Farrell), a harpooner and distinctly brutal force of nature. As the true purpose of the expedition becomes clear, confrontation between the two men erupts, taking them on a journey far from solid ground and beyond the safe moorings of civilisation.

Commissioned by the BBC, _The North Water_ is made by See-Saw Films.  Executive producers are Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Iain Canning and Emile Sherman for See-Saw Films, Niv Fichman for Rhombus Media, and  Jo McClellan for the BBC. The series was produced by Kate Ogborn. _The North Water_ is a co-production with Rhombus Media and is distributed internationally  by BBC Studios.

_The North Water_ will air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer this autumn.

**About the panel**

**Andrew Haigh** has written and directed three award-winning feature films:  _Lean on Pete (2017)_, _45 Years (2016)_, and _Weekend_ (2011). _Lean on Pete_ premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2017, while his previous film, _45 Years,_ premiered at Berlinale 2015 where it won Silver Bears for the lead performances of Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay. It went on to win numerous international awards including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and a Bafta nomination for Best British Film. He was also the executive producer and lead writer/director on the HBO show _Looking_ (2013 to 2016).

**Sir Tom Courtenay** is an English actor of stage and screen. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, Courtenay achieved prominence in the 1960s with a series of acclaimed film roles, including _The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner_ for which he received the BAFTA for Most Promising, and _Doctor Zhivago_, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Other notable film roles during this period include _Billy Liar_; _King and Country_, for which he was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival; _King Rat_ and _The Night of the Generals_. For his performance in the film adaptation of _The Dresser_, in which he reprised the role of Norman he originated both on the West End and Broadway, he won the Golden Globe for Best Actor and received both Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. More recently, he received critical acclaim for his performance in Andrew Haigh’s film _45 Years_.

Courtenay has been feted for his work on television also, winning two BAFTA awards for his performances in the television film _A Rather English Marriage_ and the first series of the crime drama _Unforgotten_. Courtenay was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for the miniseries _Little Dorrit_. As well as his competitive honours, Courtenay has been recognised with an honorary doctorate from the University of Hull and, in February 2001, was created a Knight Bachelor for his services for cinema and theatre.

**Jack O’Connell**’s career has catapulted since winning the EE Rising Star Award at the 2015 BAFTA Awards and the New Hollywood Award at the 2015 Hollywood Film Awards and he has fast become one of the UK’s most versatile and exciting actors.

Jack is currently working on _SAS: Rogue Heroes_, a new television drama produced by Kudos for BBC One based on the book by Ben Macintyre which depicts the conception of the famed Special Forces unit. Jack has most recently been seen starring in _Little Fish_ – a film focusing on a young married couple who fight to keep their love alive in the face of a mysterious pandemic that erases people’s memories. 2019 saw the release of Benedict Andrews’ thriller _Seberg_, which received its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival. Max Winkler’s _Jungleland_ was released in 2020 which saw Jack star as bare-knuckle fighter ‘Lion’ alongside Charlie Hunnam as his brother.

Spring 2019 saw Jack star alongside Laura Dern in new feature film _Trial by Fire_, a fact-based drama directed by Ed Zwick. Prior to this, Jack was seen starring alongside Sienna Miller in Tennessee Williams’ Pulitzer Prize winning play _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_. Following his appearance on stage, Jack starred in the original Netflix Western drama series _Godless_, written and directed by Scott Frank and produced with Steven Soderbergh and Casey Silver. 2017 saw O’Connell star as a Czech resistance fighter in _The Man with the Iron Heart_.

**Colin Farrell** has had a distinguished career of nearly 20-plus years in film and television. An accomplished actor recognised the world over, Farrell is currently shooting the MGM film _Thirteen Lives_ for director Ron Howard and wrapped the Warner Bros. and DC Comics’ _The Batman_ for director Matt Reeves in the co-starring role as legendary villain ‘The Penguin’. Farrell can next be seen in A24’s _After Yang_, and this autumn he re-teams with Brendan Gleeson and writer/director Martin McDonagh to shoot _The Banshees of Inisheer_ for Fox Searchlight.

Farrell was most recently seen in Tim Burton’s 2019 live action film _Dumbo_ and Fox’s 2018 ensemble feature _Widows_, directed by Steve McQueen. In 2017, Farrell made his second film with Yorgos Lanthimos, _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ opposite Nicole Kidman for A24. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival along with Sofia Coppola’s _The_ _Beguiled_, in which he also starred with Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, and Kirsten Dunst. That same year, he appeared opposite Denzel Washington in the Sony film _Roman Israel, Esq_., written and directed by Dan Gilroy. Lanthimos’s _The Lobster_, co-starring Rachel Weisz, was Farrell’s first time working with the reputable director. The film won the Jury Prize at the 68th Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a 2016 BAFTA. Farrell was also nominated by the Golden Globes, British Independent Film Awards, and European Film Awards for his performance in the film.

June 2015 marked Farrell’s television debut in the second season of HBO’s _True Detective_. In 2009, he won a Golden Globe for his role in Martin McDonagh’s _In Bruges_. Past work also includes _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_, _Miss Julie_, _Saving Mr. Banks_, _Winter’s Tale_, _Dead_ _Man_ _Down_, _Total Recall_, Peter Weir’s _The Way Back_, _London_ _Boulevard_, _Fright Night_, _Horrible Bosses_, and _Ondine_. Farrell also had memorable roles in _Pride_ _and_ _Glory_, _Miami Vice_, Oliver Stone’s _Alexander_, Terrence Malick’s _The_ _New_ _World_, _Ask the Dust_, _The Recruit_, _A Home at the End of the World_, based on the Michael Cunningham novel, and two of Joel Schumacher’s films, _Phone Booth_ and _Tigerland_. Other notable film credits include _Minority_ _Report_, _Daredevil_, _American Outlaws_, _SWAT_, and _Intermission_.

Born and raised in Castleknock in the Republic of Ireland, Farrell attended the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing starring roles in Deirde Purcell’s miniseries _Falling for a Dancer_, the BBC series _Ballykissangel_, and Tim Roth’s directorial debut, _The War Zone_.
