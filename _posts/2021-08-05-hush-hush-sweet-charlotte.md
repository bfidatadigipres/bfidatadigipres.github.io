Following the unexpected success of _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_ (1962), Robert Aldrich didn’t look far for a follow-up. Henry Farrell, author of the _Baby Jane_ source novel had an unpublished story called ‘What Ever Happened to Cousin Charlotte?’ that screamed out for a reunion of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. In 1964’s _Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte_, Davis plays the title role, no longer so sweet, but a half-deranged ageing belle cooped up in a decaying Louisiana mansion, tormented by a grisly secret from her youth. Olivia de Havilland, who stepped in when Crawford walked out, plays her manipulative cousin Miriam. The cast is swelled by more eye-catching turns: Joseph Cotten, Mary Astor and most memorably of all, Agnes Moorehead as Charlotte’s housekeeper Velma.

It’s high-camp horror in the Southern Gothic vein, with a lurid first-act murder and Davis screeching in a voice that could strip paint, but there’s a certain amount of classiness to proceedings too. Davis is in her element and de Havilland makes for a beautifully clinical villain, although it’s hard not to imagine her predecessor in the role. Aldrich stages some remarkable set pieces, especially the mad scenes and the creepy prologue in which Davis plays the young Charlotte with her face in shadow. An especially eerie later sequence restages that scene, set at a 1920s ball, with all the guests wearing veils and the film overexposed to represent the shimmer of nitrate, or the whiff of  the ethereal.

Seven Oscar nominations, including one for Moorehead and another for Joseph Biroc’s monochrome photography, failed to translate into prizes, but the film remains a much-loved and admired gothic horror. Equipped as it is with mad women, leering tyrants, mysterious drugs, precipitous staircases and a seemingly reanimated corpse, it’s never less than ghoulishly enjoyable.

**Bette Davis on playing Charlotte Hollis**  
The obvious question now was what parts, if any, Bette Davis felt she had had a ball with. ‘I don’t know. None, really, in quite that way. I find playing parts I don’t believe in, parts that have to be played on sheer technique, very difficult, and I do it very badly, so I would never choose a part like that just to relax in.  I really enjoy myself most in the parts l believe in most – Margo Channing, Regina in _The Little Foxes_ – because if I believe in them the rest is relatively easy. Maxine Faulk in _Night of the Iguana_ was a part like that; it really was a ball, because it is at once so funny and so completely true – I think the most complete and believable woman character Tennessee Williams has ever written.’ (Incredibly, it was not written with Bette Davis in mind: she was approached to play Hannah Jelkes, and it was her own idea after reading the script that she should play the other.)

_Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte_, it would seem, has provided her with her least ball-like part of late. ‘The role is a _cheat_,’ she says emphatically. ‘To begin with, it’s the sort of film where you can’t give anything away because everything depends on keeping the audience guessing. The part of Charlotte really has to be played dishonestly, because though she didn’t do the murder and knows that she didn’t, she has to keep doing things in such a way that you think she might have, though there is no reason inherent in her situation in the story why she should. I tell you, it was one of the most difficult parts I have ever played; I just had to try to construct some sort of reality for the character in my own mind so that I could do it at all.’

Though in general she thinks that as a film _Charlotte_ is incomparably better than _Baby Jane_, she regrets _Charlotte_’s deviations from the original conception of Henry Farrell. Apparently the best scenes in the film – hers with Cecil Kellaway, the dinner, and the Mary Astor scenes (‘Didn’t she do them beautifully!’ says Miss Davis with unaffected enthusiasm) – were precisely the ones taken over unchanged from the original treatment.

_Were you pleased with [Davis’] performance in_ Baby Jane _?_

I thought she was wonderful. But I also thought – the public won’t agree, and certainly the critics won’t agree – that the job she did in _Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte_, because it was a much more difficult, narrow-edged part, and took much more talent and time and thought and care, was a better performance than _Baby Jane_, which was such a bravura, all-out Gothic eye-catcher that everybody thought it superior.

_What was the origin of_ Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte _?_

It came from a three- or four-page original idea by Henry Farrell, author of the _Baby Jane_ novel, that I found very exciting. I also wanted to re-team Davis and Crawford. Then Miss Crawford fell ill and was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. And Crawford was sick, seriously sick. If she’d been faking, as some reports then suggested, either the insurance company would never have paid the claim or she would never have been insurable again. Insurance companies here are terribly tough, there’s no such thing as a made-up ailment that they pay you  off on.

Eventually the insurance company offered us the alternatives of finding a replacement for Miss Crawford or scrapping the picture. As you can well imagine, there were great arguments about whom we should get. A number of ladies were considered, all of whom for a variety of reasons were not acceptable to all parties. There was also a contractual problem in that Davis had star approval. Until then it had been academic because she had approved Crawford, but it now became vitally important.

Obviously the ideal candidates would have been Vivien Leigh and Katharine Hepburn. Now it’s not necessary that it should become a matter of public record why Davis didn’t want either of those ladies. It is fair to say however that it had nothing to do with their talent. But there are deep-seated personal and historical reasons why she didn’t want them. I won’t say that Olivia was third choice, but Olivia was the first choice that was acceptable.
