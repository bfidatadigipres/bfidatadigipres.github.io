Morricone grew to resent the focus on his collaboration with Leone, despite his contribution to the ‘Dollars trilogy’ affording him creative freedom. Moreover, it helped shape the tone of the sequels, as Leone played the music on set to guide the actors and achieve the rhythms he would refine while editing.

In many ways, his score for _For a Few Dollars More_ is a variation on the first film’s initiatives, as the pounding timpani, growling guitars and shrill whistling all return. But Morricone made the chanting more guttural and exploited the evocative twang of a jaw harp, the mournful wail of a recorder and the plinking honky tonk of a player piano to counterpoint the sly allusions to J.S. Bach.  He also used a musical box to conjure nostalgia, and church bells and an organ to hint at the story’s spiritual subtext. Most ingeniously, he gave El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) a musical pocket watch, the subtle shifts in tune of which convey the character’s changing mindset.

Most people know that _A Fistful of Dollars_ was based on Kurosawa’s _Yojimbo_, and that _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ is the epic, but this centrepiece of Leone’s ‘Man with No Name’ trilogy was the first spaghetti western to reach for real greatness and become something operatic, psychological and, for a sweet moment in time, _sui generis_. The chiming pocket watch of Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) – whenever its baleful chiming stops, someone dies – could be the template behind Tarantino’s approach to writing dialogue. His dialogue teases and pokes at the viewer in a taunting dance of death; and when it stops,  things happen.  
**Tim Lucas, _Sight & Sound_, February 2013**

‘Well’, says the hunchbacked baddie with a nervous twitch and pop eyes who bears a striking resemblance to a gargoyle on the parapet of Bamberg Cathedral. ‘Well, if it isn’t the smoker ...’ ‘It's a small world,’ grunts Lee Van Cleef in reply. ‘Yes,’ says the hunchback, ‘And very, very ... _bad_.’ It was at this moment during the screening of the rough cut of Sergio Leone’s _For a Few Dollars More_ (1965) that composer Ennio Morricone – normally a restrained sort of person – surprised everyone by exploding with laughter at Klaus Kinski’s performance: over the top, mannered, bizarre, and yet one of the most memorable things about the film.

**A contemporary review**  
In the old days badmen died decently. But in Sergio Leone’s derivative imitation of the American Western the badmen are tortured beforehand and death comes in a leering close-up of a red hole in the head. This is the second in this particular series, and it is possibly even more ostentatiously sadistic than its predecessor, _A Fistful of Dollars_. Clint Eastwood as the laconic stranger, he of the chewed cheroot, well-worn poncho and growth of beard, is here joined by Lee Van Cleef, whose distinguishing characteristics are his ironic smile and his pipe. This, though, is just about the only innovation. As killers, these two are almost supercilious in their professionalism, summed up in the final shot of a wagon-load of victims (who include, incidentally, a pathological murderer and a hunchback). There is no denying that the whole thing is efficiently done; an occasional scene (like the one in which the bounty hunters shoot up each other’s hats) reveals a grain of originality; and Lee Van Cleef’s intelligent performance provides some antidote to the poisonous effect of the bloodletting. The ear-splitting soundtrack seems, in the context, quite appropriate; but the film’s total effect is to leave a sour taste in the mouth.
