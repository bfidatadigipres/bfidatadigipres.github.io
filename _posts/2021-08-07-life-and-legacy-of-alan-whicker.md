**Alan Whicker**<br>
In a late 1950s television climate where a familiar and reassuring face on the British home screen held an unshakeable trust and loyalty with the viewing public, the world of the Englishman’s Englishman as personified by Alan Whicker in far-flung, exotic locales became a source of national pride and celebrity. The Whickeresque glasses, moustache and blazer became instantly recognisable, to the extent that he was called upon to play himself in the film _The Angry Silence_ (d. Guy Green, 1960) and was invited to conduct the first Telstar two-way transmission at the opening of the United Nations Assembly in New York in 1962.

Born in 1921 in Cairo, Egypt, when his ex-Army officer father retired to live there, he returned to England with his mother after his father’s death and was educated at Haberdashers’ Aske’s public school in Hampstead, London. During the Second World War he was commissioned in the Devonshire Regiment (rank of captain) and was seconded to the Army Film and Photographic Unit. After the war, as foreign correspondent with a Fleet Street news agency, he journeyed all over the world and developed a taste for travel. As a war correspondent in Korea in 1950, he went in on the Inchon landings with the U.S. Marines and, it is said, was later reported (with some exaggeration) captured and shot by the North Koreans.

He joined the BBC’s _Tonight_ (1957-65) team in February 1957, appearing nightly in this early and influential current affairs magazine. His filmed interviews were conducted with a noticeable flair and style, and led to the programme’s regular ‘Whicker’s World’ segment in 1958. The transition from short reports to full-length BBC documentaries came with the multi-part, characteristically unconventional observations on Australia (_Whicker Down Under_, 1961), Alaska (_Whicker on Top of the World_, 1962) and the U.S. (_Whicker in the Heart of Texas_, 1963).

He soon progressed from overviews of the more quirkier aspects of other nations’ societies to privileged insights into the more exclusive individuals in world society: _The Solitary Billionaire_ (BBC, tx. 24/2/1963), with J. Paul Getty, _The Model Millionairess_ (BBC, tx. 7/5/1963), with Baroness Fiona Thyssen, and _Matador_ (BBC, tx. 29/7/1966), profiling legendary bull-fighter El Cordobes.

Following the demise of _Tonight_ in 1965, he began _Whicker’s World_ (BBC, 1965-68), a series of highly personalised monthly documentaries which revealed his journalist’s instinct for the most telling and bizarre aspects of a subject. Occasionally, it also offered an unfortunate glimpse of a disquieting impatience with the ordinary person interviewee, where one could almost hear the click as Whicker’s sympathies cut off.

In 1969, for Yorkshire Television (in which he was a major shareholder), he began a memorable period of some of the most fascinating documentaries seen on British television; including the chilling study of Haiti’s dictator Papa Doc Duvalier (_Papa Doc – The Black Sheep_, ITV, tx. 17/6/1969), which went on to win the UCLA’s Dumont International Journalism Award in 1971. Another disconcerting story (which became a special edition) was told in the series _Whicker’s Walkabout_ (ITV, 1970) in Australia, when he entered the ominous, closed-shop union mining community of _Broken Hill – Walled City_ (tx. 25/8/1970). His extraordinary interview with novelist Harold Robbins (_Harold Robbins – I’m the World’s Best Writer_, ITV, tx. 13/7/1971) won the Best Interview Programme Award at the 1973 Hollywood Festival of World Television.

These ITV programmes (including _The World of Whicker_, ITV, 1971-74) also witnessed a mellowing change in the Whicker persona; the one-time slightly censorious, faintly superior character had broadened his sympathies, now less prone to judge, more likely to examine. His travels (socially as well as geographically) continued as before, but seemed destined to retrace steps and themes from past programmes: _Whicker’s Orient_ (ITV, 1972), _Whicker’s South Seas_ (ITV, 1973) and _Whicker Way Out West_ (ITV, 1973).

He returned to the BBC in 1984 and, between further exotic travels, hosted a studio interview series, _Whicker!._ Later on, he was himself the interview subject on various chat shows (with Gloria Hunniford, Richard & Judy, and others), and provided a narrative guide to _The Comedy Map of Britain_ (BBC, 2007-2008).

He was awarded the CBE in 2005 for services to broadcasting. He died in 2013.<br>
