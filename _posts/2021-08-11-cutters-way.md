The mysteries were always there. From the first trance gestures of the opening credits of Ivan Passer’s _Cutter’s Way_, it was clear something special and hypnotic was happening: the slo-mo dance of the Fiesta Peque parade and its flower-festooned Las Señoritas coming directly at us in the hazy Santa Barbara sunshine, the monochromatic image slowly acquiring colour like a blush, the unforgettable Jack Nitzsche score – a ghostly serenade for bells, xylophone and handsaw – strumming up out of the aural ether with a tentativeness suggesting a sense of unease and lostness that would not, in fact, relent in your mind even after the film was through.

Of course, this séance glow has become clear only in rich retrospect, because at first _Cutter’s Way_ was a film no one seemed to get. As with so many films _maudits_, the tribulations of its bad fortune and misrelease seem to reflect its own story arc, as if the movie itself had tried to deliver a secret truth and been suppressed. However, Passer’s atmospheric daydream has a history of being continually rediscovered.

_Cutter’s Way_ is adapted from Newton Thornburg’s 1976 novel _Cutter_ _and Bone_, in which a man drunkenly witnesses a body being dumped, only to find his best friend – Vietnam veteran Cutter – dragging him into a desperate quest to expose the killer. Jockeyed around between studios and victimised by executive turnover – taken up and then dropped by Dustin Hoffman and director Robert Mulligan – the project was eventually shepherded to United Artists by nascent producer Paul R. Gurian, and entrusted to Ivan Passer, the émigré Czech director who had directed _Intimate Lighting_ (1965) and written scripts for Miloš Forman before leaving Prague for Hollywood in the wake of the 1968 Soviet invasion. The studio wanted Bridges as the womanising commitment-phobe Bone, Passer wanted John Heard as the one-eyed, one-legged alcoholic Cutter and Lisa Eichhorn as his soul-wasted wife Mo, and at some point fate smiled and UA suit David Field flipped the green light.

But this was 1980, and apparently no one told anyone involved that the 1970s had ended. With its laser focus on character, evocative capture of grungily specific Americana, implicit sense of class warfare, despairing post-’Nam context and fascinating employment of narrative and visual ellipses, _Cutter and Bone_ (as it was originally titled) was a 70s film from the ground up. Little did we know, one year into the Reagan administration how endangered the sincere, thorny, sometimes haywire but most often scorchingly rigorous movies of the yet-to-be-recognised American New Wave were – or how thoroughly we would come to mourn their dirty cocktail of social protest, youth-culture empowerment, international cinephilia and prole restlessness.

The best of the films from that period still date less than most subsequent Oscar winners, and watching Passer’s film – trailing innocently, almost idealistically, in the wake of the ‘movement’ – can today be akin to watching the great silents of the years 1927 to 1929, which attained transcendence even as talkies prepared to lay waste the medium’s expressiveness. What fascinating, gritty, resonant mysterious concoctions might we have seen in the 1980s, had Spielberg and Lucas not turned the newly matured Hollywood sensibility into an adolescent carnival ride?

Naturally, the ambivalence and grown-up tenor of _Cutter and Bone_ baffled the UA bigwigs, who gave it a modest US release in a few cities; the savaging it received from (among a few other near-sighted critics) _The New York Times_’ shrugging dope Vincent Canby encouraged the studio to pull it after a single week. A week later, other critics delivered hosannas in the national weeklies, and with that encouragement the film was shuttled over to the company’s ‘arthouse’ wing, United Artist Classics, for a second chance, receiving a title change and exposure in stateside festivals.

Critics can rescue films occasionally, just as they can condemn them to the abyss, and the unmarketable nature of _Cutter’s Way_ was as vulnerable as an orchid. Re-released in the summer of 1981, in the lingering dog days of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, _Escape from New York_ and _Arthur_, it vanished again, only to reappear like so many blockbuster-steamrollered small films in the low-grade perpetuity of home video. Its reputation as a new American classic has been slowly escalating ever since.

The American New Wave connection is important, not merely because of the film’s style and pedigree, but because the American 70s were as much about the legacy of _noir_ as they were a gestalt of Euro New Wavism, Cassavetes realism, film-school freedom and Direct Cinema documentary. In the Nixon/’Nam years, realism and salience translated roughly into a new look at _noir_’s expressive capacity for individual doom, self-destruction and surrender to the road, all the chillier for usually being shot in convincing, unrelenting (if overcast) noonlight. _Cutter’s Way_ grabbed this notion by its threadbare lapels – it’s nothing if not a pungent reinvention of _noir_’s fatalism in the hothouse suburban fringes, dazed by the horrifying damage of a new and sickening war.

Poisoned by booze and Lost Generation self-indulgence, the film’s characters are simultaneously iconic and squalidly real, forming a tense sexual triangle of self-destructing tragedy. Without needing to be told, we know these are the end times for this little corner of California. Heard’s Cutter is the troublesome vertex, a raging, childish extrovert on a suicidal tear, almost Wildean in his ornate, allusion-packed speech, but decidedly antisocial – even criminal – in his self-definition. He is the film’s emasculated war ghost, a self-dramatising pest unwanted and ricocheting around in the machinery of the New America like so many antiheroes from 70’s films. It’s part of the story’s brilliance that he tries, rather pathetically, to fill the hole Vietnam has left in him – and in middle America – with an attempt to solve a murder mystery, and an absurd stab at unlikely justice.

Bone, meanwhile, is the America that skated ever the thin ice of the war, clinging to the coattails of the moneyed class and getting by on his charm and cocksmanship, but terrified of commitment to anything; a relationship, a home, a career, a story, a cause. (Bridges’s natural grace and sangfroid ignite a role that could have been dull – just watch him saunter through the ritzy hotel lobby, or wander through other people’s rooms with his belt buckle hanging open.) Bone’s bond with Cutter goes deep enough to be beyond question (we never discover how they met), but now – like the Santa Barbara suburbs we see, houses and cars and neighbourhoods all ageing out and going into disrepair – he faces obsolescence. And so, though he resists the obvious with every fibre of his being, Bone attaches himself to Cutter precisely because of his friend’s reckless sense of all or nothing.

_Cutter’s Way_ may be the best film made about the ripple effect of the Vietnam War on home front doorsteps, and it achieves this largely by way of characters who don’t represent ‘us’, but are fiercely and unquestionably themselves. They are a gift from Thornburg’s book, but as much as Passer’s movie feels novelistic in its weft of themes, it’s also an achievement of textures. Thornburg’s novel may have offered up some of this steak thick dialogue, filthy with unspoken things and half references, but it didn’t have this light and shadow (cinematography by the redoubtable Jordan Cronenweth), this palpable aura of rueful helplessness – and it didn’t have these people, who linger in four dimensions like neighbours we’ve had, with problems we couldn’t help solve.

‘You can assassinate movies as you can assassinate people. I think UA murdered the film,’ Passer told Richard T. Jameson in that same _Film Comment_ piece. ‘Or at least they tried to murder it.’ Tried but failed: Cutter, Bone and Mo would not be forgotten, and _Cutter’s Way_ is still emerging as its decade’s _The Sun Also Rises_, alive and lovely and sorrowful.<br>
