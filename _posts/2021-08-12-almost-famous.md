It’s been four years since Cameron Crowe’s last – and best – film _Jerry Maguire_. But during that period he hasn’t been idle: returning to his journalistic roots, he found time to put together a 370-page book of interviews with Billy Wilder. Like Truffaut’s famous book on Hitchcock, _Conversations with Wilder_ (1999) offers the curious spectacle of an almost painfully sensitive and humane fan bowing down before a filmmaker with a much darker, more bitter sensibility. Perhaps critics who become filmmakers are destined to admire the qualities which they themselves lack. For one can’t help noticing that Wilder’s key virtues – cynicism, satirical bite, economy – are precisely those missing from Crowe’s new film _Almost Famous_.

However, Crowe’s worship of Wilder is still very relevant to a film that both addresses and embodies the idea of fandom. Loosely based on Crowe’s own precocious teenage years – he was a contributor to rock magazine _Rolling Stone_ at 16 – _Almost Famous_ follows 15-year-old journalist William Miller (Patrick Fugit) on tour with the fictional band Stillwater. Just as William is thrilled to fraternise with Stillwater’s cool lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), so for Crowe the film provided an opportunity to hang out with his idols. At 16, Crowe wrote the sleevenotes for Peter Frampton’s hit album _Frampton Comes Alive!_ A quarter of a century later, Frampton returned the favour: credited as a technical consultant, he was responsible for training Crudup and his fellow band members and also has a cameo as the manager of one of his own bands, Humble Pie. It’s tempting to imagine a sequel to _Almost Famous_ in which the grown-up, successful William is able to throw some gainful employment the way of the now rather overlooked Russell.

Like Crowe himself, William feels the need for a mentor. (One of the more interesting revelations in _Conversations with Wilder_ is that Crowe first approached his idol to ask him to appear in _Jerry Maguire_ as veteran sports agent Dicky Fox, whose aphorisms inspire Jerry. Wilder turned down the role, but their meeting led to the interview project.) In _Almost Famous_, the mentor figure is the legendary, real-life rock journalist Lester Bangs, impersonated here by the unstoppably versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman. Bangs’ crucial advice to William, delivered at two separate turning points in the film, is that his writing must be ‘honest and unmerciful’. But this ideal is hard to live up to in the real world. Just as _Jerry Maguire_ lost his job for displaying too much integrity in his mission statement, so William finds his warts-and-all profile of Stillwater spiked by _Rolling Stone_ when the band refuses to confirm his unflatteringly truthful reporting.

I haven’t read Crowe’s music journalism, but on the strength of _Almost Famous_ (and _Conversations with Wilder_, for that matter), ‘unmerciful’ isn’t the first word that springs to mind. And his view of the rock scene circa 1973 seems a lot stronger on nostalgia than on honesty. Certainly, anyone who’s seen Robert Frank’s suppressed documentary _Cocksucker Blues_, which followed the Rolling Stones on a 1972 US tour, will be surprised by the comparative benignity of Crowe’s version. Apart from one scene straight out of _This Is Spinal Tap_, where Russell and Stillwater’s jealous lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) argue about their relative positions on the band’s new t-shirt, these rock stars are remarkably unegotistical and well behaved. The sex is all safely behind closed doors – with William waiting patiently outside in the hotel corridor. Russell does drop acid at a party, but the scene is played for laughs.

Of course, launching a 15-year-old protagonist into a full-on orgy of sex and drugs would inevitably court controversy (not to mention an 18 certificate), and controversy isn’t Crowe’s bag. From his days as a boy journalist Crowe certainly has plenty of first-hand experience of the world he depicts; maybe he really is trying to tell us that the truth was much less extreme than the legend.

This isn’t the only issue Crowe raises, only to shy away from. At the start of the film Bangs warns William that rock ‘n’ roll is over, and the subsequent arrival of a corporate smoothie who takes over Stillwater’s management (and nearly gets them killed when he makes them give up their trusty tour bus for a plane) seems to confirm his doom-laden predictions. But in the film’s closing montage we see Stillwater (still together, despite the rifts of the previous tour) setting off on their 1974 tour, which makes you think 1973 wasn’t the end of an era  after all.

Always a fluent writer of dialogue, Crowe puts some rip-roaring tirades in Bangs’ mouth, delivered with verve by Hoffman. When, near the end of the film, William is stuck writing his Stillwater profile, Bangs reproaches him for getting too close to the musicians, letting them make him feel cool. The point, Bangs insists, is that people like him and William aren’t cool; great art, he continues, is not made by cool people – ‘great art is about guilt and longing.’

Despite personable performances from Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and newcomer Patrick Fugit, these characters have none of the passion and incipient mania that made _Jerry Maguire_ – or John Cusack’s Lloyd Dobler in Crowe’s debut _Say Anything_ – so engaging. At one point William gets angry when Penny describes him as ‘sweet’. But all the characters here are sweet, not least the self-destructive Penny. Crowe’s refusal to call a groupie a groupie (the distinction is that band-aids only give blow-jobs) is symptomatic of a very un-Bangsian excess of mercy towards his characters. Crowe’s most overtly ironic, Wilderesque touch – setting the scene in which Penny has her stomach pumped after an overdose to Stevie Wonder’s sickly-sweet ‘My Cherie Amour’ – makes a traumatic event seem almost inconsequential. And sure enough, Penny is last seen heading for Morocco, happy, smiling and unscarred by her ordeal. In this rock ‘n’ roll circus there are, it seems, no casualties.
