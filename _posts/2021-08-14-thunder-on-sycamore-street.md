_Followed by a discussion with actor Ashley Walters, novelist and screenwriter Stephen S. Thompson, arts producer and TV historian John Wyver, and casting director Carolyn McLeod. Chaired by season curator Burt Caesar._

_Our guest panel will discuss the huge significance of_ Thunder on Sycamore Street _, aided by clips from the TV career of Earl Cameron. We’ll investigate what Cameron’s career tells us about attitudes at the time and how he navigated them, and ask what lessons the contemporary TV industry can take forward._

As well as celebrating one of the truly trailblazing stars of British cinema, the Earl Cameron season, currently playing at BFI Southbank, brings a rare opportunity to catch a powerful rediscovery from the television archives: _Thunder on Sycamore Street_.

The 1957 play, produced by Granada for the anthology strand _Television Playhouse_, was based on an original script by American Reginald Rose – who was more famously the author of  _12 Angry Men_, a play first made for US TV in 1954, three years before Sidney Lumet made his classic film version starring Henry Fonda. With its themes of an individual holding firm against prejudice and outside pressure, _Thunder on Sycamore Street_ makes a fascinating companion piece to Rose’s more famous work. When it was first broadcast on ITV in 1957, it was advertised with a simple but intriguing billing: ‘_Thunder on Sycamore Street_ is an unusual dramatic play.  It shows how the forceful powers of pride and prejudice can drive ordinary suburban people into cruel violence – striking at someone who seems to be unforgivably different.’

The play had originally been produced for CBS’s prestige anthology series _Studio One_ in 1954. Rose pitched a story to the network about a middle-class suburban neighbourhood in which the majority of residents form a mob to force one family from their home. In Rose’s original story the mob comprised a group of white neighbours who threaten to forcefully remove a black family from their home. However, the premise was rejected by US network executives, fearful for their relationship with programme sponsors and anxious that a play confronting racism and integration wouldn’t play to TV audiences in the American south.

The result was that Rose reworked the premise of the play, with the victim of the discrimination becoming a white ex-convict instead of a black man – even if that fact isn’t revealed until late in the drama. The suspenseful structure of Rose’s play allows the audience to guess why the residents of Sycamore Street want their neighbour to leave, and to project whatever assumptions they might have about the prejudices of the day on to the drama. The family in question – the Blakes – are not seen until the third act of the play.

This reworked version of Rose’s play, with the racial discrimination element safely removed, played on US television in 1954, and was then adapted for international broadcasters from countries including Czechoslovakia, Norway, Brazil, Sweden, Hungary, Australia and the Netherlands. (In Britain, the BBC would also produce a version of this reworked play in 1963).  To the best of my knowledge, all of these adaptations retained the alteration that Rose had made for US TV, and had the character of Joseph Blake be a white ex-convict trying to make a life for himself and his family on Sycamore Street, and not a black man facing racial prejudice.

All of which makes Granada’s 1957 British production of _Sycamore Street_ a still more significant production for its times, and an even more important rediscovery from the ITV Archive. For in Granada’s version the Blakes are a black family, with Earl Cameron starring as the father, Joseph Blake. Additional dialogue on the play is credited to the Canadian writer Stanley Mann, and it seems probable that Mann was given permission by Rose to alter his teleplay and revive the writer’s original premise. While the paranoia and intolerance displayed in Rose’s original teleplay chimes with much American drama that was produced in the era of McCarthyism, the Granada version addresses civil rights and racism head-on – a rarity on British television in 1957 and an outright impossibility on US network TV in 1954.

Cameron’s performance as Joseph Blake captures the actor at his most powerful and charismatically magnetic. He vividly portrays Blake’s great anger at the unjust situation he and his family face, in a performance that must have been greatly impactful on contemporary audiences – indeed, it remains so today. He’s ably supported by the Jamaican actress and writer Sylvia Wynter (credited here as Sylvia Winters), playing his wife Anna. Wynter is a remarkable figure herself. Shortly after _Thunder on Sycamore Street_, she worked again with Mann and Cameron on various BBC radio plays, before co-writing _The Big Pride_ (1961), one of the earliest plays by black writers to be produced on British television. Wynter became a justly celebrated writer and academic, so it’s fascinating to see her in a rare early acting role.

Unseen since its original broadcast in October 1957, the play is vital viewing for anyone interested in the history of British and American television. Granada’s production of _Thunder on Sycamore Street_ is also a striking tribute to the talents of Earl Cameron and a pioneering piece of 1950s television drama – an American play that could only be made in Britain.

**About the panel**

**Ashley Walters** has been acting professionally since childhood, winning his first television role in _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_ at the age of 10. His acting career has been varied and prolific across film and television. He is perhaps best known in film for his roles in _Get Rich or Die Tryin’_, and _Bullet Boy_, for which he won a BIFA Best Newcomer Award in 2004, and in television for his starring roles in _Top Boy_ and _Bulletproof_.

‘Asher D’ is also a well-known name in the music industry, where he played a pivotal role in the UK Garage scene in the early 2000s, both within the collective So Solid Crew and through his work as a solo artist. His focus has been on acting in recent years, but last year he signed a worldwide publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music, the music publishing arm of Warner Music. Ashley has recently completed the second instalment of _Top Boy_ for Netflix and Channel 4’s anthology series _I Am..._ starring alongside Suranne Jones. As well as being the lead cast on _Top Boy_, Ashley is the executive producer of the show – a role he will be inhabiting far more in the near future. In 2017 Ashley established his own production company, SLNda, through which he is now producing film and television content that will champion new talent within the UK industry, and better represent the Britain that he sees. In 2021 he made his directorial debut on the short film _Boys_ which premiered on Sky Arts.

**Stephen S. Thompson** is a highly acclaimed novelist and screenwriter of Jamaican descent.  His feature-length single drama _Sitting in Limbo_ was broadcast on BBC1 in June 2020, and won the BAFTA for Best Single Drama. Produced by Left Bank Pictures and directed by Stella Corradi, the _Independent_ called it ‘…a gripping, upsetting and tenderly told dramatic memoir of one man’s ordeal during the Windrush scandal. Its timing could not have been better.’ Next up, Stephen will be adapting his novel _No More Heroes_ also for Left Bank/BBC, developing original crime drama _Buried_ for Me+You/Endeavour Content and an original drama for Keshet. Stephen’s first novel _Toy Soldiers_ was published in 2000 and described by Hanif Kureishi as ‘beautifully written, painfully honest and deeply affecting’. Stephen has also written for _The Observer_,  _The_ _Voice_, _Wasafiri_, _Five Dials_ and _Arena Magazine_. He is the editor and publisher of the online literary journal _The Colverstone Review_, and co-founder of the creative writing retreat, The Page. He has lectured in Creative Writing at Birkbeck College and the University of Edinburgh, and taught screenwriting at Central Film School in London.

**John Wyver** is a writer and producer with Illuminations, specialising in arts documentaries and screen performance. He is Director, Screen Productions for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and he produces their RSC Live from Stratford-upon-Avon broadcasts. He is Professor of the Arts on Screen at the University of Westminster, and his publications include _Vision On: Film, Television and the Arts in Britain_ (2007), _Screening the Royal Shakespeare Company: A Critical History_ (2019) and the forthcoming co-edited collection _Screen Plays: Theatre Plays on British Television_.

Casting for over 15 years, **Carolyn McLeod** is a freelance Casting Director, who specialises in film, theatre, TV and streaming content. She has worked with directors including Paul Schrader, Stephen Herek, Michael Caton-Jones and Sofia Coppola on independent features and numerous projects for Netflix, BBC, Disney, Warner Bros, Hallmark and the Sci-Fi Channel. Recent productions include, _Sweetheart_ for BFI/BBC Films, _Boiling Point_, with Stephen Graham and  _The Princess Switch_ trilogy for Netflix. She is a BAFTA member and is on the board of the European Chapter of the Casting Society of America.

**Chair: Burt Caesar** is a director and an actor in film and in theatre. His acting credits in film include _The Amnesty Files_, _Scoop_, and _Exorcist: The Beginning_, directed by Paul Schrader.  He has directed several film shorts and directed extensively in television drama. Recent TV appearances include in _Unforgotten_ and _Death_ _in Paradise_. He has performed in the West End and on Broadway (_Serious_ _Money_), and at the Royal Court Theatre, National Theatre, Edinburgh Lyceum and Theatre Royal Stratford East amongst others, including in some plays of Shakespeare. He is a former Associate Director at the Royal Court Theatre.

As an educator he has taught/directed at BFI, Rada, Central St Martin’s/UAL, Met Film School, Farnham Film School and elsewhere, plus, in the USA, with Tim Reid’s Legacy Media Institute.
