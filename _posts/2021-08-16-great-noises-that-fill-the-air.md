**Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt**<br>
This was my first film out of film school and it took years to get made. I lived in London but I took a freelance job at Granada TV in Manchester to get to meet John. He once showed me a damp basement full of drafts of his work, which he had constantly refined. He and his friend, the artist Steve Maguire, used to sit working in small notebooks in a pub on the Bury New Road, with Steve sketching the clientele or characters from John’s work. Theirs was a surreal, smoke-filled world reminiscent of the romantic poets. John’s work had been in development for many years but had unexpectedly endowed punk with the fully articulated wit of a performance poet and stand-up comedian.

I was fortunate that Rodney Wilson of Arts Council Films favoured the project and when at last Channel 4 started commissioning, a co-production was agreed. I then needed to find a production company. The first advised that I should be thinking of a series of films but I was indifferent to commercial considerations so I went elsewhere. However, the tight schedule, and the film stock, evaporated all too quickly. By the time the film was made John had moved to Stevenage and was well into a record contract, and ambitious tours like the one featured with Linton Kwesi Johnson were possible. However, this moment also felt like the last chance to make the film. The shades were not just for effect – John has very poor, almost tunnel, vision. He once fell off a stage in Ireland and later stepped out of a train as it waited outside a station. He is also agoraphobic, so touring and performance must have been an ordeal. As for many performers, the crutch of heroin may have seemed something he could control, but it subsequently sidelined his career for years.

Participation of Arts Council Films gave the advantage of distribution to independent cinemas, universities and schools, so it was exciting that the production was for both cinema and television. To balance the dense and rich language, I wanted the film to be visually vibrant, so I worked with cinematographers who were attuned to fiction. All were NFTS graduates and did a great job, as did the sound recordist and editor. I also wanted to disrupt expectations by mixing observational cinema, performance, interview, musical and dramatic elements.

Most of the film was shot around tour dates in Manchester and Sheffield with random interviews with John and Linton arising and tour guests included. Another interview was added during the Hilary Mason shoot in London. In it, John says he is not a confessional poet – he would rather point the finger away from himself. It is difficult to do justice to John but I had hoped to probe his life and development in more depth, including his work alongside Steve Maguire and The Invisible Girls, but the film does provide a broad sketch of a particular moment and was well received.<br>

**Dread Beat and Blood**<br>
My reputation as a poet was built on the publication of my first collection, _Dread Beat An’ Blood_, published in 1975 by Bogle-L’Ouverture, with a generous introduction by my mentor Andrew Salkey, the Jamaican novelist and broadcaster.

I couldn’t believe my luck when, a couple of years later, I was approached by Franco Rosso who wanted to make a film about my work. I didn’t know Franco but I knew of his film about the historic Mangrove Nine trial of Black activists who had organised a campaign against police harassment of the Mangrove restaurant.

Franco’s proposal came at a pivotal time in my life. I was working at the Keskidee Community and Arts Centre in Islington as a librarian and educational resources officer, having just completed a nine-month stint as writer in residence in the London Borough of Lambeth. The timing was as propitious for Franco as it was for me.

As a member of the Race Today Collective and the Black Parents Movement, I was involved in a justice campaign for George Lindo, a Jamaican from Bradford who had been wrongfully convicted of robbery. I was also involved in the occupation of my local youth and community centre in Brixton, which the new warden for the Methodist church was trying to shut down because he resented the autonomy of the youth club members. Moreover, I had signed a deal with Virgin Records and began to record my first reggae album, _Dread Beat An’ Blood_. There was no shortage of material for Franco to film.

By the time the eponymous film was finished, my career as a reggae artist was well on the way. I had hoped that the film would mean extra promotion for the record. Alas, it was not to be, because the scheduled date for the film to be shown on BBC2 was put back by the director general on the grounds that it could be prejudicial against the Tories. ‘It Dread Inna Inglan’, a poem I wrote for the George Lindo campaign, which was featured in the film, made reference to Margaret Thatcher’s racist election campaign remarks. By the time the film was eventually broadcast in 1979, I’d already left Virgin and my second album, _Forces of Victory_, had been released on Island Records. Needless to say, the people responsible for promotions at Island were very pleased that I’d gotten exposure on television. More importantly, the campaign to free George Lindo from prison got national attention.

I once heard my friend, novelist Caryl Phillips, tell an audience that when he was a student at Oxford more than 40 years ago, he came down to London to see the film and realised that he was the only person in the cinema. Since then, _Dread Beat and Blood_ has been broadcast on numerous occasions on a community television channel, I’ve been told, and has now gained a sort of cult status. Along with  _The Mangrove Nine_ (1973) and _Babylon_ (1981), Franco Rosso will be remembered for this film.<br>
