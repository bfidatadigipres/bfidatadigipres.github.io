In between shooting _Once upon a Time in the West_ (1968) and _A Fistful of Dynamite_ (1971), Leone fell in love with a 400-page novel about Jewish gangsters, _The Hoods_. Harry Grey, the author’s pseudonym, himself an ex-gangster, wrote it while doing time in Sing Sing. Leone met him at the end of the Sixties and was intrigued by this ex-hoodlum who responded with monosyllabic answers – ‘Yes, no, maybe’ was all he was able to drag out of him – and represented none of the glory of criminality as depicted by Hollywood, who also shared with him the same imagination, formed in cinema theatres. Leone understood that _The Hoods_ would give him the opportunity to work, not on mythical characters as in his previous work, but on the Myth itself, on its transmission, on film genres and their derivations, on the infancy of the 20th century in a collective Recherche du Temps Perdu.

The construction of this cathedral (as Enrico Medioli called the preparatory work) took a long time. Eleven years passed between the making of _Once upon a Time in America_ and his previous film, _A Fistful of Dynamite_. In an interview, Leone paraphrased Joseph Conrad when joking about the enormous amount of time it took to make the film: ‘I believed it was an adventure. Instead, it was life.’ According to those who collaborated with him between ’67 and ’77, Leone didn’t work on a script, instead the story evolved through infinite oral versions. The cinematographic rights to the novel weren’t initially available and after many fruitless attempts it would eventually be Alberto Grimaldi, the producer of some of Leone’s earlier work, as well as films by Fellini, Pasolini and Bertolucci, who managed to free up the rights and ask Norman Mailer to write a screenplay. Leone didn’t find that first draft interesting and for the rewrite he gathered an extraordinary group of Italian screenwriters around him: Franco Arcalli (Bertolucci’s brilliant collaborator), Enrico Medioli (writer of seven screenplays for Visconti), Leo Benvenuti and Piero De Bernardi (who, in Mario Monicelli’s film _My Friends_, reinterpreted the theme of friendship in an entirely new way). Later on, a young critic named Franco Ferrini joined the group (and, much later, during the final drafting of English language dialogue, Stuart Kaminsky). Medioli said: ‘None of us screenwriters are American, none of us are Jewish, none of us are gangsters. Everything is filtered through the cinema, rather than through literature.’

At the centre of the story are Noodles’ memories, shredded by the effects of opium, saturated with nostalgia, impossible to retell in chronological order, but _Once upon a Time in America_ isn’t a biopic, it is the memory of a man’s life who, for over 30 years, has been examining and re-examining, over and over, his whole existence, specific details and events, obsessively retracing words, gestures, echoes from his past.

The result of this lengthy writing process was a screenplay of almost five hours in length, proving too much for Grimaldi, defeated by his experiences with Bernardo Bertolucci’s _1900_, which had been released in two parts. In 1980, Leone met with Arnon Milchan and Warner Brothers and finally it appeared as though the film was on the verge of being made, also because Robert De Niro had accepted to play Noodles. De Niro offered him the possibility of letting ‘Pinocchio become a real boy’, thereby freeing him from the role of puppeteer and allowing him to become the narrator. The pairing of James Woods and Robert De Niro added an authentic and realistic force to the screenplay, which Leone’s cinema had not previously known.

Leone is the singer of this anthem to the cinema. However – and it goes without saying – if he hadn’t had some of the greatest artists from the golden age of Italian cinema by his side, he would never have been able to create a gem so precious, so richly faceted, so luminous. As in his previous films, Morricone’s soundtrack is in perfect symbiosis with the images, but here, for the first time, it contains some famous songs from the 20th century (as well as Rossini’s _La gazza ladra_) and is an integral part of the narration: it supports the jigsaw puzzle narrative structure, thus allowing us to temporally locate Noodles’ memories. Ennio Morricone already had the soundtrack prepared in the mid-Seventies and during the shoot it was used to inspire the actors, as they did in the silent era. The film was shot over nine months in Paris, Lake Como, New York, Rome, Miami, Venice, New Jersey and Montreal. It was one of the last epics to be shot before the advent of the digital age. Everything we see actually existed in front of the camera. Art director Carlo Simi, costume designer Gabriella Pescucci and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli achieved a miracle of storytelling, recounting three eras with meticulous attention to detail, precision and scrupulous veracity while working between North America  and Europe.

During the advanced editing stages the issue of duration arose: the first version had a running time of four hours and 20 minutes. Milchan and Warner Brothers expected a film of no more than 160 minutes, but Leone had his film in mind. At the end of the struggle the American version, with the scenes re-edited in chronological order and not approved by Leone, lasted 1 hour and 34 minutes, while the European version, presented at Cannes in May 1984, lasted 3 hours and 49 minutes. Several sequences had been eliminated, which, thanks to the stubborn will of the Leone family, the perseverance of The Film Foundation supported by Gucci and the rights owner New Regency, we have been able to find and re-insert where Leone had originally intended them. Beginning and end frames of the cut scenes allowed us to identify the exact place they were deleted from. Leone often recalled many of these scenes with regret, such as the appearance of Louise Fletcher, Oscar winner for _One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest_, as the director of a cemetery, which disappeared from the film along with the scene of Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern) reciting as Cleopatra. This newly reconstructed version lasts 4 hours and 15 minutes.

All the characteristic elements of Sergio Leone’s cinema are to be found in _Once upon a Time in America_: myth, death, friendship, memories, robberies, betrayals, a much anticipated duel, the ‘visual’ presence of the soundtrack, the amazing use of dolly shots and camera movement. However, the film is very different from his previous work: thriller, melodrama, citations from gangster cinema classics, as well as the cinema of Chaplin, Welles and neo-realism all come together in a voyage towards oblivion and death, in which we slowly discover, within this unreal cinematographic grandeur, Noodles’ desperation and anguish. In this circular story, where everything is always postponed and remains inalterable, in an America which is no longer the country where dreams come true, but where power can only ever end up ground to nothing, Noodles is an antihero with the aura of an epic character, an exile that can no longer return home, because home only exists in his memories. Observing happenings from a cosmic perspective, examining his characters with compassion and emotion, once again Leone depicts human myths, but here we also find the miracle and mystery of their existence. De Niro’s memorable ecstatic smile in the film’s finale is a liberating betrayal of cinematic conventions, but it is also a logical conclusion to a film which Leone considered to be ‘a sort of death dance at the birth of a nation… [where] all my characters stare death in the face.’ It was to be the last frame of his cinema. Leone died in 1989, while at home watching Robert Wise’s film _I Want to Live!_
