**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**<br>

Near the conclusion of _Big Wednesday_, an awed young surfer stares out at a fearsome swell – waves like crumbling tower blocks. ‘It’s outrageous,’ he says. Next to him, Bear (Sam Melville), the old timer guru, sets him straight. ‘That’s just the lemon next to the pie. It’s nothing, it’s going to get bigger.’ These words have entered into surfing folklore, words to be rolled around the tongue and savoured as a communal mantra.

The first time we heard them outside of _Big Wednesday_ was on a beach in deepest Cornwall, while taking a crash course in the art of surfing as preparation for writing our film, _Blue Juice_. It didn’t matter that we were wearing chafing wet suits, apparently salvaged from a World War Two diving mission, that our cumbersome boards had all the glamour of a Morris Marina, or even that the surf was barely two feet high. The young surf instructor simply wanted to hear the words, to get the call and response answer from his colleague. That was when we realised that _Big Wednesday_ was more than a portrayal of the surfing culture: it had become part of it.

So what is it about this tale of the golden youth of California that can so affect their pale brethren across the Atlantic so long after its original 1978 release? For a start it is unashamedly epic in scale and heroic in tone. Constructed almost as a modem-day Greek legend, its voiceover immediately delights in introducing us not only to its young heroes but also to a quasi-mythical world in which nature has a godlike power. We could be setting sail with the Argonauts, but instead we are in early 60s California: the young surfers, with their statuesque physiques, enter their arena, the beach, through crumbling temple-like columns.

The score is shamelessly epic, all military brass and kettledrums, sweeping crescendos and pounding new Wagnerian overtures. It’s easy to see the connection between director John Milius’ contribution here and to his work as scriptwriter of _Apocalypse Now_ – the helicopter attack set to _Ride of the Valkyries_ that leads to Robert Duvall’s line, ‘Charlie don’t surf.’ There is also the classic image in the title sequence, the same as that used on the original poster. A man stands on the foreshore clutching an upright board that must reach 16 feet into the sky. The camera pulls back to reveal the waves he faces: waves that dwarf the massive board and leave us to wonder at the foolhardy courage it takes to ride those turbulent waters.

It’s a tale of male bonding and camaraderie. The idea that ‘there’s nothing more important than your friends’ runs like a spine through the film. The female characters remain peripheral to the action, waiting on the sideline as the ‘battles’ are fought. The young men, Jack Barlow (William Katt), Matt Johnson (Jan-Michael Vincent) and Leroy ‘The Masochist’ Smith (Gary Busey) learn lessons from the ‘wise man’, Bear, as they progress towards manhood. They move towards their inevitable date with destiny, the big day that Bear prophesies will come, when the three friends will be able to ‘distinguish themselves’.

While the film’s central concerns (and what still endears it to the worldwide wave-riding community) may be what it takes to be a man – and a heroic surfer man at that – _Big Wednesday_ does not ignore the world outside beach culture. Since the film covers a turbulent decade in American history, the characters’ lives are inevitably affected. But it clings to the idea of the constancy of the unchanging waves at its core. Almost from the beginning, the outside world is portrayed as a dangerous place where the certainties of the ocean no longer apply.

When gatecrashers invade a surfers’ party, the violence that ensues is almost comic book in nature. Despite the flurry of blows, you never believe that anyone is actually hurt. This contrasts starkly with the next sequence, when the three friends head off down Mexico way and start a barroom brawl that explodes into real and fatal violence.

Inevitably, Vietnam, the defining event for the protagonists’ generation, intrudes upon their lives. There is a very funny sequence where the surfers attempt to avoid the draft, but there is also a sense of foreboding as the straight-laced Jack volunteers, and their wastrel friend Waxer is called up. The world outside the beach has taken two of their number and Waxer is never to return.

Matt Johnson becomes a pitiable drunk. Bear succumbs to the ‘American dream’, his board-making shack transformed into a corporate high street venture. The certainty and simplicity of the waves are forgotten for a time and there can be no happiness without them. The voiceover tells us, ‘But now it all seemed behind us. The change wasn’t in the beach, or the rocks, or the waves. It was in the people.’

Eventually, of course, it does all come back to the sea. The prophesied epic swell comes and when Matt walks through those crumbling columns onto the beach, his two boyhood friends are waiting to ‘draw the line’ with him. The final surfing sequence remains the touchstone that all other surfing movies are measured against. The waves are literal monsters: monsters the three friends must meet to assert their manhood. And here is the core idea that explains  _Big Wednesday_’s continued appeal to the very community it portrays, the spine-tingling knowledge that one day there may come a wave that will prove the ultimate test. It not only explains their lifestyle, but validates it.

As one surfing merchandising slogan boasts, ‘only a surfer knows the feeling.’ But this film can take you into the sub-culture, help you understand the joy found in uncertain harmony with nature and even inspire you to plunge into the cold Atlantic, in the thrilling search for your first unsteady upright ride.

But handle it carefully. _Big Wednesday_ has found its way into a lot of people’s blood, even changing lives. How many movies can claim that? I know of at least one ex-London cabbie who never came back, who now sits peering out to sea, mouthing the mantra: ‘That’s just the lemon next to the pie.’<br>
