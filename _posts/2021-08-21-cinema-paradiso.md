Over the years, it became commonplace for Morricone’s scores to be the best thing about a film or programme, whether it was the delicate ‘Chi Mai’ for Jerzy Kawalerowicz’s _Maddalena_ (1971) or the pulsating theme for the 1985 German TV series, _Via Mala_. It was fitting, therefore, that he should be asked to provide the accompaniment for that most glorious celebration of the cinematic snippet, the ‘kiss montage’ in Giuseppe Tornatore’s heartfelt paean to the magic of  the movies.

Echoing the relationship between projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and young film fan Toto (Salvatore Cascio), Morricone wrote the ‘Love Theme’ with his son, Andrea, and its tender strain of melancholic nostalgia captures the essence of both the story and the maverick Morricone’s sometimes overlooked gift for traditional orchestral melody. Tornatore also recruited the composer for _The Legend of 1900_ (1998) and _Malèna_ (2000), which respectively brought a Golden Globe win and another Oscar nomination.

Giuseppe Tornatore’s film is sentimental-romanesque: it begins emblematically with word of a death and a funeral motivating a journey into the past; we then dissolve from present-day Rome, where Salvatore (Jacques Perrin), the middle-aged protagonist, is some undesignated force in the film industry, to the Sicilian village of his birth.

This flashback, beginning during the war, in which the boy’s unseen father is killed, centres on the local picture house, around which Salvatore’s life revolves, and on its projectionist Alfredo, played by Philippe Noiret in a manner worthy of French pre-war character acting. Alfredo is a surrogate parent; and subsequently, after being blinded in a horrific fire, he places his professional mantle, imbued with magic, on Salvatore’s shoulders. Eventually, though, it is Alfredo who persuades Salvatore that he must seek wider horizons.

_Cinema Paradiso_ certainly contains a rich collection of archival snippets, but these do not, save perhaps for a couple of early glimpses of title cards to Renoir and Visconti, evoke an aura of self-congratulatory film buffery. Rather, they interact with Tornatore’s elaborately detailed creation of a world in which everyday life is enhanced by the folklore of the movies.

Thus, the lottery winner, who will later finance the cinema’s rebuilding, reacts to the good news by falling, like a character from René Clair, into a faint; and, to only half-ironic effect, the adolescent Salvatore’s first romance is celebrated with a view of the couple running hand in hand through an immense cornfield – and here, as elsewhere, Ennio Morricone’s bittersweet score contributes substantially to the emotional effect.

More affectingly than did Ettore Scola at the climax of _Splendor_, with its forced invocation of _It’s a Wonderful Life_, Tornatore, who is still in his early thirties and here making only his second feature, establishes a Capraesque fantasy of communal existence. The fantasy, though, is not the whole story: hardship and poverty are not glossed over, and the coda makes it evident that material conditions have changed for the better, even though the abandoned Paradiso is about to be bulldozed into a car park.

The elegiac quality lies not so much in the cinema’s destruction as in Alfredo’s earlier regretful avowal to his departing protégé that ‘Life isn’t like the movies’. Hearteningly, though, _Cinema Paradiso_ itself possesses enough command and self-conviction to demonstrate that movies can still manage to manifest an alternative universe.
