_+ Q&A with cast Suranne Jones and Shaun Evans, and writer and creator Tom Edge. Hosted by broadcaster Edith Bowman._

When a crew member is found dead on board the Trident nuclear submarine HMS Vigil, police in Scotland are called in to investigate. The catch? The UK’s nuclear deterrent must remain unbroken, so the submarine stays on patrol and Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones) must go aboard to begin an investigation. Although the death was written off as an accidental overdose, Amy suspects foul play. But when the crew close ranks in the face of Amy’s questioning, a new threat overshadows her inquiry.

_Vigil_ (6x60’) is made for the BBC by World Productions, the producers of _Line of Duty_, _The Pembrokeshire Murders_, _Save Me_, and _Bodyguard_. Episode one will premiere on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 9pm on Sunday 29 August, with episode two at 9pm on the Bank Holiday Monday, 30 August. _Vigil_ will then continue each Sunday night, with new episodes premiering weekly on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

The fictional series is written and created by Tom Edge, with episodes by Ed Macdonald and Chandni Lakhani, and based on an original idea by George Aza-Selinger. It is directed by James Strong, and Isabelle Sieb. _Vigil_ is produced by Angie Daniell, executive produced by Simon Heath and Jake Lushington for World Productions, Gaynor Holmes for the BBC, James Strong and Tom Edge. _Vigil_ is set and was filmed in Scotland, and is supported by the National Lottery through Screen Scotland. International distribution is handled by ITV Studios.
