Showing the city through a documentary-like lens, the film follows Ricky, an autistic teen who loses himself in New York’s sprawling subway system. Based on true events, the film’s authenticity is leant further weight with the casting of Jesus Sanchez-Velez, an actor with Asperger syndrome who powerfully conveys Ricky’s frustrations at being unable to communicate with the outside world.

**+ Overload**<br>
Winning the Best Animation at the Into Film Awards 2020, this stop motion animation depicts what it feels like to have autism and ride on a busy train.

This is the second of three relaxed screenings presented in response to _The Reason I Jump_, programmed by independent curator, Benjamin Brown.

‘Really, our vision of the world can be incredible, just incredible …’ - Naoki Higashida, _The Reason I Jump_

Whether neuro-diverse or neurotypical, as human beings we are all born with our own unique ways of perceiving the world. However, for many on the autism spectrum, the problem comes when trying to impress that unique perspective onto others through words and gestures. Like a detuned radio, the signal is blocked, coming through only as hissing static.

Channelling several themes explored so effectively by _The Reason I Jump_, the season expresses the key role of the senses in our everyday lives and the transcendent power of nature to provide consolation to the inconsolable. It also conveys the vital importance of giving autistic people a say in how we are treated, and to extend us our rightful seat at society’s table.

As Naoki so poetically puts it, ‘if, by our being here, we could help the people of the world remember what truly matters for the earth, that would give us a quiet pleasure.’<br>
