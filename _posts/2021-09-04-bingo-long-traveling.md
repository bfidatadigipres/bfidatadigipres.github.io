Richard Pryor joins an all-star cast in this Motown Productions’ charmer set in the waning days of baseball’s segregated Negro League. Billy Dee Williams stars as Bingo Long, a born showman, loosely based on Satchel Paige. Pryor plays Carlos Nevada, a player working on his Spanish in the hopes of passing as Latino for a place in the all-white Major League.<br>

**A Contemporary Review**<br>
In his frenzied assault on the cinema, Motown’s Berry Gordy has hitherto (_Lady Sings the Blues, Mahogany_) been dogged by disastrous scripts, bad direction and a schizophrenic attempt to sell the new black consciousness in time-honoured dream factory wrappings.

With a sharpish and skeptically witty script by Barwood and Robbins (who wrote _The Sugarland Express_) from a factually-based novel, apparently sidestepping racial issues but in fact quietly probing away at old sores in the unforced irony with which it observes how easily the Negro could be conned into making his way in a white world simply by shedding his dignity and becoming a clown, _Bingo Long_ goes some way toward resolving two of these difficulties.

It also boasts some marvellous locations in the back-woods of Georgia, a whole flurry of fine performances (notably from Richard Pryor as an All-Star obsessed by the possibility of infiltrating the white teams as a Red Indian or a Cuban), and several very funny scenes (the best probably being one in which Billy Dee Williams, intent on stealing a car from under the sheriff’s nose and airily using the silver paper from a stick of chewing-gum to turn on the ignition, somehow gets his connections mixed and is rewarded by Shirley Temple and ‘The Good Ship Lollipop’ blaring from the radio).<br>
