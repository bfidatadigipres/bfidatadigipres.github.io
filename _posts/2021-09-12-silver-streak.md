Set on a train from Los Angeles to Chicago, Silver Streak marks Pryor’s first collaboration with his frequent co-star Gene Wilder. The film mixes romance, comedy, caper, and big-budget action, and set the template for a generation of genre-bending buddy movies, with Wilder and Pryor’s chemistry creating the gold standard.<br>

The cage that trapped Richard Pryor in many of his films of the early 1980s was due in part to the unexpected popularity he stumbled into with the buddy comedy _Silver Streak_ (1976), starring Gene Wilder, which in turn led to the screwball comedy _Stir Crazy_ (1980, also with Wilder). Stealing the spotlight in _Silver_ _Streak_ from his co-star, Pryor mesmerised a mainstream white audience who wanted to see more of him. The problem, of course, was that Hollywood never really knew how best to harness his talent – all they knew was that he could make people laugh, without understanding the how or why of where the laughter originated. As a result, much of the audience who went to see _Stir Crazy_ or _Brewster’s Millions_ (1985) only knew one version of him, and it was definitely not the version who recorded _That Nigger’s Crazy_. Audiences watching _The Toy_ (1982) saw the Pryor who made them laugh by simply being silly, whereas the Pryor who performed stand-up made people laugh by exposing his torment. And the only time that torment ever came through in his work outside of stand-up comedy was in his dramatic performances.<br>
