**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

Alexander Korda had something of a genius for teaming up creative personnel. Having matched Michael Powell with Emeric Pressburger, he then introduced Graham Greene to Carol Reed. The director, who had just quit Rank after being subjected to penny-pinching quibbles over _Odd Man Out_ (1947), was delighted by the idea; he and Greene had admired each other’s work for years, though they’d never met. The rapport was immediate. Greene later described Reed as ‘the only director, really, that I’ve enjoyed working with.’ He particularly enjoyed their first collaboration, _The Fallen Idol_ (1948), saying it was ‘more a writer’s film than a director’s.’

Even so, Greene initially thought that the short story Korda had chosen for adaptation, ‘The Basement Room’, was unfilmable, since it included ‘a murder committed by the most sympathetic character and an unhappy ending.’ Reed persuaded him that the outcome could be changed and Greene happily went along with the alteration. Which is odd, since it’s the ending of _The Fallen Idol_ (a title, incidentally, chosen by the distributor and loathed by Greene) that rings most false.

The centrepiece of the great trio of films directed by Reed at the height of his career, _The Fallen Idol_ has suffered neglect in recent years, its quiet murmur drowned out by the melodramatic reverberations of its predecessor and successor, _Odd Man Out_ and _The Third Man_ (1949). The other two are both public films, each played out in full view on the stage of a politically divided city, and photographed by Robert Krasker, master of skewed angles and dramatic shadows. By comparison, _The Fallen Idol_, shot by the cooler, more fluid Georges Perinal, is chamber-music filmmaking scaled to a domestic arena.

Exterior locations apart, almost all the film is set in the formal, comfortless expanses of a huge London embassy. Reed makes masterly use of this vertiginous space right from the opening: the ambassador’s neglected eight-year-old son, Felipe, peers down from the uppermost landing at the servants as they are presided over by the boy’s idol, Baines the butler, and move like chess pieces over the checkered hallway below. Staircases – the grandiose double curve of the interior, the jagged outside fire-escape, the intimate basement stairway leading down to Baines’ pantry – define the film’s emotional boundaries, offering vantage points for spying eyes but also unreliable perspectives. When Felipe, fleeing in panic from the confrontation between Baines and his shrewish wife, scrambles down the fire-escape, his intermittent glimpses from outside as he passes each window lead him crucially to misread the sequence of events.

This key scene encapsulates the film’s themes of secrets and lies, perception, loyalty and betrayal. Alert to everything around him, Felipe lacks the emotional maturity to make sense of events; he sees what’s going on, but misinterprets its meaning. And the lies he tells, intended to protect Baines, only serve to deepen the suspicions of the police. Greene said: ‘The subject no longer concerned a small boy who unwittingly betrayed his best friend to the police, but dealt instead with a small boy who believed that his friend was a murderer and nearly procured his arrest by telling lies in his defence.’

It’s interesting that Greene misremembers his own story. In ‘The Basement Room’ his young protagonist, tired of all the lies and secrets, deliberately betrays his friend. ‘He was going to finish once and for all with everything, with Baines and Mrs Baines and the grown-up life beyond him.’ By doing so, Greene implies, he blights his own life for ever, ‘extricat[ing] himself from life, from love, from Baines with a merciless egotism.’ Such a devastating conclusion might indeed have been too much for cinema audiences. But the alternative tragic irony towards which the film’s narrative logic seems to be heading – Baines arrested for murder as a result of the boy’s well-meant lies – would surely have worked better than the fudge we get. The police decide much too readily, on the basis of one ambiguous piece of evidence, that Baines is innocent and dismiss Felipe’s testimony out of hand.

This let-down may explain why _The Fallen Idol_ has never stood as high in critical esteem as _Odd Man Out_ or _The Third Man_. But up to that point _Idol_ is a supremely controlled piece of filmmaking that not even William Alwyn’s heavy-handed score can disrupt. Above all, it shows Reed’s consummate skill as a director of actors. Michael Redgrave described him as ‘the gentlest of directors ... able, with infinite pains and care, to bestow on his actors the feeling that everything was up to them and that all he was doing was to make sure that they were seen to their best advantage.’ His direction of Ralph Richardson and the young Bobby Henrey (who had never acted before) has been rightly praised, but his handling of Sonia Dresdel as Mrs Baines is almost more remarkable, bringing out the desperate loneliness beneath her spite, the frustration of a woman whose husband has long since abandoned her for his private fantasy world.

**Carol Reed: 1906-1976**  
Born in Putney, the illegitimate son of actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Carol Reed entered the acting profession in 1924. After working as assistant to crime novelist Edgar Wallace at British Lion, he moved in 1932 to Ealing Studios, where he directed his debut feature _Midshipman Easy_ in 1935.

Versatile and unfailingly workmanlike, Reed went on to make a mixed bag of movies, which ranged from social drama (_Bank_ _Holiday_, 1938) to screwball comedy (_Climbing_ _High_, 1939). His first major film, _The Stars Look Down_ (1939), adapted from a novel by A.J. Cronin, brought grim documentary authenticity to its pit-head scenes. Having established himself as a major figure in the British film industry, Reed then directed one of the best wartime propaganda films, _The Way Ahead_ (1944).

After the war he hit his stride with a trio of films – _Odd Man Out_ (1947),  _The_ _Fallen_ _Idol_ (1948) and _The_ _Third_ _Man_ (1949) that earned him the status of Britain’s finest director. But then he seemed to lose his way. A Conrad adaptation, _Outcast of the Islands_ (1951), proved a disappointment, and  _The_ _Man Between_ (1953) felt like a tired retread of _The Third Man_.

The rest of his career represented a sad decline, with sentimental whimsy  (_A Kid for Two Farthings_, 1954) and routine thrillers (_The Running Man_, 1963) interspersed with overblown international tosh (_Trapeze_, 1956; _The Agony and the Ecstasy_, 1965). Only twice was there something of a return to form:  _Our Man in Havana_ (1959) reunited Reed with Graham Greene in a stylish, sardonic spy comedy; and a stack of Academy Awards, including a best-director Oscar, greeted _Oliver!_ (1968).
