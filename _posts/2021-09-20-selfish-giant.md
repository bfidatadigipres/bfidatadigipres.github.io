_+ Q&A with director Clio Barnard_

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Clio Barnard’s _The Selfish Giant_ bears a tenuous relation to the Oscar Wilde children’s story that inspired it – so tenuous that the director admits she thought of changing the title entirely. The giant of her story is the exploitative and potentially violent scrap dealer Kitten – who at one point threatens to put teenager Arbor’s arm through a wire stripper – and his garden is the scrapyard, a field of recycled, often stolen, metal.

Kitten’s yard embodies the malaise of a dismantled industrial society in which nothing new is made but everything is available to be picked, stolen, scavenged: a selfish economy in which everything is potentially worth a bob or two (the theme gets a sourly comic spin when the father of Arbor’s best friend Swifty sells his sofa from right under his numerous children).

Thankfully, Wilde’s mawkish tale of renewal and redemption doesn’t haunt the film too obviously, although elements echo faintly. The Christ Child who haunts the Giant’s garden, with stigmata on his hands and feet, here becomes the martyred Swifty, whose death prompts Kitten to hand himself over to the police. It’s arguably only the residual trace of the Wilde story that entirely makes sense of Kitten’s surprisingly sudden and open redemption.

But _The Selfish Giant_ isn’t best approached as an experiment in recycling a familiar text (narrative scavenging, as it were). The film is a return to the Bradford setting of Barnard’s debut feature _The Arbor_ (2010), in which actors lip-synched to documentary testimonies about local playwright Andrea Dunbar.

Despite its reworking of an incongruous pre-text, however, _The Selfish Giant_ shares little of _The Arbor_’s overtly experimental motivation. Instead, this essay in lyrical realism belongs in a very familiar British tradition that connects such films as _Kes_ (1969), _Ratcatcher_ (1999), _Sweet Sixteen_ (2002) and _Fish Tank_ (2009) – depictions of the immediate conditions of social deprivation from the point of view of children and teenagers.

Having chosen to pitch her stall this time directly on the royal road of British art cinema, Barnard nevertheless brings a distinctive poetic spin to her material, making the film as much a study of the porous boundary between town and country as _Kes_ was. There’s a strikingly eerie ruralist magic to the repeated shots of horses standing on horizons at night – Barnard and DP Mike Eley make strong, often stylised use of horizontals, including the frame of the bed that Arbor sometimes hides under (his own arbour, perhaps?). There’s an extraordinary shot late in the film of a landscape that bears the marks of post-industrial disuse, the land and vegetation taking on the look of fatigued, rusted metal, evocative of the inert mineralisation afflicting a world once organic.

The organic forces in the film (in the terms of Wilde’s story, the endurance of irrepressible life to make England’s dead garden bloom) are represented by the two boys and by Kitten’s horse Diesel. The racing with traps, or two-wheeled ‘sulkies’, is a phenomenon that will be familiar to viewers of the underrated _Eden Valley_ (1995), by the Newcastle-based Amber Collective. In Barnard’s film the theme provides an almost autonomous sequence of explosive energy, in which sulkies race down the road followed by a flotilla of trucks carrying cheering spectators.

As for the film’s two young leads, their relationship – a little-and-large duo echoing _Of Mice and Men_, although the ostracised Swifty is more astute than his persecutors think – is the core of compassion and solidarity in a harsh world. Sentiment only creeps in at the very last moment, in a shot in which the dead Swifty seemingly reappears to clasp hands with Arbor under his bed, but otherwise the rapport between the two boys has a boisterous, prosaic ease.

Like Billy Casper in _Kes_, Arbor embodies the capacity of the young soul to endure society’s best attempts to crush it – and seeing him shin up a lamp post carries echoes of Billy’s scrawny athleticism in the Loach film. The school here may not be as mechanically soul-destroying as Billy’s, but for all the liberalism it espouses there’s an antiseptic, bureaucratic deadness about its shiny corridors, while cheerful placards in the classroom urging ‘Be Positive’ come across as empty sloganeering. And the school does, after all, entirely give up on the boys.

Conner Chapman and Shaun Thomas are terrific fresh finds for Barnard, and the film is a triumph in the direction of young untried actors. Thomas’s less demonstrative role shouldn’t blind us to the depth of emotive power that he finds in the quietly tenacious, ethically stalwart Swifty, while Chapman is one of those force-of-nature young talents (as David Bradley was in _Kes_, and Katie Jarvis in _Fish Tank_) who seem to find their personal apotheosis in one perfect role, whether or not they have screen futures ahead of them.

Arbor’s perfect, irrepressible defiance emerges in a superb moment in which this pugnacious shrimp of a lad, possibly destined for a successful entrepreneurial career on one side of the law or another, welcomes police officers to his house with a peremptory bark of ‘Shoes – off!’<br>
**Jonathan Romney, _Sight & Sound_, November 2013**

The key to Clio Barnard’s work is a radical pursuit of truth, by whatever means necessary. In the ground-shifting documentary _The Arbor_ (2010), about the young playwright Andrea Dunbar, she had actors lip-sync to real-life testimony. In _The Selfish Giant_, the drama grew out of the meticulous documenting of a teenager’s life in the  underbelly of a Bradford estate. Both films are inspired  by spirited lives lived in dispiriting circumstances. As  a director, Barnard brings a fresh sensibility to British  Loachian social realism: _The Selfish Giant_ is not merely  kitchen sink drama but an examination of the foul smelling, leaky plumbing beneath. While a harrowing picture of Britain’s lost underclass, the film also  celebrates the funny, lunatic energy of a friendship between two 13-year-old boys, and their entrepreneurial  entry into the scrap metal business.

Perhaps because Yorkshire-raised Barnard comes from an artist filmmaker background – her earlier shorts were shown at London’s Tate Modern and New York’s MoMA – her Northern grit is delivered in an often elegiac and exquisitely photographed package. In _The Selfish Giant_, the moors beyond Bradford’s Buttershaw Estate are populated by wild horses and dark, satanic pylons looming in the dusk. The film shows none of the wobbles of a first feature. At 48, Barnard seems to have landed here, fully formed as a filmmaker: _The Arbor_ won awards at the BIFAs and the BFI London Film Festival, while _The Selfish Giant_ played to critical acclaim in the Directors’ Fortnight section at this year’s [2013] Cannes.<br>
