_Introduced by Jason Morell, actor and son of Joan Greenwood_

In a denouement befitting these times, the last act of _Flesh and Blood_ sees Charles Cameron (Todd) fight a deadly epidemic. Based on a stage play exploring ideas of heredity by Hitchcock collaborator James Bridie, the film takes us through three generations of a family beset by illness and poverty, eventually proving that genius will out. One of those generations takes the form of Joan Greenwood (whose centenary was earlier this year) as the ruthless daughter of an alcoholic consumptive (also Todd). Though slightly hampered by its theatrical origins and intricate plot, the film features some excellent performances, especially from Greenwood and her future husband  
André Morell.

**Joan Greenwood**

The irresistible leading lady of some of the most enduring British films, seductive of voice, face and figure, searching the language – and indeed the world – for booby traps, Joan Greenwood’s performance record must be nearly unrivalled among British leading ladies. RADA-trained and on stage from 1938 (delectably malicious as Hattie in _The Grass Is Greener_, 1959; sharply ambiguous in _The Chalk Garden_, 1971), she was in films from 1940.

She was one of _The Gentle Sex_ (1943) celebrated in Leslie Howard’s film, was a sympathetic helper for _The October Man_ (d. Roy Ward Baker, 1947), and a doomed Sophie Dorothea in _Saraband for Dead Lovers_ (d. Basil Dearden, 1948), but it was as the female lead in a series of benchmark comedies that she made herself indispensable to British films.

In _Whisky Galore!_ (d. Alexander Mackendrick, 1949) and _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ (d. Robert Hamer, 1949), she is the drily beguiling Peggy and the wonderfully minxish Sibella respectively; she deflects Alec Guinness from his experiments in _The Man in the White Suit_ (d. Alexander Mackendrick, 1951) and she is, in her way, as imperishably Gwendolyn as Edith Evans is Lady Bracknell in _The Importance of Being Earnest_ (d. Anthony Asquith, 1951).

She did better in America than some of her contemporaries (cf. _Moonfleet_, d. Fritz Lang, 1955, and _Stage Struck_, d. Sidney Lumet, 1958). She played character roles back in Britain but remained a star until the end, which came after _Little Dorrit_ (d. Christine Edzard, 1988), as Mrs Clennam, and it was good to see her brilliant at the finish. There was some TV and stage work but she is above all a British _film_ star, the genuine article.

**From the archives: a 1956 profile of Joan Greenwood**

It is less than a year since _Moonfleet_; and already one misses her.  The Hollywood journey, besides, had been preceded by one to Paris, where she appeared as a cat-burglar in a minor film with Bourvil. It seems that the British cinema, which developed her, is in danger of losing this extraordinary actress; but she is the kind of exquisite, idiosyncratic luxury that it can ill afford to lose.

First of all, Joan Greenwood demands a surrender to personality. Her use of deliberate ironic mannerism, her method of speaking lines of dialogue as if, as one critic has remarked, ‘she dimly suspected some hidden menace in them’, reflects a nature which can best be described as beautifully eccentric.  The eccentricity is not wholly of our time, and for this reason it flowered most fully in _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ and _Father Brown_ (the latter, though technically present-day, seemed really to be masquerading in modern dress). Her work with Robert Hamer brought out a _fin-de-siècle_ perverseness and elegance, a joy in the refined but outrageous gesture; and in her feline, purring yet deadly Sybilla, her playful widowed Lady Warren (she must have poisoned Lord Warren, one thought immediately), there was a suggestion of the leisure, the _outré_ sophistication of another age. The same love of the deliciously freakish links two other performances with these: her Gwendolen in Anthony Asquith’s adaptation of _The Importance of Being Earnest_, supercilious, wickedly affected – above all in her display of lorgnette, and her insolent filling of Cecily Cardew’s cup of tea with innumerable lumps of sugar – and her  Lady Clarissa, the drawling, mocking but somehow formidable villainess  of _Moonfleet_.

Yet this is not the whole truth. Though the extraordinariness is always there, in the quizzical scoop of the voice and the faintly derisive air of astonishment at wherever – and with whoever – she happens to be, she is by no means as limited an actress as one might expect. Coming down to earth, she knows at once, really, where she is. Her Scots girl in _Whisky Galore!_, her industrialist’s daughter in _The Man in the White Suit_, her suburban girl in _Knave of Hearts_, were all genuinely felt and observed creations. Whether slanted to comedy (the delicious moment in _Whisky Galore!_ when she refuses to admit the customs officials in the middle of the night with the simple announcement, ‘Post Office is closed’) or to drama (the beautifully played scene with Gérard Philipe in _Knave of Hearts_ when she suspects he is going to desert her), they have a subtle individual truth. And they are never simple: the reward, perhaps, of the eccentric’s temperament.

Now that costume pictures are out of fashion, it may be a long time again before we see her superbly frilled, parasolled and hatted, moving through a comedy of manners with that perfect, ruthless fastidiousness. But the contemporary scene also has need of her, with her special, unexpected intuitions of character, and it would be sad if she were lost to the stage. (Devotees, incidentally, may remember her in 1939 as Little Mary in  _The Women_.) No doubt she was delightful on Broadway in _The Confidential Clerk_; certainly she was in London during the time she played in _Bell Book and Candle_. This was a comedy in which she was cast as a witch – and there was another, never brought to the West End, in which she changed into a cat…  And this, of course, is the alarming thing. Whenever she has been absent for some time, the element of fantastic speculation enters in and strange visions fill the mind; the actress may be holidaying on a broomstick, or relaxing as a lovely blue-point Siamese in some adoring, enslaved household, or, having simply played a Dunne-like trick of time upon herself, be enjoying a characteristic foray in some vanished elegant society. One knows she will come back, because she can obviously manage this kind of thing with ease. But one hopes it will be soon.
