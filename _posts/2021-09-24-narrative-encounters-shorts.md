This programme highlights the work of a diverse group of filmmakers at different stages in their careers, who all have a singular approach to questions that are at once political, intimate and formal. From the humorous to the somewhat tragic, these films offer a glimpse into the distinct cinematic preoccupations of some of the most promising voices in Arab cinema today.

**The Trap**  
Away from preying eyes, a young unmarried couple retreat to the depth of a desolate run-down Egyptian seaside resort, to make love. The power dynamic between them is tested, when the girl reveals she wants their relationship  to end.

**I Am Afraid to Forget Your Face**  
After being separated for 82 days, Adam travels down a rough road to be reunited with the one he loves, whatever it takes.

**Aziza**  
This short film follows a newly displaced Syrian couple’s drive around Beirut, which then morphs into a hallucinatory and nostalgic trip.

**The**  **Bath**  
When his wife leaves on a business trip, Imed must take care of his 5-year-old son, Hedi, for the first time on his own. While his wife has always taken care of their child’s daily needs, Imed ends up enjoying this privileged time with his son, even after showing a little resistance. However, this common and simple event in a family’s life unearths dark memories from Imed’s past. Little by little, Imed is paralysed with anguish from the most trivial moments, forcing him to lead an unceasing double struggle – against his resurging fears and dire need to hide his turmoil from everyone and especially young Hedi.

**Drought**  
In this erotically charged drama by Lebanese filmmaker Remi Itani, a real estate agent begins to close the gap between her private experiences in a series of empty apartments and the very different life she leads in public.

**Maradona’s Legs**  
During the 1990 World Cup, two young Palestinian boys are looking for ‘Maradona’s legs’; the last missing sticker that they need in order to complete their world cup album and win a free Atari.
