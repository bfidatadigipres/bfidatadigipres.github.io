There is nothing quite like English suburbia, and a solid tradition of literary commentators, from Arnold Bennett to William Cooper, has ventured down the tree-lined avenues to unmask the mysteries of life behind the chintz curtains. Film attitudes to suburban life have ranged from that quintessentially British stance of bemused tolerance (possession is nine-tenths of happiness) to vituperative, and sometimes intolerant, rejection of all those lovingly sustained semi-detached values, a critical line extending from the generalised hostility of _Look Back in Anger_ to the particular commitment of _Family Life_. In Mike Leigh’s _Bleak Moments_, which seldom ventures beyond the dowdy claustrophobia of red brick and brown sofas, suburbia is hell on earth.

In this case, hell is more than other people, it’s other people because of and in spite of oneself. At first glance Sylvia (Anne Raitt), around whom the other characters pivot but with whom they don’t begin to connect, seems well enough equipped to cope with whatever the world has to offer. She is attractive, intelligent, and graced with an appealing if bizarre sense of humour which is as often as not directed against herself; she is also endowed with an enviable tolerance of other people’s idiosyncrasies, which extends even to her typist colleague and limpet-like friend Pat (Joolia Cappleman), one of those archetypal permanent spinsters whose untoned cheerfulness and ubiquitous knitting are an unspoken admission that opportunity has passed her by.  In _Bleak Moments_, though, appearances are never deceptive. Everyone Sylvia encounters in this cramped stretch of South London is a victim of himself, trapped by circumstances like most people but also self-immured from the world outside by the unwished for agonies of the space between words.

Sylvia herself is inextricably bound by and to Hilda, her 29-year-old sister whom brain damage has imprisoned in permanent childhood; Pat, who hangs round Sylvia like a clinging vine, has befriended Hilda, but perhaps only because she sees in this mute surrogate child a welcome release from her own querulous, bedridden mother and such irritations as a set of false teeth left in a glass for visitors to remark. The film quietly, patiently documents this seemingly permanent impasse while recording Sylvia’s attempt to break down the barriers of her circumscribed environment, first with Peter (Eric Allen), a paralytically diffident schoolteacher, and intermittently, when Peter advances in retreat, with Norman (Mike Bradwell), a shambling, nervous drifter who camps in her garage to operate a duplicating machine for a magazine run by his friends. Sylvia’s protracted encounters with these two paragons of non-communication add up to a depressing spectacle of the danger zones of human relationships.

But it’s not entirely a catalogue of depression. Mike Leigh leavens the general gloom (pervasive enough to make an audience despair of the characters as much as they despair of each other) with a layer of sidelong humour which shows through almost in spite of itself. In this, his method obviously recalls both Olmi and Forman, especially in the almost methodical way he builds a scene to a crashing anti-climax. Like these masters of observational cinema, Leigh records human eccentricity from a point of view that is critical perhaps (it is their inability to meet society’s expectations of them as much as their failure to break free of their own constraints which makes these characters what they are) but never jaundiced. In this sense Leigh is nearer to Olmi, and particularly the Olmi of _Il posto_ and _I fidanzati_, than to Forman, since there is hardly a suggestion that his viewpoint is ambiguous or detached; though he shares with Forman the capacity to make us laugh at the weaknesses of others while being pulled up by an uncomfortable realisation that their frailties are only our own writ large.

Far from being sociological types of human behaviour (perennial stumbling block of British realist cinema), these people are also recognisable for what they are in their own right. Sylvia, for instance, has a way of sidling into a conversation with a totally disconnected, anarchic remark, which is both surprising and consistent with her own interior conflict – the familiar nervous, well-meaning ploy of channelling aggression through other people. Wake up and I will wake up is what she is desperately trying to say. Engaging battle with Norman, she quietly remarks that she is ‘the President of Venezuela’, which prompts him to an admission that he is not from Doncaster but from Scunthorpe, an exchange encapsulating the whole web of class consciousness which has previously (though never of course in so many words) enmeshed their relationship. For an instant, the barriers are down, a victory achieved by Sylvia’s anxious but resolute determination to assert herself; the next moment they are up again, the tide breaking through a wall of sand as Pat, who lives for other people’s birthday cards, blurts out a request for Norman to strum a song they can all join in.

The highlight, if that is the word, of the film’s observation of this war of nerves is Sylvia’s confrontation (and that is the word) with Peter, whose own bottled aggression is characterised in maybe the film’s one unsympathetic moment when he stumbles through McLuhan’s theory of communication. ‘I find it easier watching radio,’ Sylvia counters to his frustratingly irrelevant question about the relative merits of radio and television. There is one scene, a disastrous dinner in an almost deserted Chinese restaurant with a supercilious waiter dancing non-attendance, which is pure Olmi, even to the long shot isolating the two of them against a forest of tablecloths. And when Sylvia takes her feckless suitor home to ply him with sherry and finally ask him point-blank to drop his trousers, Leigh’s patient, almost immaculately classical editing communicates the embarrassment with a familiarity which makes one shift nervously in one’s seat.

_Bleak Moments_ is perhaps a little too long and in a sense trapped by its own claustrophobia, in that what one misses is a counterpoint with the world outside; Leigh’s theatre background may account for this. But as a first film it is an entirely original and (yes) highly promising work, shot in appropriately muted colour by Bahram Manoochehri. It was made, amazingly, for about £18,000, and shot at a 7:1 ratio. Suffice it to say that this only goes to demonstrate what you can do if you want to.<br>
