One of those rare B-movies that manages to live up to or even exceed the lurid promise of its title and poster. It finds an (American) London cabbie on a dangerous mission to rescue an innocent French girl tricked into prostitution, and also packs in Herbert Lom as a murderous pimp, Man Ray-style dream sequences and the first onscreen appearance of Michael Caine and Anne Reid (in a registry scene). Highly entertaining Soho hokum.<br>
**Edgar Wright**

Opening with a solemn introduction by Inspector Robert Fabian (of _Fabian of the Yard_ fame) in which he expresses his disgust at the rise of organised prostitution rackets, or ‘the white slave trade’, _Passport to Shame_ is in fact a typical piece of 1950s (s)exploitation, claiming to expose a pressing social evil while rarely missing an opportunity to show ‘guest star’ Diana Dors parading in basque and suspenders.

She plays prostitute Vicki, trying to raise enough money to pay hospital bills for her sister Maria, scarred for life in an acid attack by the vicious Nick Biaggi (Herbert Lom), a dapper gangster whose surname hints at the Italian and Maltese dominance of the Soho sex trade of the time. Shortly after the film was released, the 1959 Street Offences Act attempted a crackdown on street prostitution, but this had hardly any effect on operations like Nick’s, where the prettiest girls would be ‘groomed’ to service high-profile clients behind the scenes.

Malou (Odile Versois) is doubly trapped: wanted by the police in France for (framed) theft, her arranged marriage lets her work legally, but also makes her wholly dependent on her new masters. Depressingly, the mechanics of her enslavement are virtually identical to the scenario depicted in Lukas Moodysson’s _Lilja 4-Ever_ (2002), suggesting that little has changed in nearly half a century.

This was Canadian-born Alvin Rakoff’s first cinema feature after a few years in television. His treatment is broadly realistic, with the occasional Expressionist flourish, notably a startling dream sequence that anticipates the much later _Repulsion_ (1965) in its images of anonymous clutching male hands. Less effective is the contrivance of Malou clutching a kitten throughout her discovery of the true nature of her new home. Versois’ performance has enough genuine wide-eyed innocence to make such heavy-handed symbolism over-obtrusive.

Some now-familiar faces make fleeting appearances: _Carry On_ icon Joan Sims as a telephone operator, novelist Jackie Collins as one of Nick’s ‘girls’ and an uncredited Michael Caine as a bridegroom. Of the leads, Dors and Lom were the biggest names, while Versois (sister of the actress Marina Vlady) and the American-born Eddie Constantine spent most of their careers in France, each making a handful of British films in the 1950s. Constantine would later appear in _The Long Good Friday_ (1979), a vastly superior exploration of the seamier underside of London gangland life.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
This wildly incredible story, introduced as a social document by Fabian of the Yard, must be the most wholeheartedly absurd prostitute drama yet. Motivations are mysterious and characterisations grotesque. Connoisseurs of the bizarre may relish some of the production’s most ambitious moments, notably the conclusion, which features Herbert Lom scattering hundreds of bank notes from a blazing brothel in an endeavour to hasten the approaching firemen.<br>
