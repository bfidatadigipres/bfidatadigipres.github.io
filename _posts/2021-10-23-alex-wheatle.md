The biopic _Alex Wheatle_, directed by Steve McQueen, is a thoroughly pleasing work of televisual cinema, part of his new anthology series _Small Axe_ which focuses on West Indian communities in England. This episode deals with the early life of the writer Alex Wheatle, who was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services to literature for his hard-hitting stories of Black peoples, and who now writes books for young adults. McQueen explores Wheatle’s coming of age in Brixton, south London – infatuated with sound system culture, lured in by the excitements of street life, he becomes involved in the Brixton riots of 1981.  This leads to Wheatle spending time in prison, which is where he is introduced to literature.

The film’s narrative structure is classical, in that we have a protagonist who tells his tale to an inquisitive listener – in this case the Rastafarian with whom Wheatle shares a prison cell, and who encourages him to appreciate reading. We see Wheatle’s life play out in nonlinear fashion as we cut back and forth between him growing up in a children’s home, his adolescence on the streets of London, and his maturation as an adult in prison. The beats through which Wheatle progresses are also classical, as we follow his development from awkward kid in the city who must be taught the ways of urban life to confident hustler taking his destiny into his own hands.

Speaking of beats, McQueen’s film is animated by the sounds and cultural specificity of West Indian peoples, particularly their patois and their reggae music. Young Wheatle soon decides that he wants to form his own sound system, which he names Crucial Rocker. For that he needs money, and the only way to get it in his neighbourhood is through marijuana distribution. As this tale of underground life unfolds, the film begins to resemble Franco Rosso’s south-east London-set masterwork _Babylon_ (1980), which also explored urban life from a West Indian perspective, including vivid depictions of sound system culture. At 60 minutes, McQueen does not really have the canvas upon which to expand and fully explore his material, and he does not advance very far beyond the benchmark set by Rosso’s pioneering film. Still, one has to consider _Alex Wheatle_ as part of a larger whole, judging the whole series _Small Axe_ as an integral work. And even regarded in isolation, _Alex Wheatle_ is a solidly crafted and engrossing piece of drama.<br>

The takeaway from the _Small Axe_ series is surely this: Steve McQueen is doing the cultural work of narrating the histories of Black British people that for too long have remained in a cultural embargo. But what is happening now, in the current moment, that is too taboo, too hot, too politically charged, too dangerous to be shown on screen?

While watching the episode about the writer Alex Wheatle, and his journey from care home to Brixton to prison to political consciousness, I was struck by the character of Dread. He’s an older Rastafarian man serving a six-month prison sentence for declaring he was going to destroy the tomb of Edward the Confessor with a pickaxe – revenge for the British empire’s destruction of cultural artefacts around the world. He delivers one of my favourite lines: ‘Unlearn what you’ve learned.’

For a boy like the film’s Alphonso (he changes his name to Alex Wheatle later), this advice is rooted in him learning to recognise that he is Black, and Blackness is not a skin colour but a set of social conditions designed to place you at the bottom of the pile socially, and re-enforce the idea of your inherent inferiority. It’s a realisation that all Black children in majority white societies must undergo, and you can have one of two reactions: resist the reality of the situation and accept the dominance of white cultural narratives, or accept the fact that there is another story and resist the idea that white, European culture is the apex of humanity itself.

The conclusion that Dread comes to – that he must stand up for himself and learn the truth – culminates in a brilliant scene in which he recommends C.L.R. James’s _The Black Jacobins_. This is some hardcore socialist analysis of the Haitian revolution (which is why everyone should read it), but it’s the magic act of a book passing from hand to hand that got me; the cultural transmission of powerful ideas from mind to mind. What I saw in that scene was a profound comment on the importance of knowing one’s history. But deeper than that, Dread acted as curator, librarian, programmer – he was doing the work of ensuring Alphonso knew the intense, radical history of Black people, a history that has been deliberately kept out of schools and off our television screens.

Recently, I have been watching old BBC _Arena_ films, courtesy of the Ilkley Literature Festival and Speaking Volumes. The episodes cover topics such as the social history of carnival, the working-class roots of the steel pans, radical Black poets. At the end of the most recent instalment, the academic Max Farrar notes how important this kind of programming was, and how we no longer see this happening.

This struck a chord, as the struggle for Black cultural production has been characterised by censorship, avoidance delays and underfunding. Indeed the first Black British feature film, Horace Ové’s _Pressure_ (1976), which looked at a boy not dissimilar to Alex Wheatle, was shelved for at least two years by the BFI before its release because it showed police violence. The matter was too current, too politically charged. I am also thinking about _Blood Ah Go Run_ (1982) by Menelik Shabazz, which directly questioned media, state and police indifference towards the 13 dead in the New Cross Fire of 1981.

In another scene in _Alex Wheatle_ that I really appreciated, a group of young people discuss the deaths in the fire, with fear initially, but then Alex writes a song in response, and we see those same young people dancing and singing, ‘Uprising! Uprising!’

The irony of these lyrics is that we see Alex on the floor of a cell several times in the film: once, in a straitjacket after being dragged out of his classroom having been racially abused; then again when he is arrested in Brixton. I thought of Ken Fero’s recent film _Ultraviolence_, which looks at the horrendous deaths of Christopher Alder and Brian Douglas, both of whom died on the floor of a police station – Alex was lucky to live to tell the tale.

It’s as though history is not enough. We must see literal death before we can hold our institutions to account. But even then we still see corrupt judges, murderous police officers, faceless bureaucrats who call the shots and are never held to account.

And so I return to my initial question: what are we not seeing? We believe we have progressed as a society, yet films, histories and even TV programming from the 1980s still have the power to shock us. So what is happening today that is too taboo, too difficult, too confronting? Do we have the courage to confront it?<br>
