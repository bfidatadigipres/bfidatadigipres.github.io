Enjoy these radical and hugely creative films from pioneering Black artists.

The Black Arts Movement is the name given to a number of fine artists who in the 1980s used a wide-range of different media forms to explore questions around post-colonial identity, the legacies of Empire and more. Their radical work would take many forms and exist in different contexts. The films in this programme employ a variety of creative techniques as a way of presenting their ideas and discussing each artist’s vision, often with an emphasis of personal and interpersonal witness. The makers include Simone Alexander, Zarina Bhimji, Sonia Boyce, Allan De Souza, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney and Claudette Johnson, in films by Amanda Holiday, Ayo Akingbade, plus Edward George and Trevor Mathison of the Black Audio Film Collective.

The screening will be followed by a discussion with artist and poet Amanda Holiday and researcher, lecturer, curator and artist Richard Hylton, chaired by assistant curator, BFI National Archive projects, Xavier Pillai.<br>

**About the panel**<br>
Artist and poet **Amanda Holiday** completed a degree in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art in 1987. She exhibited with and was active in the 2nd wave of the black British art movement before moving into film and script writing – directing short experimental films for the Arts Council, BFI and Channel 4 before studying briefly at the NFTS. Between 2001-10, she lived in Cape Town where she worked in educational television.

Her chapbook ‘The Art Poems’ was published in April 2018 as part of _New Generation African Poets_ (Tano) and her writing has appeared in _Prairie Schooner_ (US), _South Bank Poetry Magazine_, _Poetry Birmingham Literary Journal_, _Lolwe_, _ANMLY_ (US), _CUSP_ and _Frieze_. In 2020, she founded the UK’s first crowdfunded poetry press Black Sunflowers, and is currently a doctoral student at the University of Brighton.

**Richard Hylton** is a researcher, lecturer, curator and artist. He is currently a lecturer in contemporary art at SOAS, London.

His writing has featured in a number of British and US-based journals and books including in the _Routledge Companion to African American Art History_, _Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art_, _the International Review of African American Art_, _Critical Interventions: Journal of African Art and Visual Culture_, _Art Monthly_, _Art Review_, _Burlington Magazine_ and _Panorama: Journal of the Association of Historians of American Art_. His book-length study,  _The Nature of the Beast: Cultural Diversity and the Visual Arts Sector, A Study of Policies, Initiatives and Attitudes 1976-2006_, was published by University  of Bath.

Hylton is currently researching aspects of Black diasporic art and art history including a monographic study on British art history, race and the body politic, African American art in the international arena, and an exploration of the relationships between contemporary art, ethnography and the western museum.

**Xavier Alexandre Pillai** is assistant curator for H22 as part of the Archive projects team at the BFI National Archive. He joined the BFI in 2018 as a trainee in the video conservation department sponsored by ICON, working to preserve legacy formats and interdepartmentally throughout the National Archive.

His interests lie in multicultural television, government communications, documentary films, and pre-independence colonial films.
