_High Hopes_, Mike Leigh’s first theatrically released feature since _Bleak Moments_ in 1971, is even less plotted than is usual for this director. Set mostly around the King’s Cross area of London, it examines the interconnected lives of seven characters: Cyril, a despatch rider, and his live-in companion Shirley; his widowed mother, Mrs Bender; his sister Valerie and her crassly entrepreneurial husband Martin; and his mother’s next-door neighbours – frankly upper-crust rather than ‘upwardly mobile’ as the press book describes them – Rupert and Laetitia. And almost the only generator of narrative suspense is the long pivotal scene in which, having forgotten her keys,  Mrs Bender finds herself locked out of her house.

What is the difference between Leigh’s demystificatory essays _in_ working-class culture and, say, Auberon Waugh’s demystificatory essays _about_ working-class culture? This is what I propose. Where Leigh says to his, after all, predominantly middle-class audience: ‘You think of yourselves as liberal but isn’t it true, underneath, that you fear and despise the working classes?’, what Waugh says is: ‘You think of yourselves as liberal but isn’t it true, underneath, that you fear and despise the working classes?’

On paper, as you will have noticed, there is no difference whatsoever, which is why Leigh has been censured, often by those who would seem to be his natural allies and champions, for a gratuitous and near-sadistic lack of generosity towards his working-class protagonists. The difference, in fact, is one of interpretation and insinuation. For Waugh it is the underlying anxieties, not the virtuously liberal ideals, that are the impulses to be trusted, nurtured and indulged without shame. For Leigh, by contrast, it is necessary, if one is ever to exorcise it, that one confront head on one’s deep-seated apprehension of sociocultural Otherness, and what his films do is force that confrontation upon us. And unlike the outwardly similar work of Alan Bennett (whose humour derives from the replacement of Wildean paradoxes by the platitudes of the educationally underprivileged), he does not trade in either parody or nostalgia.

If I have dwelt on this aspect of _High Hopes_, it is because, as always with Leigh, he just cannot get the other classes right. With their braying hahas, their crates of champers and the infantilism of their neo-, crypto- and pseudo-Brideshead sexuality, Rupert and Laetitia would appear to belong not merely to another class but to another genre. Even their names strike one as silly and overdetermined, anyone’s off-the-top-of-the-head notion of how the other half tends to be christened; and when Laetitia makes passing mention of a certain Araminta de Winter (unless I misheard), there is a distinct and incongruous whiff of both Dumas _père_ and _fils_. I must confess though, that these solecisms did not bother me a whit. From Alan Bridges to Piers Haggard, and from Charles Sturridge to the man who directs the Hovis ads, the British cinema is positively crawling with filmmakers who have ‘got’ the ruling classes down to the last gaiter button, as they used to say, and I find it endearing and wholly to Leigh’s credit that he has pitched his tent far from that particular mainstream.

Unfamiliarity with the idiom, moreover, does not prevent him from neatly impaling his upper-class characters on a host of revealing behavioural or verbal notations – such as Laetitia’s expression of exquisitely pained forbearance when she realises that she will have to harbour the slightly ratty Mrs Bender under her gentrified roof until a set of spare keys can be fetched, her bracing ‘Chop chop!’ as the old woman totters up the steps and her airily callous, ‘I’ll show you where it is in a minute,’ when she asks, with some urgency, to go to the toilet. (‘Oh, you mean the lavatory.’) But it has always been Leigh’s peculiar genius to demonstrate that there is indeed a reality behind the baffling improbability of other people’s lives, to bring even monstrous Otherness into intense and startling focus, to draw the tritest of human gestures out by the roots and shake them in our faces.

In _Grown-Ups_, for instance, he took an infuriatingly shrill and scatty young woman, the sort who is forever ‘popping in for a cuppa’, and by exposing the loneliness behind the stereotype showed us _where she was coming from_. In _Meantime_ he made sense out of a skinhead. And a single shot in _High Hopes_ – of old Mrs Bender on her front doorstep clutching her chest and gasping for breath – conjured up (for me, at least) a lifetime of glimpsing such people in the street and wondering guiltily whether one ought to help or leave them be, whether they are having a heart attack or are just out of breath, and so on.

But the film has to be, and is, more than simply a cluster of beadily observed vignettes of Thatcher’s Britain: there is, at its centre, the story of Cyril and Shirley, one of the most poignantly loving couples (along with, in my lonely opinion, Sammy and Rosie) that our national cinema has produced.

Since the performances of Philip Davis and Ruth Sheen are beyond praise, there’s no point in praising them. Suffice to say that the characters are alive and true to a hallucinatory degree, an _effet du réel_ rendered all the more powerful by the fact that they are, unashamedly, unambiguously, the representatives of good, of good-humoured civic responsibility, of that sense of societal solidarity that, as we know, does not exist for Mrs Thatcher. Their responses to the needs of others recall those of Londoners in the Blitz. And Cyril’s reply to the sneeringly put question of what exactly it is he stands for – ‘I want everyone to have enough to eat’ – is a noble reaffirmation of socialist priorities in an age of postmodernism, post-Fordism, neo-Marxism, all of them seductively revisionist strategies devised to make liberals forget that, no, not nearly everyone has enough to eat.

Cyril and Shirley both have and are the high hopes of Leigh’s title, which is absolutely not ironic; and theirs is a story of grace under pressure.
