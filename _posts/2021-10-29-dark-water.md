According to Alfred Hitchcock’s oft-quoted ‘bomb-under-the-table’ theory, the key to screen thrills is the _anticipation_, rather than the _realisation_, of an approaching terror. It is a lesson well proven by the Japanese chiller _Dark_ _Water_, a splendidly derivative frightener whose air of creeping anxiety and out-of-the-corner-of-your-eye unease almost strangles the viewer into breathless rigidity. Time and again we are offered visual fragments (was that a figure at the half-opened door? the face of a child in a pool of water?) drenched in the uncanny allure of sights unseen yet hazily recognised. That such a film should also deliver not one, but two (and possibly even three) moments of skin-crawling revelation testifies to its generic roadworthiness; as a horror shocker, both suggestive and demonstrative, _Dark_ _Water_ is one of the most satisfyingly scary pictures of the year.

Returning to the novels of Kôji Suzuki, whose writings provided the basis of _Ringu_ (and its sequel _Ringu 2_), director Hideo Nakata draws again from the wellsprings of modern urban anxiety and timeless human terror. Fans of _Ringu_ will recognise recurrent leitmotifs, from the specific figure of the faceless child lost in water (Mitsuko, the mysterious missing child in this story, bears an uncanny resemblance to the ghostly Sadako from _Ringu_) and the use of blurry televisual information (CCTV footage mirroring _Ringu_’s cursed videotape) to the more general spectres of parental grief and abandonment, and the unstoppable resurfacing of long-sunken guilt. _Dark_ _Water_ serves as a thematic companion piece to _Ringu_ – even more so than some of that film’s ostensible sequels – revisiting the psychodramas which lurked therein. Stylistically, too, the re-teaming of composer Kenji Kawai and cinematographer Junichirô Hayashi (ably aided by lighting director Meicho Tomiyama) thaws us back into the murky depths of Nakata’s breakthrough feature, with Hayashi’s extraordinary eye for the everyday uncanny once again well complemented by Kawai’s atonal screechings and rumblings; the sound of a quiet, ordered urban lifestyle gradually falling apart.

Familiar too are the nods to classic western shockers, with the ghost of Nic Roeg’s _Don’t Look Now_ (1973) stalking the edges of the waterlogged drama, and casual asides toward such films as Robert Wise’s _Audrey Rose_ (1977), John Irvin’s _Ghost Story_ (1981), Adrian Lyne’s _Fatal Attraction_ (1987) and  M. Night Shyamalan’s _The Sixth Sense_ (1999). The relationship between newly single mother Yoshimi and her increasingly haunted daughter Ikuko, who may or may not be the victim of something more eerie than parental divorce, also mirrors that between Chris and Regan MacNeil in _The Exorcist_ (1973). None of which is intended to suggest that _Dark Water_ is simply a work of imitation or ‘homage’; on the contrary, by creating such a generically literate movie, the filmmakers can toy with the audience’s expectations, employing these readily identifiable signifiers to chilling effect.

Framed in chilly blue and green hues, with flashbacks drenched in melancholic ochre, _Dark_ _Water_ inhabits a cine-literate environment in which everything seems ominous, from the angular shape of Ikuko’s kindergarten to the garish colours of Mitsuko’s coat and bag which seem designed to tear cracks in Yoshimi’s sense of fragile sanity. While the revelation that she was once driven half-mad by proof-reading graphically sadistic novels may be a knowing reference to Suzuki’s literary reputation, it also sheds light on her fractured character, casting her as one who becomes drowned by stories, unable to establish boundaries between fantasy and reality.

It is to Nakata’s credit that having marshalled such genuinely unsettling material, he closes _Dark_ _Water_ with a denouement and coda heavy with melancholic loss and triumphant sadness – exactly the qualities which Hollywood will doubtless obliterate should this suffer the same remake treatment as _Ringu_. Remembering that, as Shirley Jackson said, fear and guilt are sisters, Nakata offers a sacrificial mother-and-daughter resolution worthy of the most down-to-earth, heartfelt melodrama. We are left with images of surreal horror bound together by a tangible sense of loss deep-rooted in domestic, familial reality. Now that’s scary.

_Dark Water_ fits most comfortably into the _kaidan-eiga_ (ghost-story film) tradition, much of which remains little seen outside Japan. Nakata cites _Ghost Story of Yotsuya_ (an oft filmed adaptation of a kabuki play) as indicative of the fundamental divide between east/west ghostly traditions. Other (perhaps atypical) examples of the genre which have gained recognition in the west include Satsuo Yamamoto’s _Tales of Peonies and Lanterns_ (1968); Masaki Kobayashi’s Cannes prize-winning anthology _Kwaidan_ (1964), whose chilling ‘Black Hair’ sequence reverberates throughout modem Asian horror; and _Kuroneko_ (1968) from director Kaneto Shindo, whose _Onibaba_ (1964) was once described by _The Exorcist_ director William Friedkin as ‘the scariest film I ever saw.’

To this list western audiences may add Kenji Mizoguchi’s 1953 Venice Silver lion-winner _Ugetsu Monogatari_. Although not perceived as part of the _kaidan-eiga_ canon in Japan, Mizoguchi’s classic had a profound impact on Nakata, both for its iconic lakebound set-pieces and for the neorealist flavour of its ‘supernatural’ scenes (a sense of heightened reality rather than fantastical escape). Based on stories which are essentially Japanese adaptations of Chinese originals, _Ugetsu Monogatari_ presents its ghosts in solidly human form, leaving both audience and protagonists largely unaware of the otherworldly nature of its central spectres (such as Machika Kyo’s alluring Lady Wakasa) for much of the drama. ‘Unlike ghost stories in the west,’ observed American critic Roger Ebert, ‘Mizoguchi’s film does not try to startle or shock; the discovery of the second ghost comes for us as a moment of quiet revelation, and we understand the gentle, forgiving spirit that inspired it.’

As Nakata observed in an interview with the Japanese arts and culture magazine _Kateigaho_: ‘The difference between Japanese horror and western horror can be traced back to the difference in religious beliefs. When making horror films, the methods of describing the spirit world and the expression of horror are totally different between Japan and the west. In a culture where the influence of monotheism such as Christianity is strong, the antimony, or confrontation between the devil and God becomes the fundamental conflict.’ While Suzuki points to writers such as Junichiro Tanizaki, Naoya Shiga and Soseki Natsume as evidence that ‘Japanese literature is full of ghosts’, film fans need look no further than the runaway domestic success of Hayao Miyazaki’s _Spirited Away_ (a childhood fantasy in which a young girl finds employment in a bath-house for spirits) for proof of the ease with which audiences of all ages in the east accept such concepts.

‘Walking along a body of water, you sense ghosts being born,’ Suzuki also told _Kateigaho_, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. In Britain, however, Nakata recently felt the need to explain that ‘Japanese ghosts are supposed to appear wherever the water exists’ and to clarify the ‘strong connection between water and the supernatural’ that underwrites his most celebrated works.
