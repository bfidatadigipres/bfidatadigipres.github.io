Laconic is the word. Say little but say it well. Write in sentences sand-blasted by time, words sucked to stone before they’re spoken. Such is the prose of Cormac McCarthy, a beauteous thing winnowed down over a long career from the supple effusion of _All the Pretty Horses_ to the stripped-bone clarity of _The Road._ It’s the way people say only what they have to in the places where his books are set, the way images are cut in simple strokes, each word axing clean the apt description. _No Country for Old Men_ unfolds in the Texas borderlands of the 1980s, near the Rio Grande. It’s a quasi-thriller laced with regret for the way things are going, for how plain-speaking integrity is being destroyed by the encroaching violence of the drugs trade.

Joel and Ethan Coen, too, are on neighbourly terms with the laconic. Given to deadpan avoidance of the serious in interviews, they produce screenplays that show a po-faced passion for pith. Characters in _Blood Simple_ (1983), _Fargo_ (1995) and _O Brother Where Art Thou?_ (2000), to take just three of their films, practise a verbal exactitude that is an essential part of the texture we expect from a Coen brothers movie.

The brothers are acknowledged masters of the punchline-plentiful script, but a weak run of films suggested they might have lost a level of care or tried to tailor their work too much to that elusive wider audience. _The Man Who Wasn’t There_ (2001) was a patchy and charmless period-piece enigma; the romantic comedy _Intolerable Cruelty_ (2003) seemed to lack self-belief, the remake of the Ealing comedy _The Ladykillers_ (2004) was a huge misjudgement. Yet if one were looking for the ideal artists to translate the already cinematic prose of _No Country for Old Men_ as directly as possible into great cinema, the Coens would be the obvious choice.

The Texas/Mexico borderlands have the harsh and harrowing beauty of a wilderness. You feel the wind between McCarthy’s words but you fear the cinematic image might diminish the ethereal to the stock gesture of a patrol car on a dirt road pulling someone over. Right from the start, however, Roger Deakins’ ravishing photography seeks the immanent in the landscape as the voice of an unidentified sheriff tells us his fears for the future. And in the opening minutes, after the first killing by soft-shoe supervillain Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a strangulation he relishes with demonic delight, Deakins is shooting an expanse of semi-desert scrub occupied by a flock of deer through the crosshairs of a telescopic gunsight. As the image shimmers with heat haze and blurs with sight adjustments, you already feel assured that this is the happiest marriage of novel to filmmakers for years.

This rifle belongs to Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), whose first shot wounds a deer. He follows the blood trail, but instead of finding his kill he arrives at the slaughter ground of a drugs-gang shootout. Bullet riddled trucks are circled round and corpses are strewn everywhere. Llewelyn could just move on, and we feel his anxiety about the decision, but something makes him check the scene. One wounded Mexican is still alive in a truck, pleading for water, but Llewelyn leaves him there, taking his machine pistol. And then the hunter finds the story’s real game; a briefcase full of money ($2.4 million). He removes it on impulse and hides it under the trailer home he shares with his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald). That night he remembers the Mexican he left alive, and returns to the scene with water.

But it’s not the same anymore. Some things have altered. Soon he’s being pursued through the scrub by an attack dog and a truck with men firing automatic weapons from behind a bank of headlights. It transpires later that Chigurh, too, will be on his trail, while Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) – whose voice we hear at the opening – will also slowly find his way to him. If you were to consider Chigurh as the bad guy, Bell as the good guy, and Llewelyn as the one caught between darkness and light, you wouldn’t be far from the truth.

What’s most remarkable about the plot that unfolds from here is how much it resembles and yet shies away from the ‘thriller’ tag. Fateful events barrel along with the requisite momentum and there are many brilliant sequences of protracted high tension such as the moment when Llewelyn senses that Chigurh, the professional psychopath, is just outside his hotel-room door. There are as many picaresque surprises as you would find in the most oddball of the Coens’ films, several of them revolving around fate hanging on the toss of a coin. Yet nearly all of this is Cormac McCarthy’s original material; the Coens have resisted manfully the temptation to tinker. Even the sharp one-liners, which those who haven’t read the book will assume are the Coens’ own, are mostly McCarthy-minted.

Maybe the Coens are even guilty of being too faithful. For there are endings here – ones I won’t reveal – that are self-consciously literary and therefore hard to cinematise. These may leave those most pleased to find themselves once again with the Coens in pure genre territory feeling a little short-changed. There’s no supercharged cathartic climax – though for me what happens instead keeps the film tied to the heart of the novel, with its desire to transcend the quotidian for a god’s-eye overview. This may be one reason why the film has the quality of the best US cinema of the 1970s.

Certainly the cast seem as if they’ve been steeped for years in McCarthyite atmosphere. Jones might have ducked another Texan law enforcement role but could hardly have resisted this; Brolin is the most natural leading man for this sort of thing that Hollywood has unearthed in a long time; Bardem is creepy and implacable as a nemesis inured to reason; Macdonald is so plausibly Texan as to seem separated at birth from a Scots twin.

Those of us who have long thought of the Coens as superb technicians, comedians and offbeat entertainers rather than makers of probing works will have to concede a breakthrough here. With _No Country for Old Men_ they’ve stopped being smirking nerds – there’s nothing here that smacks of ‘look at what we just did’. Rather, this is a mature film about the US hinterland that can be put beside the likes of John Ford and Clint Eastwood.<br>
