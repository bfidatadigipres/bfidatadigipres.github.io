In the summer of 1969 a documentary was broadcast by the BBC series _Cause for Concern_, which set out in detail a number of shocking cases of police brutality and corruption against members of the Black community. In the ensuing controversy, and after a lengthy campaign, Darcus Howe and other members of the public were invited to participate in a live panel discussion – his first brush with broadcast media.<br>

Join Tony Warner to learn more about the programme that inadvertently began Darcus Howe’s engagement with TV.<br>

**Tony Warner** is a community activist and guerrilla historian. He has been exhibiting educational and empowering films about African/Caribbean history in museums, art galleries, restaurants and youth clubs since 2000. He pioneered community partnerships with and lectured at the Imperial War Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Museum of Docklands and the BFI – which all led to huge increases in Black audiences.

Tony is the co-founder and chair of the African Odysseys programme.  This grassroots initiative has been exhibiting African diaspora films plus Q&As on a monthly basis at the BFI Southbank since 2007. It is the only such programme in the country and has been attended by tens of thousands of people. He is also the founder of Black History Walks in London, a group which explores the Caribbean and African history of the capital via 12 guided walks, talks, films, courses, bus tours and river cruises. The tours have been featured on various national and international media such as CNN, BBC, ITV,  _The Guardian_, Channel 4 etc. Since 2011, in an ongoing collaboration with the Nubian Jak charity he has sponsored five Black historical blue plaques across London and researched ten more.

As a management consultant specialising in diversity, he has trained various corporate, government and educational agencies; including creating a 26-week course for pupils in primary and secondary schools to improve self-esteem, behaviour and academic performance.

Tony is the author of _Black History Walks in London Volume 1_. The book explores the African/Caribbean presence in London over the last 2000 years.  It is due to be published by Jacaranda Books in October 2021. He is currently working on a GCSE history book on migration and Black British Civil Rights for use in schools.<br>
