_My Love Has Been Burning_ has in more ways than one a central position in Mizoguchi’s suite of feminist ﬁlms of the late ’40s and early ’50s, which stretches from _The Victory of Women_ to _The Life of Oharu_. The ﬁlm is drawn from the autobiography of Hideko Kageyama, a late 19th century pioneer in the ﬁght for women’s rights in Japan. Kageyama’s book _Mekake no Hanshogai_ (_Half a Lifetime as a Mistress_), provides the model for the ﬁlm’s central character, much of the contemporary political background, and a number of the ﬁlm’s plot details. In her book, Kageyama presents herself as a woman who behaved in as masculine a fashion as possible; Mizoguchi’s chief departure from his source was, therefore, his _feminisation_ of his own character Eiko Hirayama.

The notion of party politics had a long and difﬁcult struggle to gain acceptance in Japan. The ﬁrst attempts to form organisations in opposition to the national government were widely viewed as something like treason against the state, not least because they came hard on the heels of the Seinan civil war (background to the action of Mizoguchi’s _Oyuki the Virgin_). The national government under the Emperor Meiji was very well aware that Japan was backward by international standards, and felt that only strong, patriarchal rule could bring the country up to a level of modernity and prosperity commensurate with western countries.

Liberal demands for representative government countered by asserting that such a reform was essential in any programme to _modernise_ Japan.  Early support for them was scattered but the strong nationalist bias of their argument won over more and more of the Japanese middle class, many of whom were beneﬁtting from the introduction of compulsory education in 1872. But police raids on early political campaign meetings (such as are seen in the opening scene of the ﬁlm) did actually occur quite often.

The ﬁrst group that organised itself into a small political party was the _Jiyuto_ (Freedom Party; the English term ‘liberal’ is a more accurate translation, but its connotations are distinctly misleading). It was fundamentally a party of middle-class capitalists anxious to defend their own interests, although many of its younger members _were_ vocal on the subjects of citizen’s rights in general and women’s rights in particular. The _Jiyuto_ was joined in 1881 by the _Kaishinto_ (Progressive Party), founded by ex-government member Shigenonu Okuma, which had an even stronger capitalist bias. The two _opposition_ parties were as hostile to each other as to the national government, and their internecine tensions made it relatively easy for the government to suppress them. But both parties survived, tenuously, under various names, and are the ancestors of the two conservative parties in post-war Japanese politics.

It is interesting to note the broad similarity between the plots of _My Love Has Been Burning_ and one of Mizoguchi’s earliest (and therefore lost) ﬁlms, _Haizan no Uta Wa Kanashi (Sad Is the Song of Defeat)_. The latter was made in 1923, and was the ﬁrst of Mizoguchi’s ﬁlms to attract any critical attention. It concerns a young woman who leaves her home in a village to follower her student boyfriend to Tokyo; she returns home, chastened, when he rejects her. The 1923 ﬁlm, of course, has no feminist bias. The girl is welcomed back by her stepfather, who eventually takes her away from the village to help  her forget.  
**Tony Rayns**

Made very cheaply and quickly (as is evident from the roughish visual texture of the film) _My Love Has Been Burning_ was harshly criticised on its original release in Japan, being characterised as ‘a film made by a wild animal’; and in an interview with Tsuneo Hazumi, Mizoguchi wryly admitted that he had made a ‘Barbaric’ film, one arising from the frustrations of the war years and inspired by the paintings Picasso did just afterwards: ‘Or at any rate, I wanted to engage objects hand-to-hand.’ Something of this passion, the amalgam of rage and pity that makes for the jagged edges of a painting like ‘Guernica’, is evident: most notably in the factory sequence, where a kaleidoscope of contrasting moods and tempi – police dispersing rioters in the streets, a meeting in a tranquilly moonlit forest, Eiko’s stealthy infiltration of the factory, the lurid brutalities inside, the cleansing flames as it burns – are fused into a genuine fury of protest. Such moments are, for Mizoguchi, relatively rare here. Least satisfactory when it focuses on its formulary characters, _My Love Has Been Burning_ touches brilliance whenever it withdraws into abstraction: the magnificent celebration of the opening sequence, for instance, with the welcoming banners raised by the Liberals on the quayside conjuring a complementary image as the sails bringing Toshiko Kishida to Okayama hove into sight.

**Kinuyo Tanaka**  
Kinuyo Tanaka was Mizoguchi’s key collaborator in the last decade of his career. In the late 1940s, they worked together on a sequence of feminist melodramas. In _Victory of Women_ (_Josei no shori_, 1946), Tanaka played a lawyer defending a female client accused of murdering her child; in _Women of the Night_ (_Yoru no onnatachi_, 1948), she was a prostitute in the inhospitable environment of war-damaged Osaka.

In _My Love Has Been Burning_ (_Waga koi wa moenu_, 1949), a masterpiece of feminist melodrama, she played the wife of a 19th-century liberal politician whose enlightened values do not extend into his own home. Mizoguchi and Tanaka jointly produced one of the cinema’s most radical feminist statements – going far beyond the liberal expectations of the American occupiers.  Yet Tanaka’s simultaneous air of vulnerability and resilience also made her indelible as the wise, tolerant, understanding and suffering heroines of _Ugetsu monogatari_ (1953) and _Sansho the Bailiff_ (_Sansho dayu_, 1954).

In fact, Tanaka gave outstanding performances for almost all of the great Japanese directors. Her range is typified by her collaborations with Keisuke Kinoshita: at the beginning of the 1950s, in _Wedding Ring_ (_Konyaku yubiwa_, 1950), she was still able to play a sensual romantic lead, falling in love with the doctor (played by Toshiro Mifune) treating her ailing husband; by 1958, she was totally convincing as the old woman preparing for death in Kinoshita’s  _The Ballad of Narayama_ (_Narayama bushiko_). To bring verisimilitude to the harrowing scene in which she bashes out her teeth with a stone, the actress famously had several of her own teeth removed. Tanaka also became Japan’s first successful female director, realising an impressive series of feminist melodramas in the 1950s and 1960s.
