Born in Trinidad during the dying days of British colonialism, Darcus Howe settled in the UK in the 1960s. As an activist he was central to organising political campaigns, including the historic Mangrove Nine trial and The Black Peoples’ Day of Action, 1981. Howe also became a household name with a career in broadcasting that spanned three decades from the 1980s. His politically provocative and penetrating stance was richly imbued with his passion for literature and the arts, and he brought poets, musicians and his mentor CLR James to the fore. Changing the face of TV, Howe created stimulating programming that stands as a landmark in enlightened broadcasting.

Join Tony Warner, of Black History Walks, and assorted special guests for a day in which we explore Howe’s activist years and examine how they connect to his work in TV through talks, interviews and a wealth of clips with contributions from key figures including writer and exec producer Farrukh Dhondy, and Race Today Collective founding member and fellow activist, Leila Hassan.<br>

From 1968 to 1978 Dhondy worked as a further education lecturer and schoolteacher in the Midlands and London, before entering television. From 1984 to 1997, Dhondy worked as Commissioning Editor, Multicultural Programming, for Channel 4 TV, UK. In this capacity, he was responsible for hundreds of hours of TV in all genres: entertainment, situation, comedy, TV drama, film, education and factual, and helped greenlight iconic shows like _Desmond’s_ and _The Bandung File_.

From 1997 to 2002, Dhondy worked as a freelance journalist and writer, contributing articles to Indian newspapers and magazines like _The Pioneer, Asian Age_ and _India Today_. In 2002, he joined a film company based in India, Kaleidoscope International. His literary output is immense.

**Leila Hassan Howe** was a founding member of the Race Today Collective. She was an activist in the Black Unity and Freedom Party in the Black Power Movement of the ‘70’s. As a member of the Institute of Race Relations she was part of the group that staged a palace coup that radicalised that institution.

She is one of the editors of the Race Today Anthology ‘Here to Stay and Here to Fight’ and is currently a member of the Darcus Howe Legacy Collective.

Leila was a member of the New Cross Massacre Action Committee which organised the historic Black Peoples Day of Action when 20,000 marched through the streets of London in protest at the murder of 13 young people who perished in the fire at 439 New Cross Road.

She is the widow of Darcus Howe.<br>

**Tamara Howe**, the daughter of Darcus Howe, began her media career in the mid-eighties alongside her dad and Tariq Ali, who were launching their groundbreaking series _The Bandung File_. Those early years at _Bandung_ gave her the unique opportunity to work across a wide range of Black and Asian programming, following stories which took her across the globe; from Selma, Alabama to Kingston Jamaica, to Toxteth, Liverpool.

In 1989 Tamara joined London Weekend Television, where she later got the chance to work with Darcus again – this time on the _Devil’s Advocate_. She was by his side in Durban South Africa when he recorded the infamous Buthelezi episode.

Thirty-seven years on, Tamara is still working in the TV industry and currently holds the role of Director of Commercial and Operations at Naked TV.

Outside of work she is a founding member of the Darcus Howe Legacy, and sits on the Board of the Edinburgh TV Festival and the charity MEWE 360.<br>

**Anthony Wall**<br>
Martin Scorsese described _Arena_ as ‘home to some of the greatest non-fiction filmmaking of the past 40 years’. Anthony Wall was at the heart of _Arena_ for those 40 years, first as a director, then as series editor from 1985 to 2018. During that time, _Arena_ won nine BAFTAs, with twenty five nominations; the Prix Italia; six Royal Television Society awards; Primetime and International Emmys; the Peabody and numerous other honours including the Special Medallion at the Telluride Film Festival for ‘cutting edge filmmaking’. It was there that Werner Herzog, a fellow medallion recipient, declared _Arena_ to be ‘the oasis in the sea of insanity that is television’. Since standing down as Editor, Wall has been committed to curating seasons of _Arena_ classics and recomposing the _Arena_ archive of 700 films into newly created outcomes and forms. In 2019 Wall and _Arena_ were given the Mel Novikoff Award at the San Francisco Film Festival for ‘an outstanding contribution to cinema’.<br>

He has been exhibiting educational and empowering films about African/Caribbean history in museums, art galleries, restaurants and youth clubs since 2000.

As a management consultant specialising in diversity, he has trained various corporate, government and educational agencies; including creating a 26-week course for pupils in primary and secondary schools to improve self-esteem, behaviour and academic performance.

It is due to be published by Jacaranda Books in October 2021. He is currently working on a GCSE history book on migration and Black British Civil Rights for use in schools.
