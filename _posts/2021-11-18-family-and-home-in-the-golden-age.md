The various spaces of the Japanese home provide one of the most inviting aspects of classical Japanese cinema. Join Professor Alastair Phillips (University of Warwick) to examine the changing representation of familial relations and domestic life in several key films screening during our season. This wide-ranging and richly illustrated talk will combine historical context with clips, and offer an opportunity for audience engagement.

**Alastair Phillips** is a Professor in Film Studies at the University of Warwick.  He teaches international film history and aesthetics with special emphasis on the cultural representation of place, location, and movement. He is the co-editor of _Japanese Cinema: Texts and Contexts_ and _The Japanese Cinema Book_ and is currently completing a BFI Classic on _Tokyo Story_.
