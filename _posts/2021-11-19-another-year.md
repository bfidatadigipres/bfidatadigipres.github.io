**Mike Leigh and Lesley Manville on ‘Another Year’**

_Few people get to make so many films together. Has that process of working together changed at all over the years?_

_Lesley Manville:_ I don’t think it has really very much. There’s more time now... But it’s true that whatever time you have, you do it.

_Mike Leigh:_ One of the times we worked together, an actor had been dreadful as the social worker in _Secrets & Lies_ [1996], to such an extent that it was embarrassing even to look at the rushes… So I thought, ‘Who could do it? We’ll get a woman so it doesn’t embarrass him.’ And Lesley could do it, and she was the perfect person to play a social worker... We then did a potted process.

_LM:_ Yes, it was different because we knew it had to be a social worker, and the scene had to be about a woman finding her birth mother, so it was this hybrid situation, really. But nevertheless, creating a character and all of that was the same.

_ML:_ On _Topsy-Turvy_ [1999] you famously did a massive amount of research. You were looking into dentistry – I don’t know what it had to do with Gilbert and Sullivan! That kind of research has no parallel if you’re doing contemporary things. But on _Another Year_, although you did a tiny amount of research into what Mary would do, you spent a huge amount of time maturing a condition and accumulating her layers of mostly bad experience.

_LM:_ You do feel that you could go on ad infinitum. Of course, there does come a point where you have to stop and start shooting. But actually that stuff I was getting together with Mary about absorbing the condition, you could have just gone on and on and on.

_ML:_ From my point of view, God forbid it should ever go on and on and on!  It’s about making a film. The great confusion that arises [when people discuss my work] is that it’s about the process that precedes the film. Of course, every building has its foundations, and the so-called process, which varies considerably in its application, is fantastically important. But what matters is what we do when we go out and make the film.

_If the character is someone like Mary, who we may all have met at dinner parties – as opposed say to a Victorian woman like Kitty Gilbert, who you played in_ Topsy-Turvy _– does that make the process shorter?_

_LM:_ As I get older, I’m playing older characters. Twenty years ago it was quicker, because you kind of get to 30 and that’s it. Where you’re creating Tom and Gerri and Mary’s lives – and Mary has been in their lives for 20 years – you get to 30 and you’ve still got another 20 years to develop.

_ML:_ What you said a moment ago could be construed as sounding as though the length of time taken is based on the needs of the character, but of course the length of time to do it is the length of time there is, and in the end everything is worked out in a pragmatic way.

But the character isn’t really defined until we get to the bit that nobody talks about, but which is the most important bit – which is where we convert that raw material into very precise stuff. The only moment where the character really lives and exists is when the camera is turned on, and when you hit those precise, distilled, fundamental and essential moments. So it’s an ongoing process. Although in principle you create the character and she exists and then you film.

_I’m interested in the dynamic in_ Another Year _between the ostensibly happy couple – Tom and Gerri – and the very lonely individual, Mary. The film gives a sense of all the different aspects of something as complicated as that._

_LM:_ With someone like Mary, we talked about and explored various areas of her loneliness and how she copes with it, but it was only as the film went on that you could see the loneliness in her over-chirpiness and her drunkenness.

_ML:_ But also I don’t know how you could put into a conventional script the sum total of Mary, because what you see is not only her condition now – you also get that she’s been abused and exploited and had good and bad relationships with guys. You can see her in those situations through the layers of her behaviour.

_In one of your interviews you mention that you used to say that other people could make films in this way if they wanted to, but now you’re saying nobody else could arrive at the point you’re at._

_ML:_ I’ve met young actors who’ve said, ‘We did your process at drama school.’ I don’t know what that process is. There are certain procedures, but Lesley, you tell me if it’s been exactly the same every time we’ve done it?

_LM:_ No, not in detail. Over the years it’s changed because you’ve got better as a filmmaker, and we’ve got better as actors.

_I assume you must have reached some kind of shorthand form of communication._

_LM:_ When we first met I had never been close to that type of work, and hadn’t thought about the kind of actress I wanted to be. So we weren’t a natural pairing. But then when we did work together it became apparent to both of us very quickly that there was something about us that was good together.

I had no notion of playing anybody who was not me. We started to create a character who was so unlike me. And I just loved improvising. The whole thing about creating a character from scratch seemed to make perfect sense to me. In many ways we’re quite similar – we’re quite thorough people.

_ML:_ When it comes to the precision of scripting, Lesley is impeccable. I can give a note about a shift in nuance, and Lesley can get it. So that’s why you get this modulation in Mary.
