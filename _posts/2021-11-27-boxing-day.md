_+ Q&A with writer-director Aml Ameen_

The first ever Black British rom-com, _Boxing Day_ marks the ground-breaking directorial debut of acclaimed actor Aml Ameen.

After making a splash in 2006’s _Kidulthood_, and as the headstrong PC Lewis Hardy on ITV’s _The Bill_, Ameen made the move to America in 2009 where he starred in David Kelly’s legal drama _Harry’s Law_, the George Lucas-produced WWII feature _Red Tails_, opposite Oprah Winfrey in Lee Daniels’ _The Butler_, and the hit YA adaptation _The Maze Runner._

In 2018, Ameen returned to the UK to star in Idris Elba’s directorial debut _Yardie_, which premiered at the Sundance film festival. More recently, he starred in the science fiction thriller _Parallel_ and played Simon in Michaela Coel’s award-winning TV series _I May Destroy You_.

But even as his acting career was taking off in the US, Ameen had his sights set behind the camera and in 2018, was all set to make his feature directorial debut with _A Night Worth Living_, based on his 2011 short, _Drink, Drugs & KFC_. Three weeks before filming was due to start, however, the financing fell through, and the movie collapsed. Fueled by the disappointment and encouraged by his close friend and creative collaborator Bruce Purnell, Ameen channeled his frustrations into another script, one loosely based on his own life, family, and friends.

‘It took me the best part of a decade to get the opportunity to write something that people would be willing to take a chance on me directing,’ says Ameen. ‘And when that film went down, I said, “I need to make a film. I will pay for it myself if I have to!” So, I wrote _Boxing Day,_ about a guy coming home to London from Los Angeles for Christmas and based it on my family. Though we’re not all religious, we always get together on Boxing Day to have a big party to celebrate our family.’

Ameen says his family’s Boxing Day celebrations start small. ‘It’s 20 people, having a drink, no one sees each other throughout the year, so it’s the family coming together. But I have five sisters, so my youngest sisters will bring their friends. Then my younger brother brings his friends. And I bring my friends. And it turns into a big party.’

It was during his family’s 2016 Boxing Day celebrations when something happened that made Ameen sit up, take note, and think his family has the material needed to be a movie. ‘I have the exact moment on video. We’re dancing to a song called _In Her Heart_. It’s a Jamaican dance hall song, and my cousin Joshua, who is in the movie as Jermaine, is dancing it as if he’s resuscitating someone, and at that moment, I was like, “That’s how I’m starting my movie.” It’s not how I started it in the end. But it was Josh who prompted it. And I remember thinking, my life is fantastic. No matter how far I go, my career or whatever happens in my life, I’m so rich at home. I have such a wealthy home life with my family.’

For Ameen, the script was both a way to celebrate his family’s joy, as well as an opportunity to reflect his cultural and sociological background on the big screen – something he hadn’t seen before. ‘As I grew older, I was like, I really want to see something that represents how I grew up. Cause I didn’t grow up in the streets. I grew up in a middle-class background. My mum’s a psychologist, my dad’s a businessman, so I grew up very differently to what was being represented in films or TV, or what I had the opportunity to represent as an actor. And so, I was, “ want to see _my_ story.” I also come from a multicultural family, there’s Africans, Caribbean, Jamaican, Eastern Caribbean. My dad is Vincentian, my mum is Jamaican. And then there are other cultures, be it English white, that are a part of our family. We’ve got quite a mixed batch. But the thing that, ultimately, made me want to make a movie was the joy of what those parties mean to our family every year.’

And so, as Ameen sat down to write the script, he began mining his own life for characters and inspiration, drawing from ‘the diary of my life’. ‘Initially it was coming from writing from the heart, writing about my family and my experiences,’ he admits. ‘My experience of love. My experience of being British but having American girlfriends. And then my American girlfriend comes and meets the family. These are all my experiences. From a romance perspective, I don’t have an ex-girlfriend who’s a famous pop star. But I did draw from an ex-girlfriend who is a famous actress. I just played around with the truth a little bit and drew from moments of my life.’

The lead character, Melvin McKenzie, as played by Ameen, is a Londoner living in Los Angeles, who returns to London for Christmas. Unlike Ameen, Melvin is a novelist, not an actor. But the family he visits is very similar to his own. Melvin’s mother, played by Academy Award nominated actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste (_Secrets & Lies_), is named Shirley after Ameen’s grandmother; Melvin’s father, Bilal, played by his _Yardie_ co-star Robbie Gee, is named after Ameen’s own father; while Melvin’s sister Aretha, aka Boobsy, played by Tamara Lawrance (_Small Axe_), is modelled on his own sister.

‘I think the characters that are closest to the people in my life are Boobsy and Bilal. They literally draw from the real people,’ says Ameen. ‘All of the uncles and aunties are representative of actual uncles and aunties in my family. Boobsy is my pet name for my sister Aretha. My mum’s best friend is a white, English women. She was married to a Nigerian man. So, from a character perspective, I drew closely from people I know, and it was really fun.’

Significant events in Melvin’s life were also pulled from real-life but scrambled up for the benefit of the story. ‘My parents got divorced when I was like 15. They didn’t get divorced when I was an adult like Melvin’s did.’

And while the film’s structure is pure rom-com – with his character, Melvin, torn between his American girlfriend and his ex, Georgia – Ameen sprinkled into the script a lot of home truths about racism, relationships, and fatherhood, with some of the conversations drawn from real-life and some imagined, representing his worldview. ‘I’ve been writing a lot for the last ten years, and I always ground in a bit of truth about my world, my life, and the lessons I’ve learned. And often, it’s the characters I am not playing who speak more closely to how I view the world. My dad and I have never had that conversation that Melvin and Bilal have about fatherhood. So, it’s grounding the story in the truth of people and family, but also, and importantly, offering an alternative perspective on what _could_ have happened.

‘One of the most important speeches to me in the film – and it’s a rom-com, so it shouldn’t really be there – is the conversation that Shirley, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, has in the car with her white boyfriend Richard, played by Stephen Dillane, about being a woman, growing up with black children in the late eighties and nineties and what that meant,’ Ameen continues. ‘I feel in a way I am representing myself, because her kids don’t really care, cause they’re a new generation. But she is holding on to a lot of that baggage, and rightfully so, from the past. And so, to me, those conversations are important. They’re me being a writer and having my hand on my thoughts and opinions about life.’

For Leigh-Anne Pinnock, who plays Melvin’s ex, Georgia, the fact that _Boxing Day_ is the first all-black, British rom-com is hugely significant. ‘This is something that’s never been seen before, and it’s just so important to have these things on our screens,’ she says. ‘Black culture is not celebrated enough on our screens, so to be part of something that’s going to create history is incredible. And the fact we’ve got West Indian families, we’ve got African families, it’s so vibrant, it’s so beautiful, it’s so exciting.’

‘We say black rom-com, and it is, but it’s also a universal story,’ insists Ameen. ‘Everyone can relate to it, cause it’s about family and love and friendship and set at that time of year we all enjoy. It’s also a particularly British story. Because, having lived in different countries for the past decade, there’s no place like London when it comes to representing deep and dynamic multi-cultural influences.’<br>
