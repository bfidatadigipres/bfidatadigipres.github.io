_The Apartment_ may be set during the Christmas holidays but, despite its sophistication and peerless wit, it offers little in the way of festive cheer. This is a romantic comedy macerated in moral corruption and director Billy Wilder’s trademark cynicism. Inspired by the British weepie _Brief Encounter_ (1945), but transferred to mid-century Manhattan, _The Apartment_ is as much about loneliness and self-loathing as it is about love. And yet, the joy of its airtight script by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, its bittersweet score by Adolph Deutsch, and Joseph LaShelle’s gleaming monochrome widescreen cinematography make it a film to savour – not to mention the famous forced-perspective sets by Alexandre Trauner, which transform an office block into an anonymous dystopia.

Jack Lemmon plays the hapless C.C. Baxter, a desk jockey at a New York insurance firm who is so much of a loser at love that instead of enjoying flirtations of his own he lends his flat to his sleazy colleagues for their adulterous trysts. Shirley MacLaine plays Fran, the unattainable object of his affection, a charming lift operator whose heart is broken by one of those duplicitous office creeps: a callous boss played by Fred MacMurray, returning to the insurance business after his previous turn for Wilder in _Double Indemnity_ (1944). Lemmon and MacLaine make an adorable couple, two lost souls in the mean streets, but sharing an ambiguous attraction right up until the film’s famous last line.

**Cameron Crowe on Billy Wilder**  
The first Billy Wilder movie to ever grace my family’s living room was _Some Like It Hot._ I was too small to catch all the subtext of those cross-dressing musicians, but this much was clear: something was going on inside that movie. A subversive sense of humour was at play, and those big laughs rocked our house. Later, someone pointed out that the same man made _Sunset Blvd_., another movie we all watched together as a family. Both were late-night ‘movies of the week’ on TV. The magic was palpable, even on that  small screen.

I decided to become a filmmaker to protect a script I’d written called _Say Anything…_ A number of other directors had passed on it, and the script was about to fall into the hands of someone who cared a lot less about it than me. Wilder, a journalist who became a director for similar reasons, was one of the first masters I turned to in preparing to direct. Most writer-directors seeking inspiration eventually go to Wilder. I worked through his pictures one by one. His work was like a drug – character-rich stories filled with laughs and story turns so deft you could get a body rush sitting in the theatre. Eventually, I got to _The Apartment_, sadly after my father had passed away. Halfway through, it was already my favourite. When I heard the last line of the movie, ‘shut up and deal’, I realised where one of my dad’s favourite phrases had come from.

Part of the great fun of being a fan of Billy Wilder is that your favourite Wilder pictures change over the years. For me, sometimes it’s _Love in the Afternoon_; other times it’s _A Foreign Affair_; but usually I return to _The Apartment_. The characters, the score, the melancholy and the perfection of the script and performances… It’s hard to top, though the fizzy comic wallop of _Some Like It Hot_ sure gives it a run for its money.

In my experience of interviewing him, Wilder usually chose _Some Like It Hot_ or _The Apartment_ as his personal favourite. His reasons he said, were mostly script-based. He just loved the structure and the successful collaborations with his writing partner Izzy Diamond. He often mentioned the ‘cracked mirror’ scene in _The Apartment_ as one of his favourite moments in any of his films. He explained that these pictures and _Sunset Blvd._ ‘just worked’. Of his audience favourites, the only one that seemed to displease him was _Irma la Douce_. As for his favourite actors, he always mentioned Lemmon and Matthau and, with an extra twinkle, Charles Laughton.

_Double Indemnity_ survives because of its masterful victory of tone and performance and direction. For a still young director, it was a work of sly bravura. And Wilder’s favourite element – the inner ‘love story’ between Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson – gives the movie its freshness and a dark kick. Many try for this tone; few get there. Wilder used to say that a masterful comic actor like Cary Grant would forever be beaten at the Oscars by a less talented, furrow-browed serious actor with a ‘physical ailment of some kind’. It was his way, I think, of waving the flag for what he felt to be a far more difficult exercise – comedy. He was a great fan of modern pictures that had a certain graceful comic perfection, like the Japanese film _Shall We Dance?_  He also loved the deep-tissue satire of _American Beauty_. As for his own legacy, Wilder sometimes scoffed, ‘Why would anyone care about me?’  But, in fact, he’d noticed the parade of younger filmmakers who cited him and made a point of telling me it genuinely surprised and touched him. ‘A lot?’  ‘A little,’ he’d answer with a trademark flick of his eyebrow that indicated the opposite might also be true.

As Wilder once said of Audrey Hepburn, ‘there is only one’. But his lessons to other modern directors are clear: protect your script and your characters; observe the values of script structure… Take a look at the work of Wilder’s own heroes, from Ernst Lubitsch to William Wyler, and then go out there with a camera and tell your stories with glee and a ferocious lack of false sentimentality. But most of all, ‘don’t bore them’.
