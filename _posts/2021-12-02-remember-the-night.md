_‘At the studio, writing_ Remember the Night _for my new producer, Al Lewin, almost caused me to commit hara-kiri several times, but I postponed it for some later assignment… As it turned out, the picture had quite a lot of schmaltz, a good dose of schmerz and just enough schmutz to make it box office.’_ – Preston Sturges

Before becoming one of Hollywood’s first writer-directors, Preston Sturges was one of its savviest writers (the first to secure a percentage of a film’s gross). Two of his best scripts from this period – _Easy Living_ and _Remember the Night_ – were directed by Paramount comedy stalwart Mitchell Leisen, whose appreciation of Sturges’s unique voice laid some valuable groundwork for Sturges’s own firecracker career.

_Remember the Night_ is an unpredictable romantic comedy of surprising dramatic adroitness and poignancy. When shoplifter Barbara Stanwyck’s trial is adjourned, she ends up spending a cosy country Christmas with the loving family of prosecuting attorney Fred MacMurray (who made nine films with Leisen, and whose shifty amiability works well here). Romance buds but that courtroom awaits, and Sturges confidently sidesteps genre expectations, with love tempting the essentially honest lawyer towards wrongdoing, just as the criminal starts feeling that justice should be done. The leads are excellent in this warm-hearted prelude to 1944’s _Double Indemnity_, and Sturges’s knack of turning on a dime from loopy comedy (cow-milking antics and flaming wastebaskets) to straight-shooting sincerity affords _Remember the Night_ an affecting human dimension. Just 13 months after its release, Sturges was soaring, having released three films as director and bagged the first Original Screenplay Oscar.

From the outset, Preston Sturges specialised in what Peter Bogdanovich called ‘fresh, unusually vigorous scripts, which quite overpowered their directors’. Indeed, Sturges’s proudly sole-authored script deal for the heavyweight drama _The Power and the Glory_ (1933) was revolutionary, as was producer Jesse Lasky’s order to William K. Howard to shoot it verbatim. Despite its earnest playing, this time-shifting, flashback-filled tale of the ascent of Spencer Tracy’s ruthless railroad tycoon (which prefigured _Citizen Kane_) shows how versatile Sturges could be as a dramatist. So does the sparkling _Easy Living_ (1937) which gives us the flipside of a tycoon’s travails, this time as screwball comedy, pinballing adorable innocent Jean Arthur on a pavement-to-penthouse journey of misunderstandings triggered by a fallen fur coat. Director Mitchell Leisen’s elegant, overwrought aesthetic (that ornate white wonderland of an apartment) nimbly sets off Sturges’s cynical class-clash comedy, and makes the film’s sweet slapstick (an automat food-fight, Arthur and Ray Milland sliding like wet puppies around a giant, squirting bathtub) resonate.

Prominent in these 30s screenplays are themes that Sturges would go on honing into the 40s – strong, independent female leads, rags-to-riches stories with capricious benefactors, spiky social satire. Though it’s notionally a romantic comedy, _Remember the Night_ is full of unexpected genre and tonal shifts, a try-out for the bolder complications of _Sullivan’s Travels_. Barbara Stanwyck’s smart-mouthed shoplifter, dragged home for Christmas by dogged DA Fred MacMurray, displays the deftness of _The Lady Eve_’s seductive trickster. But the film blends road-trip screwball with a dark detour to her monstrous mother, and an engagingly – and uncharacteristically – warm outcome. Nonetheless, Sturges, irritated by Leisen’s ruthless pruning of his script to lend MacMurray a quiet decency, resolved to run his own show.
