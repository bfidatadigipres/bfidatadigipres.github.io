_‘A fantastic cast at the peak of their game... Jack Nicholson’s incredible wardrobe, strong female leads and let’s not forget Susan Sarandon’s hair!’_  
Eleanor Watkins, BFI Member

**Up Jumped the Devil or, The Jack in Pandora’s Box: Can ‘The Witches of Eastwick’ de-spook genre theory? Raymond Durgnat puts the case for the cross-brewing of genres**

Most prevalent genre theories assume that genres must replicate semi-rigid, largely 'pre-scribed' structures of ideas; whence problems with (1) genre hybrids, (2) distinguishing genres, topical clusters, and strings of films sharing similar ingredients, (3) surprise, innovation and change. _The Witches of Eastwick_ provides an unusually clear test case.

**The Genres of Eastwick**

It cross-breeds the following genres-or-strings (each of which overlaps with several others):

**A. Newer Genres:**  
**1. Supernatural SFX (Neo-Materialism):** Demons and (a) Female anatomy  
(_The Exorcist_, _Carrie_); (b) Apocalyptic scenery-shaking (_Ghostbusters_): _Ghostbusters_ is 3 men vs. female demon-carrier; this is ‘Devil-busters’ (3 women vs. male demon-incarnation).  
**2. Gross-Out Comedy:** With its piggish-sleazy male and cascading vomit, this = ‘National Lampoon’s Animal Coven’.  
**3. Romantic Fantasy:** Frustrated people meet Super-Being: _Splash_ (high-IQ mermaid), _Weird Science_ (computer-perfected female totem), _Cocoon_, _E.T._, _Back to the Future_. This film contrives a triple shuffle: the Super-Being is a slob, the mere humans become lightning-conducting, flying Wonder-Women, _and_ suffer a lot.  
**4. The Capitalist-Daydream Life de Luxe:** As in _Arthur_, _Trading Places_,  _The Toy_, spoiled-rotten rich brats move through palatial-domestic environments. (Premature prototype: _Cinderfella_, 1960).  
**5. Feminist Themes:** (a) As in _Nine to Five_, feminine trio dethrone unworthy male (but basically different types, settings, issues); (b) Sisterhood is strength (_The Turning Point_, _Julia_); (c) Superwoman flies out (see under 3 + _Supergirl_); (d) Liberating female sexuality: Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) looks like a handy sex-and-soul stimulus-object for female sharing.  
N.B., Situations (a) and (c) look contradictory but are compatible: this devil _seems_ amenable but _becomes_ dominant.

**B. Traditional Genres:**  
**6. Women’s Drama** (competing term, **7, Soap Opera**; **8, Melodrama**): Whichever term we adopt, can this co-genre with, for example, _Our Mother’s House_, _The Pumpkin Eater_, to name two other ‘weird maternity’ stories?  
**9. Horror Film** (in the sense of ‘Supernatural Melodrama’).  
**10. Supernatural Comedy:** _I Married a Witch_, _Bewitched_, both transparently metaphoric for secular-sex comedy.  
**11. Small-town Comedy:** After Capra’s good angel in _It’s a Wonderful Life_, this is ‘It’s a Diabolical Life’.  
**12. Comedy of Manners** (in expanded sense of ‘Comedy of Life-Style’):  
With special emphasis on Scandal/Embarrassment/Spectacular Public Humiliation/Grossly Bad Manners. The genre favours shame over guilt, generating cheerful cynicism by attributing guilt, a moral emotion, to shame, a social-power one. Three relevant subgenres: (a) Sex-War Comedy-Drama; (b) Comedy of Nervous Breakdown; (c) Comedy of Male Incoherence: Jack Nicholson’s crazy-mixed-up devil is the precise antithesis to Jerry Lewis, with some remarkably systematic ‘oppositions’ to _The Ladies’ Man_ (1962).

**C. Recurrent Themes:**  
**13. ‘Hallelujah l’m a Nut’:** (_You Can’t Take It with You_, _One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_, _Beyond Therapy_).  
**14. ‘Momism Rules Okay’:** Sensible Women vs. Sneaky Males (_Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife_, _I Was a Male War Bride_, _Some Like It Hot_).  
**15. ‘Weird Nativities’:** (_2001_, _Rosemary’s Baby_).

**Deconstructing the Devil**

**Tricky Old Nicky or, That New Devil, Inconsequence:**  
Jack Nicholson’s Van Horne = Jerry Lewis + Bill Murray (who = John Wayne + cynical slob). And what a bundle of contradictions, what a compact of incoherences, is his weirdly changing bodyshape, his crazy-quilt costumes, his corkscrewy spiel! He’s (1) ‘Your average horny little devil’ (the mere male); (2) every kind of rebel against conformity (his wardrobe is a gaudy kaleidoscope of non-grey flannel); (3) snob Old America (Dutch name); (4) vulgar millionaire; (5) plush-pad hippy; (6) Hugh Hefner-ish _Playboy_ philosopher; (7) The Spirit of Consumer Hedonism; (8) the lonely male single who needs mothering; (9) the peacefully sensuous liberated male who’d be quite happy to be a woman; (10) the Sugar-Nobodaddy bearing gifts; (11) the shame-free brat; and more yet ... He’s a whirligig of styles and norms; the confusion of Everything-Is-Permitted-If-You-Think-So. He’s the All-American Screwtape ...
