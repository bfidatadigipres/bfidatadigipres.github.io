**What’s it about?**  
When a great blizzard descends on the small town of Blackbury, home to Albert and his granny, it appears to have brought a  14-foot tall Abominable Snow Baby with it! Where the locals show fear and hostility, Albert and his granny treat the creature with respect and love, and it isn’t long before the townsfolk are forced to see the error of their ways. Terry Pratchett’s much-loved tale provides the basis for this new animated, wonderfully festive film.

**Terry Pratchett’s The Abominable Snow Baby**  
_Terry Pratchett’s The Abominable Snow Baby,_ based on one of legendary author Sir Terry’s best-selling short stories, tells the story of a quintessentially English town which is thrown into disarray by a huge snowfall and the dramatic appearance of a 14-feet tall Abominable Snow Baby. Shunned and feared by the local townsfolk, Snow Baby is rescued by an indomitable Granny who along with grandson Albert, welcomes him into her home, showering her new pet with love and affection, changing the town’s perception and helping the community overcome their initial prejudices.

Screen legend and comedy icon Julie Walters (_Harry Potter, Mamma Mia, Paddington_) will star as the voice of fearless ‘Granny’, whilst Hugh Dancy (_Black Hawk Down, Ella Enchanted, Hannibal, Downton Abbey 2_) will take on the role of her courageous grandson ‘Albert’ with narration from _Homeland_ star David Harewood (_Supergirl, Blood Diamond_).

Created with traditional hand drawn animation techniques to capture the timeless nature of  Terry Pratchett’s story, _The Abominable Snow Baby_ is part of a long and established tradition of Channel 4’s animated Christmas specials such as _The Snowman_, _The Tiger Who Came to Tea_, and last year’s _Quentin Blake’s Clown_.

Channel 4 Head of Drama, Caroline Hollick said:

‘Channel 4’s original Christmas animation has become a real highlight over the years and this year will be no exception. I’m delighted Julie Walters, Hugh Dancy and David Harewood will be bringing to life this wonderful, funny and moving yuletide tale. With this amazing cast line up I can hardly wait… it’s definitely going to be a merry Terry Christmas.’
