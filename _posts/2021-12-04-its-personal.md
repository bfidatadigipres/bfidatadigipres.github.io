**It’s Personal**  
Kyla requires 24 hour care with everything from making artwork to having a wee; struggling with a care shortage during the pandemic, she asks filmmaker friend Lou to swap cameras for catheters and learn how to assist her in a reality TV challenge. The pair give a refreshingly personal perspective of the global care crisis, the necessity of friendship and what it means to truly care for each other.

**What’s Next**  
Our pilot episode has left people wanting more, and asking for the rest of the series. The incredible response from both within the international disability community and beyond, confirmed what we already knew, that there are so many more authentic, nuanced stories to unfold and explore that can open up conversations around interdependence.

The history of TV has not encountered a more necessary and impactful call to arms to include disabled people within the industry [1], than the stirring McTaggart lecture Jack Thorne gave in July at the Edinburgh TV Festival. Jack Thorne argued that TV allows us to empathise with others, and this is why we need more disabled stories, disabled talent and disabled creators in TV at a time when the terrifying ableism and eugenics of our society have been made clear by society’s response to COVID. [2]

We want to be part of this change, making reality TV to engage and entertain. Expanding _It’s Personal_ to continue our journey and weave in more stories beyond our own. We’re looking for a production company to support making these next steps possible.
