_+ Q&A_

**Aimee Victoria** is a deaf queer love story created entirely remotely during the height of lockdown in 2020. No members of the cast or crew met in person. One of the first films to feature a relationship between two deaf women, it is an uplifting story of love and commitment.

**The Multi** tackles the impact of lifelong trauma and mental health, especially from the perspective of the black deaf female community. It was created semi-remotely with a majority deaf cast and crew. Filmed between lockdowns in early 2021, the crew were limited to ensure Covid compliance and key positions including American Sign Language interpreters joined through video conferencing.

**Mikail Chowdhury** is an Emmy nominated producer, award winning filmmaker and playwright whose work has been selected for multiple film festivals including the Oscar Qualifying Outfest LA, Reel Sisters of the Diaspora and New Orleans. His focus is on enagaging audiences and featuring underrepresented communities in front of and behind the camera. His work includes directing feature film  _The Party_ and _The Multi_, producing short films _Nimzo_, _Van Sanctuary_ and _Aimee Victoria_. He was also showrunner on short form series _The Myth of Control_.
