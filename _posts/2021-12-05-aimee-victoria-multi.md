_+ Q&A_

**Aimee Victoria** was written and produced by Mikail as part of a short form series created entirely remotely. Natasha was cast, gave a wonderful performance and they got on brilliantly so had been talking about making something together afterwards.

_Aimee Victoria_ is a deaf queer love story created entirely remotely. No members of the cast or crew met in person and it was made during the height of lockdown in 2020. It is one of the first films to feature a relationship between two deaf women and is an uplifting story of love and commitment.  We are currently developing this as a feature film.  

**The Multi** was written, produced by and stars Natasha – she wrote the script and kindly asked Mikail if he would come onboard.

_The Multi_ tackles the impact of lifelong trauma and mental health, especially from the perspective of the black deaf female community. It was created semi-remotely with a majority deaf cast and crew. Filmed in between LA County lockdowns, the numbers of crew were limited to ensure Covid compliance and key positions including American Sign Language interpreters joined the set through video conferencing. It has already been selected for a number of film festivals (including a Canadian Screen Awards Qualifier).

**Mikail Chowdhury** is a playwright, Emmy nominated producer and award winning filmmaker whose work has been selected for multiple film festivals including the Oscar Qualifying Outfest LA, Reel Sisters of the Diaspora and New Orleans. His focus is on enagaging audiences and featuring underrepresented communities in front of and behind the camera. His work includes Writing/Directing feature film  _The Party_, Producing/Directing _The Multi_, producing short films _Nimzo_, _Van Sanctuary_ and _Aimee Victoria_, and as Showrunner on the series _The Myth of Control_.

**Natasha Ofili** is an actor, writer and producer based in LA. She is the first Black Deaf women to play a character in a video game for _Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales_, starred in Netflix’s _The Politician_, Amazon Original’s _Undone_ and in the short film _Aimee Victoria_. She also wrote, produced and starred in her original film, _The Multi_. Natasha has been featured in the _LA Times_, _The Oprah Magazine_ and _TechRadar_ amongst other publications and she has a passion for storytelling and authentically representing her community. She is continuing to act and write, with plans to produce more original work.
