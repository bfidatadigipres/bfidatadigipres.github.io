**Arnaud Desplechin on ‘A Christmas Tale’**

Arnaud Desplechin’s new film _A Christmas Tale_ is another addition to the currently  burgeoning French family-drama cycle,  assembling a heavyweight cast which  includes mother and daughter Catherine  Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni,  Jean-Paul Roussillon, Mathieu Amalric and  Emmanuelle Devos, among others, for a  fraught family reunion at Christmas  in Roubaix (the provincial town where  Desplechin grew up). Junon (Deneuve)  and Abel (Roussillon) have three children,  but lost an earlier one to a rare genetic  condition. It now transpires Junon is dying  of the same disease, and only a bone  marrow transplant from one of her family  members is likely to save her. Will that  be Henri (Amalric), the feckless son  unaccountably ‘banished’ years earlier  by his solemn sister Elizabeth (Anne  Consigny), or Elizabeth’s own anguished  adolescent son Paul? Desplechin unleashes  a battery of formal devices and references  to frame the ensuing entanglements and  harsh reckonings, making _A Christmas Tale_ one of his richest works to date.

_What was the starting point for_ A Christmas Tale _?_

Often I start with things that I don’t understand intellectually, but which are good material for an actor. A while ago I was reading Emerson on the death of his child. A man in a cemetery says, ‘My son detached himself from me as a leaf falls from a tree’ – I thought, that’s good. Then in order for me to try and understand what I’m doing, I like to tell myself my film belongs to a genre.  I thought we’ll have this house, and it’ll be a Thanksgiving movie. And all these strange sentences and this material that I don’t quite understand, I’ll put into this house. Sometimes it’s a question of shape as well; in this case I thought it a good idea for the film to be structured as an Advent calendar so that all the characters are locked up in this house, and every time you open a window, it’s like a little present – a character trapped in there.

_Did you choose your music before or after shooting?_

I can’t write and put the music on it at the same time. I’ve always felt guilty about that, because of Godard’s adage that you mustn’t use music, but you must serve it, as in be useful to it. If I added music immediately, it would be clichéd. Sometimes when I’m editing, I tell my editor to take off the sound. I’m trying to work out what I meant – not what I see, but what did I film? I give the editor a record to play and suddenly I see the performance of this character. And that’s something that I love in Scorsese’s films. It seems that he too uses music to understand what he’s done.

_Why did you choose to have each character talk straight to camera?_

When the script was advanced, I wrote something a bit silly. You see Junon (Deneuve) doing her housework, and then suddenly she turns to camera and explains the set-up, saying this is my house, the whole story is going to take place here. It was as if she said, I’m the main character, you’re not obliged to look at all the others. And because the family is full of eccentric weirdos, each of them takes the spotlight to say, the others don’t matter, I am the main one. So it was an interesting competition between the characters.

_Why did you decide to build in mythic underpinnings?_

There’s a line that Mathieu’s character says (but if it weren’t Mathieu saying it, it would be a dreadful line): ‘We’re swimming deep in a myth, but I don’t know which one it is.’ It was amazing because you feel he’s very moved when he says that. And I don’t know either. I love the characters aspiring to this grandeur – but they are just in Roubaix. They have such great expectations and their lives are disasters. It’s lovely! This is what films are about.

_Was the role of Junon written especially for Catherine Deneuve?_

I can’t write for actors. If I could, it would mean that I know the character. I write characters I don’t understand and then ask actors to help me create them. With another actress, Junon’s character would be very different. I don’t want to get someone stuck, particularly if I love and respect them. I don’t want to blackmail them.

_It seems a classically subversive Deneuve role, the unsentimental mother?_

What interests her in a part is what she calls cruelty. I’m not sure I would call it that; it’s more the power of scandal, the power of subversion. It’s a question of generations, that’s the impression I have. For example, it was important for her to say the maternal instinct does not exist. It’s a very strong thing from the 1960s; it means freedom for women, to say we are allowed not to love our kids, just like men. She never crushes the part with her performance. She just looks at the whole movie and says, okay, this is what I need to give. She’s not choosing films for the sake of performing, even though she is a terrific performer.
