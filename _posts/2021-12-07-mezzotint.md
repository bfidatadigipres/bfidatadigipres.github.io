_+ Q&A with director Mark Gatiss and cast members Frances Barber, Robert Bathurst  and Nikesh Patel. Hosted by Matthew Sweet._

_‘For sale: Interesting mezzotint: View of a manor-house, early part of last century.’_

It’s 1922 and in the heart of an old English college, Edward Williams receives an engraving of an unknown country house. An imposing facade. A sweeping lawn. And, just perhaps, something else…?

Laced with M. R. James’ trademark terror, _The Mezzotint_ will guarantee a chill in the air for viewers this Christmas.

Rory Kinnear (_Years & Years_, _No Time to Die_) stars as Williams, alongside Robert Bathurst (_Cold_ _Feet_, _Downton_ _Abbey_) as Garwood, and Frances Barber (_Doctor_ _Who_, _Semi-Detached_) as  Mrs Ambrigail. _The_ _Mezzotint_ also stars John Hopkins (_Poldark_, _Lucky_ _Man_), Emma Cunniffe (_Roadkill_, _Unforgotten_), Nikesh Patel (_Four Weddings and a Funeral_, _Indian_ _Summers_), and Tommaso Di Vincenzo (_Dracula_).

_The Mezzotint_ is the latest ghost story for Christmas from Mark Gatiss on the BBC, following _Martin’s Close_ in 2019, _The Dead Room_ in 2018, _The_ _Tractate_ _Middoth_ in 2013, and _Crooked_ _House_ in 2008. All were a ratings hit, with _Martin’s Close_ becoming BBC Four’s most watched programme of 2019, with 1.5 million viewers (30-day consolidated figure).

Mark Gatiss says: ‘It’s delightful to be bringing a little seasonal unease to the nation once again and this famous M. R. James story is just the ticket. We’ve assembled a top-notch team to bring this eerie mystery – and a certain enigmatic old picture – to life.’

Piers Wenger, Director of BBC Drama, says: ‘I’m delighted that Mark Gatiss has assembled such an outstanding cast to conjure up another unmissable ghost story for BBC Two and iPlayer this Christmas. _The Mezzotint_ is classic M. R. James, and the perfect slice of horror to thrill us this festive season.’
