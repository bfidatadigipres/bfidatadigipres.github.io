_+ Q&A with actors Danielle Macdonald and Shalom  Brune-Franklin, writers/executive producers Harry & Jack Williams and  director Chris Sweeney._

From Emmy-winning and BAFTA nominated writer-producers Harry and Jack Williams (_Baptiste_, _The Missing_, _Liar_) comes this mystery-packed thriller. Jamie Dornan stars as a British man who finds himself in the glowing red heart of the Australian outback being pursued by a vast tank-truck trying to drive him off the road. An epic cat-and-mouse chase unfolds and he later wakes in hospital, hurt, but somehow alive. Except he has no idea who he is... Full of shocking, funny and brutal turns, _The Tourist_ is a story of self-discovery: as The Man starts to uncover the mystery of who he was, he’s also forced to ask who he is now, and fast – before those who are trying to kill him catch up with him.

_The Tourist_ will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 1 January.
