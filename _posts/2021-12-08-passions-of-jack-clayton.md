Join our special guests, Melanie Williams, Neil Sinyard and Elena Lazic, to explore what made Jack Clayton one of Britain’s most distinctive auteurs. In this richly illustrated event, hosted by the BFI’s James Bell, our speakers will consider Clayton’s recurring thematic preoccupations, meticulous craftsmanship, interest in literary adaptations, and unforgettable female characters. The panel will also situate his work within the broader cultural and critical contexts of British cinema and discuss his collaborations on and off-screen.
