Made with a cast of 35-year-old cowboys, soldiers or gangsters, _Battle Royale_ would be no more shocking than any other post-Peckinpah bloodbath, and many violent dystopian satires – from Peter Watkins’ _Punishment Park_ (1971) through _Turkey Shoot_ (1981) and _No Escape_ (1994) to _Series 7: The Contenders_ (2001) – have covered roughly the same ground. In this case, however, the kill-or-be-killed situation is Battle Royale, a game backed by a Japanese government of the near future, in which a group of schoolchildren are left on an island and given three days to try to kill each other off.

Making the most out of a premise which casts schoolchildren in their mid-teens as killers or victims, _Battle Royale_ demonstrates that it is still possible to be transgressive, as roughly 40 uniformed, apparently ordinary kids are murdered in familiar, blood-bursting action-picture manner – riddled with bullets from automatic weapons, throats slashed or blasted out, stabbed, shot with arrows, decapitated with a samurai sword, blown up, gruesomely poisoned.

As in _Lord of the Flies_, an obvious precedent, we are in the territory of allegory rather than a study of real-world child violence. The teenagers of Class B do not represent the likes of the Littleton, Colorado trenchcoat mafia, the killers of Jamie Bulger or genocidal teenage Khmer Rouge soldiers. Instead they are ordinary kids, representing people we are or might be, and their actions in extraordinary circumstances are supposed to expose the range of human behaviour on the edge of societal madness.

The film balances its minx-cum-sociopath and hacker-terrorist with kids who refuse to accept what is going on or simply hide out and hope it’ll all go away. A US movie like _The Hills Have Eyes_ (1977) posits that we would all become murderers if threatened with murder, but this Japanese film insists that sometimes we would choose to die rather than kill.

The Koshun Takami novel on which the film is based isn’t set in the future, but an alternative present (like Stephen King’s somewhat similar book _The Long Walk_ and the often-misinterpreted _Series 7_), predicated on a Japanese victory in World War II that has created a society in which Battle Royale seems to make sense.

The script skips over the set up, with some statistics about unemployment and kid crime that don’t sink in, and then delivers a few preliminary jabs, as narrator Shuya comes home to find his unemployed father has committed suicide and soon-to-be killed tearaway Nobu stabs apparently sympathetic teacher Kitano in the school hallway. Then, on the bus as they are supposedly taken on a school trip, we meet the class who have been selected for this cruel contest, and it is established that they are neither particularly innocent nor especially deserving of this punishment. Nobu, the only guilty party, is killed off quickly, and the chill sets in.

Most other films in this sub-genre are primarily satires at the expense of crass media. This is not an avenue _Battle Royale_ chooses to explore – although we do get a hideous moment as a bloodied little girl with braces and a Norman Bates smile is hailed as a celebrity for surviving the last BR, and there is an hilariously perky instructional video for mass murder presented by a pouting Japanese MTV-type hostess.

Though monitored by the game officials, and a sad-eyed but brutalised ‘Beat’ Takeshi (who plays former teacher Kitano), the kids are on their own. An especially horrific aspect of the premise is that the point of BR is not to entertain sadistic mobs, but to teach children a lesson.

The film keeps count of who has died, with print-outs on screen and regular announcements, but with so many characters it can’t get close to them all. The obvious central figures, meek Noriko and numb Shuya, are less vivid than some of the shorter-lived characters and the most effective moments in the film are vignettes: the take-charge head-girl type cheerfully organising her clique to survive, only for everything to go wrong as girls with ordinary grievances (‘Why do you have to be the leader alI the time?’) reach for guns; contrasting moments as boys approach girls on whom they have crushes, with one trying to bully a girl into liking him through death threats and another being shot dead by the girl he has just confessed his love to; the revelation that Kiriyama, sporting a sharp suit and Johnny Rotten hair, has entered the contest for fun; sickle-wielding Mitsuko’s assumption of the role of serial murderess, paying back all the real and imaginary sleights she has suffered in school (‘I didn’t want to be a loser any more’).

Perhaps because it’s impossible to rationalise the situation as credible, and perhaps because taking it deadly seriously would make the film unwatchably grim, veteran director Kenji Fukasaku mines a seam of very black humour, with the wry, impassive, hard-to-fathom Kitano acting as if this were a normal school activity, as classical music is played over the Tannoy and updates on the classes’ progress are read out.

As the scrambling of character name and actor suggests, Kitano is our anchor in this picture, a familiar presence with an inimitable stance, and his poised, perfect death scene tells us that we must take _Battle Royale_ seriously but not literally.<br>
