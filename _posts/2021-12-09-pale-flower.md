Fresh out of a stretch in prison, ageing yakuza Muraki (Ryo Ikebe) returns to an underworld he barely recognises. He becomes romantically entangled with the mysterious, beautiful Saeko (Mariko Kaga) at a gambling den, but will she save him or lead him further down a dangerous path? Aching with stylish, existential cool, Shinoda’s _noir_ breakthrough is a vital film of the New Wave.<br>
**bfi.org.uk**<br>

A super-cool black orchid of a Japanese noir, Shinoda’s seminal yakuza saga is now a revered classic among Nipponophiles but is far less known in the west, where the historical milieu of Shinoda’s fatalistic _Double Suicide_ (1969) more suited the middle-class appetite. _Pale Flower_ also initiated a new genre – the _bakuto-eiga_, or gambling film – but every fibre of the movie, thematic and visual, delivers an existential blast of modern doom, as rich and pure as a Coltrane saxophone wail. Right here, it seems, Japan inherited the authentic _noir_ gene from US films, as if its culture demanded it like none other. (But, at the same time, 1964 may have been the nation’s new wave golden year, with landmark work coming from Teshigahara, Imamura, Shindo, Kobayashi, Masumura etc.)

Muraki (Ikebe Ryo) is a hitman who, returning to Tokyo and its gambling dens after doing time for a mob killing, immediately lays eyes on Saeko (Kaga Mariko), a doll-faced waif addicted to cards and generally pining for mindless thrills. Shinoda’s story (co-written with Baba Ataru) is the duo’s slow dance through losses and wins and yakuza politics towards each other, conjoining in a dangerous _pas de deux_ mediated by suicidal risk and mutual nihilism.

Shinoda’s achievement, though, is less psychological than cultural – the film seems to intend its own iconic thrust, and every extraordinary Shochiku Grandscope shot is a vision of post-war Japan as a dark underworld corridor seething with secrets and moral emptiness. It’s a movie of rash, savage contrasts – within the images and between them, dialectic-style and the details are haunting, from the rattle of the shuffling _hanafuda_ cards to the ticking clocks filling the flat of Muraki’s ex-girlfriend to Saeko’s unfashionably fashionable 1960s accoutrements, the moneyed accessories of a bruised, death-seeking femme who remains as much a mystery to us as she does to Muraki. (He has killed, he explains, ‘to survive’, without realising that survival is exactly what interests Saeko least.) Mention should be made too of Toru Takemitsu’s wild score, which bubbles under the action like a crankjagged jazz orchestra playing from hell.

As the movie rolls inexorably towards its date with hopelessness and death, which is another mob hit performed in a crowded room with a huge knife and scored to an opera aria (the composition of this scene, Chuck Stephens maintains in his essay, explicitly recalls the 1960 assassination of socialist politician Asanuma Inejiro, caught on television during a rally), _Pale Flower_ becomes a film that crystallises a generational moment, without excess or irony.<br>
