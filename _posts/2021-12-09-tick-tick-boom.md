_+ pre-recorded Q&A with director Lin-Manuel Miranda, producer Julie Oh, executive producer Julie Larson, writer Steven Levenson and actors Andrew Garfield, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus and Judith Light_

Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda’s adaptation of _tick, tick...BOOM!_ has been a long time in the making.

The new film, featuring an all-star cast led by Academy Award-nominee and Tony Award-winner Andrew Garfield as Jonathan Larson, centres on the then-upstart composer and playwright as he attempts to create a musical theatre masterpiece. Larson wrote the original _tick, tick...BOOM!_ at the same time he was putting the finishing touches on the show that would come to dominate the New York stage in the 1990s and beyond: _RENT_.

_tick, tick...BOOM!_ also stars Alexandra Shipp (_Love, Simon, X-Men: Apocalypse_) as Larson’s dancer girlfriend Susan, and Robin de Jesús (_In the Heights_) as best friend Michael. As the friends traverse their artistic careers and major life decisions, they confront the AIDS crisis in its height, much as Larson did in his Pulitzer Prize-winning _RENT._ ‘Suddenly you were seeing people who had never been on a Broadway stage before; queer people, people of colour,’ says screenwriter Steven Levenson (_Dear Evan Hansen_).

Although Larson didn’t live to see the success of either production – he died from an aortic aneurysm the morning of _RENT_’s Off Broadway premiere – his work influenced an entire generation of aspiring stage performers, Miranda among them. The New York native saw _tick, tick...BOOM!_ as a 21-year-old theatre major and later caught producer Julie Oh’s attention playing Jon in a production of _tick, tick...BOOM!_ just a year before his landmark _Hamilton_ debuted on Broadway.

Miranda’s debut skilfully weaves on-stage performance with scenes of Larson’s life, paying full tribute to the musical genius. As _LA Times’_ Justin Chang puts it, ‘_tick, tick...BOOM!_ feels refreshingly intimate and specific, idealistic but rarely naive, and grounded in a way that gives an unexpected lift to its flights of fancy.’  
**Brookie McIlvaine, Netflix production notes**

The three most significant men in modern American musical theatre, Stephen Sondheim, Jonathan Larson and Lin Manuel Miranda are all present in _tick, tick…BOOM!_ All three redefined the art form, but the tragedy of Larson is that he died before he saw his work achieve notoriety.

_tick, tick…BOOM!_ is set five years before Larson’s death, as his thirtieth birthday and the workshop of his musical _Superbia_ looms. Jonathan is living in a run-down apartment, ignored by his agent, working at a diner and trying to write the song the emotional arc of _Superbia_ depends on. Despite the setbacks, Jonathan believes in his own talent. He’s buoyed by brief encouragement from Stephen Sondheim, and introduces himself at parties as ‘the future of musical theatre’.

Directed here by Lin-Manuel Miranda, _tick, tick…BOOM!_ was originally conceived by Larson himself as an autobiographical one man show. After his death, the production was revived as a three-hander, bringing in his best friend and girlfriend as characters. In the film version, Miranda cuts between a stage performance of the songs with singers Karessa (Vanessa Hudgens) and Roger (Joshua Henry) to a cinematic retelling of events with Larson’s girlfriend Susan (Alexandra Shipp) and best friend Michael (Robin de Jesús).

As the film’s title card informs us, ‘Everything you are about to see is true, aside from the bits Jonathan made up.’ Andrew Garfield has a gargantuan task in the role of Larson: singing, dancing, appearing in almost every frame. His performance is pitched perfectly, even when the film’s energy and editing borders on chaos, Garfield remains a transfixing presence. In the spirit of Larson, Miranda’s direction explores the full potential of the musical, employing everything from stripped back acapella to glitzy multi-dimensional set pieces with dozens of voices in harmony.

Miranda’s tribute to Larson is as devastating as it is exuberant. Even the most upbeat of musical numbers are haunted by the spectre of death. Jonathan lost three friends to AIDS and the ‘tick, tick, tick’ he wrote about hearing – his sense that he was running out of time – was prophetic. After being immersed in Larson’s talent and struggles, the devastation sets in when, exhausted, Jonathan tells his friends he ‘doesn’t have five more years’ in him. It’s made all the worse to remember he had less than six.
