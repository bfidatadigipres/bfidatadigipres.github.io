_+ intro by season co-programmer Alexander Jacoby (Saturday 12 December only)_

Kôhei Oguri’s debut is a deliberately nostalgic evocation of the world of classical filmmakers such as Ozu and Shimizu. Set in Osaka in 1956 and beautifully shot in monochrome by Shôhei Andô, _Muddy River_ subtly dramatises a childhood friendship in a working-class milieu. This delicate work secured an Oscar® nomination for Best Foreign Film and propelled the career of one of the most uncompromisingly independent of modern Japanese filmmakers.<br>
**bfi.org.uk**<br>

Made independently, and taken up for Japanese distribution only after a series of special previews, _Muddy River_ is a plucky attempt to reactivate the well-known _shomingeki_ genre (dramas of everyday people) made internationally famous by Ozu, Naruse, Gosho, Shimazu and others. Although not up to these standards, this first feature reveals a sensitive cinematic imagination and a plain narrative style which is never in danger of inflating its material.

Shooting in sharp black-and-white, Oguri economically situates his characters in a lived-in environment – the hot, crowded little restaurant and the sleazy river bank with its mysterious houseboat moored on the mud. The film’s viewpoint veers intriguingly between the children and their elders – we share the children’s secrets and games (both boys are good except for some excessively winsome smiles) and learn with the adults that Kiichi’s mother is a prostitute, who sets sail again when discovered by Nobuo (a fact not entirely clear to the boy himself).

Structured almost as a series of vignettes, some scenes (such as the children’s supper party) have a quietly effective resonance, while others (the visit to the dying first wife) are somewhat sentimentalised. Over all, hangs the shadow of an economically debilitated post-war Japan still troubled by the scars and sacrifices of the Second World War. Just as confident is Oguri’s eye for the right set-up (usually static, with the camera some distance from the action), with the cutting tempo slowly increased and more camera movement introduced in the film’s moving coda, as Nobuo rushes along streets and the river bank in pursuit of the friends now disappearing from his life. In this finale, character and setting are brought together in the film’s most complete statement of an underlying concern with experience lost and found.<br>
