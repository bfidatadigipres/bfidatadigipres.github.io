Our regular Philosophical Screens series, which explores cinema through a philosophical lens, returns this month with a focus on one of the most genre-bending films about noodles. Join our regular film philosophers Lucy Bolton and Catherine Wheatley, as well as guest speaker Victor Fan of King’s College London, to consider the film’s themes of pleasure, self-perfection and tradition.<br>

**Speakers**<br>

**Victor Fan** graduated with a PhD from the Film Studies Programme and the Comparative Literature Department of Yale University, and an MFA in Film and Television Productions at School of Cinema-Television (now School of Cinematic Arts), University of Southern California. Prior to his position at King’s, he was Assistant Professor at the Department of East Asian Studies, McGill University. He is the author of _Cinema Approaching Reality: Locating Chinese Film Theory_ (University of Minnesota Press, 2015) and _Extraterritoriality: Locating Hong Kong Cinema and Media_ (Edinburgh University Press, 2019). His forthcoming monograph, _Cinema Illuminating Reality: Media Philosophy through Buddhism,_ will be published by the University of Minnesota Press in 2022.

Fan’s articles have been published in peer-review journals including _Journal of Cinema and Media,_ _Asian Cinema,_ _World Picture Journal, Camera Obscura, Journal of Chinese Cinemas, Screen, Film History: An International Journal, CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, 24 Images: Cinéma, Dianying yishu_ [_Film Art_], _Zihua_ [_Zifaa_ or Word blossoms], _Siyi,_ and many edited volumes. His film _The Well_ was an official selection of the São Paolo International Film Festival; it was also screened at the Anthology Film Archives, the Japan Society, and the George Eastman House.

Besides his academic career, Fan also worked with film festivals in Europe and Asia.

Fan is a classically trained musician and a working composer. He was a performance artist with his own theatre company Post [ET]2! in Hong Kong between 1993 and 1996. He also worked as a freelance sound editor, film composer, and re-recording mixer. He worked at Fissionarts (Los Angeles) and Solar Film/Video Productions (NYC) between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s.  In New York, he also wrote for the magazines _Film Festival Reporter_ and _Film Festival Today_, covering news from the MIX Festival, the New York Underground Film Festival, the African Diaspora Film Festival and MOXIE Film.<br>

**Catherine Wheatley** is Reader in Film and Visual Culture at King’s College London. Her books include _Stanley Cavell and Film: Scepticism and Self-Reliance at the Cinema, Michael Haneke’s Cinema: The Ethic of the Image_, the BFI Film Classics book on _Caché_, and, with Lucy Mazdon, _Sex, Art and Cinephilia: French Cinema in Britain._ Catherine also writes regularly for _Sight and Sound_ magazine.<br>
