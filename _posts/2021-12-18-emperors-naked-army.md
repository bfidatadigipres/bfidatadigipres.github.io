It is tempting to annex _The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On_ to Shohei Imamura’s filmography. Imamura suggested the project in the first place, and effected Kazuo Hara’s introduction to Kenzo Okuzaki. The resulting film, moreover, has a clear family relationship with Imamura’s own documentaries  _In Search of Unreturned Soldiers_ (_Mikikan-hei o Otte_, 1971) and _Karayuki-san, the Making of a Prostitute_ (_Karayuki-san_, 1975), both of which deal with spiritual ‘casualties’ of the Pacific War: the soldiers and prostitutes sent into South-East Asia in the 1930s who decided to stay there after the war. On the other hand, Kazuo Hara (who met Imamura when he worked as assistant cameraman on _Vengeance Is Mine_ and _Eijanaika_) made his name as an independent filmmaker with _My Intimate Eros: Love Song 1974_ (_Gokushiteki Eros: Koi-Uta 1974_), which also deals with a tireless and obsessive quest: the director’s own for the pregnant girlfriend who has left him. The bizarre figure of Okuzaki evidently served to reconcile Imamura’s interest in unhealed wounds from the war years with Hara’s interest in _cinéma vérité_ as a form of assault and battery.

Okuzaki is certainly a ‘fringe’ figure, although whether or not he belongs in the _lunatic_ fringe where British reviewers of the film have cheerfully placed him is debatable. He has no clear political alignment: he co-opts the rhetoric of the radical Right (the words ‘shin-gun’ – ‘sacred army’ or ‘divine crusade’ – are painted on the boot of his car), but uses it to attack the Emperor; and he forms an alliance with a left-wing anarchist like Eizaburo Oshima, but has no truck with the persons or the policies of the Marxist Left. His obsessive drive and his openly admitted propensity for violence both spring from his wartime experiences as a soldier. At one moment, haranguing the mouse-like Kichitaro Yamada, he castigates himself for wasting the immediate post-war years on visits to brothels and his first prison term for manslaughter; at the next, he congratulates himself on his own righteous indignation and moral probity. The contradictions are legion: he ‘doorsteps’ his interviewees at the crack of dawn to take them unawares, but conducts his actual interrogations with quintessentially Japanese courtesy – unless, of course, the interviewee is discourteous or evasive, in which case Okuzaki threatens or commits violence and pre-empts his victim by calling the police himself.

The aspect of Okuzaki’s quest that brings his sanity into question emerges only as the truth begins to come out. Okuzaki is outraged that fellow soldiers were executed on trumped-up charges in September 1945, nearly a month after the formal end of the war. When it becomes clear, however, that the men’s actual crimes were considerably worse than anything listed in the official record, Okuzaki’s anger is in no way diminished. The dead men’s relatives withdraw from the quest as the truth becomes clear, although Rinko Sakimoto consoles herself with the speculation that her brother was shot to prevent him from testifying against other cannibals in the army, and not as punishment for eating human flesh himself. Okuzaki is interested enough in the question of cannibalism to persevere with enquiries into the distinction between ‘white pork’ and ‘black pork’ (the latter was rarer, apparently, because New Guinea natives were more adept at fleeing through the jungle), but it never occurs to him that the crime of cannibalism may have justified the punishment of execution, no matter what face-saving excuse was entered on the charge sheet. For Okuzaki, cannibalism is seemingly just one more horror of the war, for which Emperor Hirohito is ultimately responsible. The immediate object of the ‘divine crusade’ is to scourge those officers who carried out the executions and have been lying (to themselves and others) about them ever since.

Whether this is rational or not, Okuzaki’s barnstorming style makes him an ideal subject for a _cinéma vérité_ documentary. Unlike Imamura, who appears in his own investigative documentaries as an on-screen participant in the process of discovery, Hara stays behind the camera. But there is never the least risk that the film will degenerate into Wiseman-style ‘fly-on-the-wall’ filmmaking because Okuzaki himself so gleefully co-opts the camera crew into his own armoury of weapons against his interviewees. Okuzaki’s tactics are inherently theatrical, and it seems highly unlikely that anything would have happened differently if Hara had not been there to photograph it. What is more measureable is Hara’s skill in choosing vantage points to record Okuzaki’s encounters, and in editing the results to lend pace and structure to Okuzaki’s rambling quest. Given the contradictory and duplicitous nature of so much of the verbal evidence, Hara manages to bring the issues into focus with astonishing clarity.

Partly, as befits a documentary of this sort, this is a matter of distance. The real subject of _The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On_ is Kenzo Okuzaki himself, not the revelations about cannibalism in 1945. Hara uses Okuzaki’s enquiries as a pretext for giving his portrait a ‘dramatic’ shape, but it remains a portrait for all that. Okuzaki commands attention not as a freak who may or may not be deranged, but as a man whose attitudes and actions express much that is repressed in Japanese society. He stands against all the bulwarks of conservative Japan – the Emperor, patriotism, family values – but does so from the perspective of a common man concerned for the fate of his fellow common men. In his way, Okuzaki is a real-life equivalent of one of Imamura’s fictional peasant characters: disrespectful of ‘authority’ but driven by a sense of higher laws and values. Hara’s camera consistently finds the optimum distance between engagement and detachment, allowing the central portrait to take shape in more than two dimensions. Okuzaki’s performance may not be expertly judged, but Hara’s is.<br>
