This was Jack Clayton’s last film, his first comedy, and his most critically acclaimed work since his sensational 1959 feature-film debut, _Room at the Top_. That same year, Muriel Spark had published _Memento Mori_, which Clayton had read and resolved someday to film. Finally encouraged by the success of _Driving Miss Daisy_ (1989), which proved that the theme of old age need not be box-office poison, Clayton offered the project to the BBC. In turn encouraged by the theatrical success of its own television films such as _Truly Madly Deeply_ (1990) and _Enchanted April_ (1991), the Corporation accepted. _Memento Mori_ was shown at festivals worldwide, and won several prestigious awards, including the screenplay award from the Writers Guild of Great Britain.

The film’s assurance comes from Clayton’s empathy with the theme. Having lost friends during his RAF experience in the war, he genuinely felt that people should remember the inevitability of death, for it would stimulate an appetite for life. Although given a schedule and budget more restricted than he was used to, he seems in his element, and there is an abundance of cinematic expertise on display: for example, the moment when Mrs Pettigrew enters the room to interrupt a conversation between Charmian and Mortimer, and the subtle framing signals a shift in the balance of power; or the battle of wills over Charmian’s medication between her and Mrs Pettigrew, where the camera focuses on the latter’s painted nails as she does a sinister finger-ballet over the pills like a spider enticing a victim into its web.

Producer Louis Marks calculated that the cast had about a thousand years’ worth of acting experience between them, and the performances of, for example, Michael Hordern, Maggie Smith, John Wood, Renée Asherson, Thora Hird and Stephanie Cole are outstanding. Georges Delerue’s score (sadly, his last before his death) is perfectly attuned to the film’s contrasting moods. Indeed, while respecting the novel’s macabre tone, Clayton brings an additional perspective that, without sentimentality, understands and accepts human foible and folly. There is snobbery, greed, even violence here, but also a humorous and humane observation of disappointed lives, and the way the ravages of time can reduce crotchety adults to behaving like spiteful children. _Memento Mori_ has something of the mellow maturity that distinguished another great film about ageing, _The Dead_ (1987), by Clayton’s mentor, John Huston.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
Jack Clayton has wanted to ﬁlm Muriel Spark’s novel since it was ﬁrst published in 1959, and had Maggie Smith in mind for the project since she ﬁrst worked with him in 1964. The intervening delay has been unusual even for a director with a reputation for pausing between ﬁlms, but according to Clayton it was not until _Driving Miss Daisy_ established a compatibility between old age and the box ofﬁce that he was at last able to make some headway. First offers came from Hollywood, but he wanted to preserve the unequivocally English spirit of the piece; the BBC was ﬁnally the answer, resulting in Clayton’s ﬁrst ﬁlm for television. Ironically, he made _Memento Mori_ after turning 70, the age at which, according to one of the elders of the story, ‘you become one of us.’

The unexpected pleasure of the ﬁlm is that Clayton has made it as an affectionate comedy. The established Clayton theme, not exactly a laughing matter, offers a baleful collusion between women on the verge of nervous breakdown and children on the verge of excessive enlightenment, and extends across the years from _The Innocents_ to _The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne_. But aside from its lightness of touch, _Memento Mori_ is remarkably consistent with those dark carnivals, another reﬂection on a bright age overtaken by autumn, another outcry on behalf of lives that have achieved too little and must now exhaust their strength in the losing battle against decay.

Amid the many one-liners transferred intact from the novel and delivered with relish by the cast, Clayton has interestingly added (along with some more outrageous interpolations of his own) several careful references that set his toddling pensioners, clumsy and querulous as children, apart from the ‘present’ (a lightly sketched London of the 1950s). They have, comments one observer, ‘a sort of stubborn gallantry, with echoes of a romantic and glamorous past’. There is also, in Clayton’s emphasis, a gulf between the plight of the servant class, the stoical grannies brightly making the best of their regimented public ward, and that of their former employers, increasingly vulnerable and ridiculous in their attempt to keep up appearances.

The real Joke, as they comment to each other, is that their youth was anything but gallant or glamorous, but consisted of unmeasured adventure, indulgence and betrayal. Prompted by the anonymous phone calls to reassess the span of their lives, they look for past achievements and ﬁnd little reward in what they were and what they have become. While avoiding the banality of measuring the years in degrees of friendship, _Memento Mori_ suggests that a primary defence against endless reminders of mortality is the savouring of continuity: the life-affirming feud, for example, between the poet Mannering and his mild critic Guy Leet (é-lite?), the secret affair between the petulantly haunted Godfrey and the departed Lisa Brooke (resurrected, perhaps, as the compliant Olive), the unswerving loyalty between Charmian and Jean Taylor, her companion of many summers.

With its central thread of rather spurious mystery, its gently faded furnishings and its subtle anachronisms of costume, the story could be an Agatha Christie pastiche were it not that the participants each have secrets of their own and constantly spring surprises on each other. ‘Your most endearing quality,’ Charmian tells Godfrey at the end, when by rights all cards should be on the table, ‘is that you don’t know me at all.’ Filmed with a spectacular economy of effect and movement, _Memento Mori_ keeps visual comment to a minimum. Clayton heralds the entire drama with a neat dissolve from the stopped pendulum of the opening credits to a telephone dial, and there is a tiny episode with a nurse, a rose and white curtains around a hospital bed that eloquently paraphrases several pages of the original text. Otherwise, the director lets his cast carry the load, supported by one of Georges Delerue’s last compositions, a charming and delicate memorial.

A wonderful band of pseudo-ancients, disdainfully steered by Maggie Smith with a scathing repertoire of sniffs, groans and glances, these gleeful veterans exploit an array of familiar eccentricities to ruthless advantage. Stephanie Cole, in ferocious hats, again waits chin ﬁrst for God, and the superb Thora Hird seems always on the point of introducing a favourite hymn, while Michael Hordern, Maurice Denham and Cyril Cusack bluster, grumble and argue in the accustomed manner of the past half century. That the culprit of the piece turns out to be Death itself is a little hard to take, particularly in that the voices on the phone are heard by all of us. But after the riotous tea party has crashed to a close, it is no problem to agree with Clayton that the insistent calls from the dark can be ignored for a good while yet.<br>
