Despite having a wife, a daughter and a successful career, Shohei Sugiyama (Yakusho) is depressed. But the sight of a beautiful woman through a window inspires him to embrace a new hobby: ballroom dancing. This delightful comedy proved a huge international hit, and ultimately spawned a Hollywood remake starring Richard Gere. The charm and flair of the original, however, remain unsurpassed.<br>

References to _Shall We Dance?_ as ‘a Japanese _Strictly Ballroom_’  are misleading – all the two ﬁlms really have in common is their fascination with the arcane conventions of ballroom dancing. Where Baz Luhrmann’s _tour de force_ was all Cuban heels, embroidered bolero jackets and brash Aussie extroversion, Masayuki Suo’s comedy – which has become the highest-grossing Japanese ﬁlm ever in the US – is sober suits and acute social embarrassment. As the introductory voice-over (in English) explains, in a country ‘where married couples don’t go out arm in arm, much less say “I love you” in public’, ballroom dancing has taken on the allure of a secret vice. What to most British – or indeed Australians – seems absurdly old-fashioned in its formality looks daring in a society where public physical contact is taboo.

In some ways _Shall We Dance?_ has more in common with Fridrik Thor Fridriksson’s _Cold Fever,_ where a bemused Japanese visitor encounters alien mores in Iceland. As with _Cold Fever,_ much of the humour in Suo’s ﬁlm derives from the anomalies of culture clash, the attempt by members of one highly coded society to lock on to patterns laid down by another, one no less coded but by quite different assumptions. ‘It’s a British sport, after all,’ muses the watching detective when a stylish but inconsiderate pair of contestants are marked down for ‘ungentlemanly attitude’. Part of the perilous attraction of culture clash is the chance it offers to switch personalities under cover of the alien culture: not so much a ﬁsh out of water as a much more colourful ﬁsh in different water. The ﬁlm is all but stolen by Naoto Takenaka’s bravura performance as Aoki, transmuting himself from shy, despised ofﬁce drudge into Danny Aoki the Latin American dance demon, launching into a ferocious rumba with ﬂashing teeth and black shag-pile wig.

Aoki’s extravagant double act serves as a burlesque variant of the transformation experienced by Shohei – drawn out of himself, learning to let go, but only fully liberated once he’s renounced his hopeless passion for the graceful Mai and begun to love dance for its own sake. Though even then he’s too embarrassed to tell his wife what he’s doing, let alone invite her to join him at the classes, while she in turn is too embarrassed to ask questions, and assumes he’s having an affair. (As indeed he is, but with dance.) For all the genuine affection between them, they spend most of the ﬁlm hopelessly out of step. It takes their daughter, more forthright and less inhibited than her parents, to persuade them to make the obvious move and dance together. The responsiveness to one’s partner Shohei has learnt on the danceﬂoor can at last be applied to his marriage.

As well as two previous features, Suo has directed documentaries on Juzo Itami (director of _Death Japanese Style_ and _Tampopo_).  The afﬁnity is evident: Suo shares Itami’s fascination with the Japanese concern for social ritual, the fear of becoming conspicuous by failing to do the right thing. He also shares Itami’s generosity towards his characters. There are no villains in _Shall We Dance?,_ and its sense of the ridiculous never precludes sympathy. This is a warm, immensely likeable ﬁlm. And besides, how can you resist a movie where the ultimate in exoticism and sophistication is represented by Blackpool?<br>
