After completing his film _The Post_, Spielberg felt the moment was right to embark on _West Side Story_. Although it was still very much in the planning stage, the director’s vision was cohering: a fresh, original, unique perspective on the material.

‘We needed to discover our voice so that [the new film] would be the same but distinctly different. We didn’t want to fix what wasn’t broken, but we did want to justify why we were telling the story again,’ Spielberg says. ‘Part of that is the cast. On stage the actors have largely not been Hispanic, and in the 1961 movie they’re in their thirties, and many who were portraying the Puerto Ricans are white. I wanted to cast it authentically, to ensure that the actors playing the Shark boys and girls were one hundred percent Latinx, and young.’

The director also wanted to make clear in the film the context and landscape in which these rival gangs endured. ‘The same wrecking ball was obliterating the turf of each fact on, entire neighbourhoods being torn down, populations being displaced. All of these kids – Jets and Sharks – were subjected to that upheaval. These kids are fighting for territory that’s disappearing before their eyes.’

This was an issue the filmmakers would emphasise in their new version, even if, as Spielberg notes, it only increased the enmity between the gangs. Screenplayer Tony Kushner, on the same page, dove into the project with immense enthusiasm, conducting research into the background of the story, especially the destruction of an entire section of the Upper West Side.

The action of the new film occurs in the summer of 1957 on the streets of adjoining Upper West Side neighbourhoods, Lincoln Square and San Juan Hill. Together the neighbourhood encompasses the area west of Broadway from West 60th Street to West 70th Street to the very edge of the city at the Hudson River.

In the early 1950s, Robert Moses – the New York City Commissioner for Public Works – razed the entire stretch of land for the construction of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Fordham University, among other projects.

At the time, Lincoln Square was populated by the descendants of peoples who had immigrated to the U.S. during the 19th century, mostly from Europe. The residents of San Juan Hill were for the most part Puerto Ricans who were part of the mass migration from the territory to New York in the wake of World War II. The destruction of the neighbourhoods drove most of the area’s inhabitants from their homes. Mostly the city relocated descendants of the early immigrants from Europe, as well as the recent Hispanic arrivals, elsewhere.

The displacement of these populations and its impact on the neighbourhoods form a crucial element of Kushner’s screenplay. He describes the area at the start of the film as ‘a vast wasteland of rubble, demolished and partially demolished tenements, crisscrossed by streets, all the way to the Hudson River.’

Faithful to Laurents’ original libretto, and with the blessings of David Saint, the Leonard Bernstein estate, the Robbins estate and Stephen Sondheim, Kushner dug deep into not only the history of the destruction of Lincoln Square and San Juan Hill but also how it would affect the characters in _West Side Story_. In his retelling, Kushner portrays each character in the story as multi-dimensional with individual backstories that motivate their actions.

Kushner says, ‘The story is both big and political, yet at its heart it’s as private and personal as can be, two young people who fall fiercely in love; but the love that blossoms between them is murdered by the big political world surrounding them. The story is a warning: racism and nativism and poverty are democracy’s antitheses, and if not resisted and rejected they will atomize the bonds that hold us together as a society. Love, as they say, is the answer – love can transform the world, it can transform malevolent reality, but love doesn’t conquer all, or at least not all threats in the immediate moment. In a context of hatred, love is in danger. And that is tragic, that’s the tragedy of _West Side Story_.’

This is one production I never wanted to see end,’ Spielberg says. ‘I had the greatest time making _West Side Story_. The last time I had a great time making a movie to this level was _E.T._ in 1981, and that movie certainly put in my head fatherhood and all sorts of things I never contemplated. Maybe this movie put in my head musicals and things I always have contemplated but until this time had never really had the courage to do.

‘The message of _West Side Story_ is what is going to live forever. It is even more timely today than it was in 1957, when they mounted the production on Broadway. Even more timely than it was with the film in ’61-’62. What it’s about is what we are living in this country today – a time of tragic division and distrust, and the waste of human life through violence, racism and xenophobia. And even though the story is a tragedy, like all great tragedies, including _Romeo and Juliet_, _West Side Story_ suggests that hope can be born amid devastation and despair, and thanks to Bernstein’s and Sondheim’s score, there’s a feeling that despite all the sorrow and ugliness, love transcends. So don’t ever give up! That’s why I wanted to tell this story right now. It is even more about now than it was about then.

‘This has been a journey without precedence: a joyful, stunningly moving, endlessly surprising encounter with the story and the score of one of the world’s greatest musicals. My brilliantly talented, fiercely committed, generous and apparently inexhaustible cast and crew of hundreds have given our film everything they’ve got, and already I can say that the film owes everything to them, as does its immensely grateful director.

‘And while I’m on the subject of gratitude: on every day of the past four years during which we’ve been preparing, casting, imagining _West Side Story_, I, and my team, cast and crew have been walking in the footsteps of four giants: Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, Jerome Robbins and Stephen Sondheim. For the light they’d shed on the world, for Stephen Sondheim’ insight, guidance and support, and for the openhearted support of the Bernstein, Laurents and Robbins estates, I owe them more than I can possibly express.’
