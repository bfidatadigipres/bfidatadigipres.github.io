Truffaut greatly admired Ophuls and called this ‘an incredibly beautiful adaptation’ of Stefan Zweig’s story about a concert pianist (Jourdan) who receives a letter relating how the author developed a crush on him as a teenager, only to become – briefly – one of his seemingly countless sexual conquests some years later. Poignant, cruel and intriguingly ambivalent about who’s controlling whom, it’s a film of enormous subtlety.<br>

**Producer John Houseman on ‘Letter from an Unknown Woman’**<br>
_Letter from an Unknown Woman_ is bittersweet Viennese. It is the confession of a woman who has been in love for most of her life with a man to whom she had meant so little that – though they have been intimate, in different ways, at three different times of their lives – he does not even remember her. The first two-thirds of our story were altogether romantic. They were a joy to work on. Joan Fontaine had proved in _Rebecca_, _Suspicion_ and _Jane Eyre_ that she was an expert at portraying the emotions of an adolescent girl in thrall to an older man. She had no difficulty at all in playing the teenage Lisa, crouched in the dark stairwell, listening to her idol playing Chopin upstairs in his room. And she was charming and moving as the passionate young Viennese girl giving herself without regret in a romantic ecstasy to the man she has worshipped for most of her life.

The third and last episode presented more serious hazards of writing and acting. The frame of Zweig’s novella is a letter written by Lisa as she is dying; it is not a reproach but a profession of gratitude to the man who, without being aware of it, has given her all the love she has ever known. It is a literary device that was valid in print but seemed less convincing when it was transferred to the more specific realism of film. And Joan, with her poignant immaturity, ran into problems of credibility when she was called upon to play a European femme du monde in her thirties.

Koch was a sincere writer with a good sense of structure. Vienna was not his territory, but he had Max by his side to guide him and to devise some of the script’s most imaginative moments. This was an atmosphere that Ophuls knew intimately and dearly loved: he used it in _Liebelei_ and would use it again, years later, in _La Ronde_. All through production he was tireless and insatiable, to the point of exasperation, in his insistence upon authentic atmospheric detail. Above all I remember that touching, entirely original scene of Lisa’s seduction in the mock-up compartment of a European railroad carriage with the painted Alpine scenery moving by outside on a slowly rolling canvas cyclorama propelled by a little man furiously pedalling a stationary bicycle.

Yet, as the film moved into its final stages, I detected a disturbing tone of discouragement and diminishing energy. Some of this had to do with Joan’s performance; some was inherent in the form of Zweig’s novella, to which Koch had scrupulously – perhaps too scrupulously – adhered. Some of it stemmed from Ophuls’ mercurial temperament.

One night, during the last week of shooting, I got a call from him long after midnight. He begged me to drive out and meet him as soon as possible at an all-night joint in the Valley next to the studio. When I got there I found him plunged in raging gloom. We sat for two hours over drinks and coffee, then walked around the back lot, where the dawn was coming up over our Viennese amusement park. Max informed me that he had spent the previous evening running the rough cut of our film and it was his sombre conclusion that our ending was downbeat, maudlin and wholly lacking in dramatic conviction. He blamed Zweig, Koch, Miss Fontaine and, most particularly, himself for our failure. Once in a while he wept, blew his nose and went on talking. There was truth in what he said, all the more since the censors in the Breen Office had taken much of the emotional shock out of Lisa’s last moments with her lover. But at five in the morning, I found his attitude defeatist, self-indulgent and dangerous. I pointed out that it was too late in the day for him to be making these discoveries; that it was impossible, at this stage of the film, to reshape the ending without losing the essential quality of Zweig’s story. I assured him that the film was beautiful; I did all I could to send him back on to the set in a less calamitous frame of mind. Three hours later I watched him riding a boom with his usual enthusiasm and that night he called to tell me that our rushes were wonderful.

In the fall of 1947 my future in the film business looked bright. I seemed to have not one winner, but two. While we were preparing and shooting _Letter from an Unknown Woman_, I had continued to work with Nick [Nicholas Ray] on the final editing and scoring of _Thieves Like Us_. In September we had two good previews, then cut the negative and began showing it to critics of the trades and magazines under its new title of _Your Red Wagon_ (the title of a blues number in the film). Our first reviews were wonderful; Iris Barry gave us a special running at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and word began to get around that we had one of the sleepers of the year.

Then, overnight, disaster struck. Our film was scheduled to be released during the winter of 1947-48. But, before that, the trades carried the dark news one morning that RKO had been acquired by Howard Hughes. His first act was to get rid of Dore Schary and to reverse all arrangements made by the previous management. These included the release of our film, which mouldered in a studio vault for two years before it was released under the title _They Live by Night_. The magazines would not review it a second time or reprint their earlier notices. The daily press treated it as what it had become – a B-picture on the second half of a double bill.

This sabotage of my favourite picture left me with _Letter from an Unknown Woman_ as my last hope of establishing my reputation as a serious filmmaker. The Doziers seemed happy; our San Francisco preview had gone well and I was beginning to get congratulatory letters from people whose opinions I valued – such as Preston Sturges and Joseph Losey.

My euphoria was short-lived. In the latter part of April, _Letter from an Unknown Woman_ was given a hurried national release. It was the year of the Korean War and the national mood was violently anti-romantic. With few exceptions, our reviews were terrible. It took several years of European success to restore _Letter_ to its honoured place in the canon of Max Ophuls’ film work. In its day, it was an unmitigated disaster – critically and commercially – and a devastating defeat for us all.<br>
