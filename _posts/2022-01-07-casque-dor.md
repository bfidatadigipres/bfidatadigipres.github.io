**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Unsurprisingly, Truffaut revered Jacques Becker, a former assistant to Renoir who made films of a similarly fluent lyricism and emotional complexity. This elegant blend of crime movie and love story, set in the Paris of the Impressionists, sees a carpenter (Reggiani) incur the wrath of gangleader Félix (Dauphin) when he courts Marie (Signoret). Truffaut especially adored its casting, its narrative sophistication and its visual beauty.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
_Casque d’or_ is more than ever a proof of Becker’s strictness of control; for this is his first ‘period’ film, and in certain respects an avowed venture into the picturesque. The world that has excited his imagination is that of Paris of  _la belle epoque_, with all its attendant decorative charm. The social level of the story is low, its tone violent. Marie, its heroine, is a beautiful _gigolette_, nicknamed ‘Casque d’or’ from her glorious crown of golden hair which she wears dressed ‘en casque’; she is the mistress of Roland, one of a gang of cut-throats who operate under the orders of Léca – who himself desires Marie.

Becker is reported to have described the effect he has striven for as ‘something between the painter Renoir and Eugène Sue.’ The spirit of Renoir is present chiefly in the portrait of Casque d’or herself, most obviously in her coiffure and dress, but also in her generous and challenging sensuality, her delighted response to the physical joy of love; and it is there as well in the presentation of the happier phases of the story – the slow procession of boats, oars dipping and voices singing, laden with apaches and their ‘filles’, down the river at Joinville; and the pastoral idyll, with its blowing grass and trees, which is Marie’s and Manda’s short experience of life together. It is the other side of the drama, presumably, that Becker wishes to evoke by his mention of Sue: the narrative of plotting and intrigue; Léca’s gang with its code of ‘honour’ and violence; the ruthless fights-to-the-death. But although there are conventional thriller elements here, all this is a far cry from Sue’s _Les Mystères de Paris_. D’Eaubonne’s sets and Robert Le Fèbvre’s straightforward photography eschew the Gothic for a natural, though continuously atmospheric visual style; and this is matched by a decoupage of corresponding sobriety. The story unfolds evenly, in a steady march, of gradual, overpowering effectiveness.

Firstly, it is a love story. Becker’s acute sensibility to what one may call the emotional geography, the varying currents and strange depths which characterise the most intimate human relations, has always been one of his strengths and it lifts _Casque d’or_ from the category of melodrama, or merely another essay in the romantic-pathetic, to tragedy. Marie and Manda are characters vividly and roundly presented; their relationship changes and progresses, and as it progresses our insight into their situation deepens. This is not the director’s achievement alone; he owes a great deal to his actors. The performances of Simone Signoret as Marie and Serge Reggiani as Manda are remarkable above all for their complete fusion, at a level of great intensity, of their own personalities and acting styles into a shared conception. The effect of unity makes it as impossible to imagine the film without these players, as to imagine it directed by anyone but Becker. Signoret’s Marie, in particular, shows a radiant blossoming of talent: a creation entrancingly feminine, with a range of intuition that compasses the arrogant (and irresistible) wilfulness of the earlier sequences as persuasively as the later warmth of a woman passionately and constantly in love. Superbly confident in her power of attraction, it is she who dominates the first half of the film: her reckless provocation of Roland, her summons of Manda, her impertinent encouragement of Léca’s advances. Manda, seduced by a glance, fatally allows himself to be led back to the world of crime which he had resolved to put behind him. Once the two have become lovers, however, the balance shifts, to reveal the basis of truth in a relationship so doubtfully entered into.

Manda has been shown from the first as a secret man, driven in upon himself by harsh experience, inflexibly self-reliant. (Reggiani’s performance, with its banked interior fire and its almost heroic renunciation of display, communicates exactly the strength and the weakness of this fine-tempered pride. This is resolutely interior acting, with the strength in it to afford the sacrifice of certain immediate effects, to achieve moments of subtle and startling revelation). With intimacy, it is Manda’s influence that becomes dominant, his love for Marie still combined with an unswerving pursuit of his self-chosen course of action. Marie loses her stridency (with her _casque_); devotion replaces appetite and the cocotte becomes a wife. When the couple eavesdrop on a bourgeois marriage in the village church, it is she who finds herself affected by the solemn symbolism of the ceremony; Manda, a tender but unsentimental lover, is impatiently indulgent. And when Léca has his friend Raymond arrested for the murder of Roland, the same pride that won Manda his happiness with Marie forces him to sacrifice it. ‘N’y penses plus’, says Marie as she lies beside him in bed, knowing that he is thinking of his friend, ‘Penses à moi.’ ‘Je pense toujours à toi, Marie,’ he replies; but in the morning he has gone. It is the perfect harmony of these scenes between Marie and Manda, very soft and quiet (there are no dwelt-on passages of love-making), and above all their sense of promise as well as fulfilment, that give the end of the film, and their long tearing-apart, its peculiar quality of pain.

Equally, Becker has been able to present the scenes between Marie and Manda with absolute directness and simplicity. Dialogue between them is pared to a minimum; all but the barely essential has been excluded. Marie’s seduction of Manda is told in three long panning shots as she waltzes across the room in front of him, cutting from her glowing self-display to his guarded eyes as they follow her past. When she has pursued him to his lodgings, his acceptance and their mutual desire is established without a word: one charged close-up on each, and an embrace.

Writing of Becker in 1947, on the strength of his first three films alone, the French critic Roger Régent remarked on the singular purity of his style, and on its power to build sequences to an extreme degree of tension. In _Casque d’or_ this style is more strikingly than ever in evidence. The movement of the whole picture shows a highly developed command of tempo, a rhythm which can accommodate the long, sustained look at a scene (the first set-up of all, for instance), as well as the series of swift, detailed glances. The images are of continuous but simple richness – in particular a poetic use of close-up such as is possible only to an artist who has achieved great sureness of his attitude, as of his _metier_.<br>
