**What’s it about?**<br>

Jim Henson’s cult fantasy fairy tale features David Bowie’s menacing Goblin King, who has taken young Sophie’s baby brother and placed him in the centre of a fiendishly challenging maze populated by creatures of all shapes and sizes.

We present a restored digital version of _Labyrinth_ projected in glorious 4K.<br>

**Labyrinth**<br>
Jim Henson (1936-1990) was interested in developing fairytales all his life, but only in the last two decades before his death had the clout to be able to follow this interest through. By devising a range of creatures and narratives which pushed back the boundaries of the possible, he made a major contribution to the creation of fairytales for the screen.

His ﬁrst foray into the genre came on the back of the enormous success of two TV series: _Sesame Street_, and _The Muppet Show_. These made Kermit the Frog an established favourite with American children, so Henson decided to use him as a way of luring young viewers to watch a version of _The Frog Prince_ (1971). Kermit thus came to be the narrator of fairytale which, in Henson’s hands, became a story about friendship and trust, enlivened by comedy and songs.

In the 80s the Muppets transferred to the big screen, and made so much money for the studio that Henson was given the go-ahead to start work on a pet fairytale project of his own, _The Dark Crystal_ (1982). In this he broke away completely from Muppets, seeking to create a comprehensive alternative universe without them. However, despite all the creative energy that had gone into it_, The Dark Crystal_ did badly at the box-ofﬁce. Trying to work out why, Henson decided that puppet creatures are good at being funny or nasty, but do not work as central protagonists, because an audience cannot satisfactorily identify with them.

Four years later, for _Labyrinth_, Henson brought humans (including David Bowie) into his fairytales. On the surface the ﬁlm has a very contemporary tone, as illustrated by the Junk Lady and her shopping trolley, but it nonetheless contains some standard fairytale ingredients. The framework of Sarah’s search harks back to Lewis Carroll’s _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_ and L. Frank Baum’s _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_. The apparently uncaring stepmother and the ballroom sequence both invoke the Cinderella story. The poisoned fruit that Sarah succumbs to reminds viewers of the apple which nearly kills Snow White.

But there is a lot of original Henson as well. Every effort was made to ensure that all the _Labyrinth_ creatures were as lifelike as possible. Their skin was tinted and textured, and had wrinkles, hair and ﬁngerprints where appropriate. A choreographer and acting coach worked with the puppeteers, helping them to achieve convincing movements. The aim behind all this was to make it possible for audiences to accept the creatures as credible living characters.

To a large extent, the ﬁlm was successful, faring much better at the box-ofﬁce than _The Dark Crystal_. Nonetheless, Henson abandoned cinema features, and original stories, after _Labyrinth_. Instead, he went back to TV and created _The Storyteller_, a blend of showing and telling based on Grimm and other traditional sources. <br>
