Even as his rock fame blossomed in the mid-70s, Bowie periodically challenged audiences with his avant-garde film tastes. The 1976 Isolar tour, which introduced the singer’s glacially aloof ‘Thin White Duke’ persona, opened with a screening of the revolutionary silent short _Un chien andalou_ (1929), a collaboration between director Luis Buñuel and artist Salvador Dalí that is full of surreal nightmare imagery, including a notorious eye-slicing shot.

The Isolar tour’s starkly lit monochrome stage design borrowed from another of Bowie’s enduring cinematic obsessions, German expressionism. After first seeing Robert Weine’s classic silent horror film _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ (1920) as an impressionable teenager, Bowie developed a lifelong passion for the expressionist painters and filmmakers that flourished in Germany’s prewar Weimar Republic.

‘He never forgot _Dr. Caligari_,’ critic and author Paul Morley wrote in a 2016 _Guardian_ essay on Bowie’s silent-age roots. ‘The mysterious, menacing Carnival man, the drunkenly askew streets and buildings, the make-up of the sleepwalking fortune teller, the unnerving predictions of death.’ Flashbacks to _Caligari_, Morley wrote, ‘would occur for the rest of his life, represented through the mutant characters he played, the art and entertainment he designed and enacted, the unconventional life he lived. He never escaped their shadows, and the light they threw on the darkness of the mind.’

Historically, _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ can fairly be reckoned as the beginning of German Expressionist cinema. In terms of the gothic – the potent blend of horror and romance with intent to thrill – it represents only a milestone in a vigorous early century revival of a genre which had somewhat faded since the romantic era. Three seminal manifestations of the new gothic were British: Oscar Wilde’s _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1890), Bram Stoker’s _Dracula_ (1897) and W.W. Jacobs’s _The Monkey’s Paw_ (1902), all of which have captivated filmmakers ever since. The ghost stories of M.R. James began to appear in 1904, those of Algernon Blackwood in 1906. Gaston Leroux wrote _Le Mystère de la chambre jaune_ – the first of several adventures of Detective Rouletabille – in 1907 and _The Phantom of the Opera_ in 1911. Most influential for German cinema, however, were the novels and stories of Hanns Heinz Ewers (1871-1943), later to be notorious as the biographer of Horst Wessel, who portrayed himself in the hero of the Frank Braun gothic trilogy (_Der Zauberlehrling_, _Alraune_ and _Vampir_).

Before _Caligari_, German filmmakers had already seized on the new gothic.  The first version of _The Phantom of the Opera_ was directed by the young dancer-choreographer and Reinhardt collaborator Ernst Matray in 1916.  _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ was filmed seven times between 1910 and 1918, in Denmark, Russia, Hungary and America, as well as in Germany, where it was directed by Richard Oswald. _The Student of Prague_, freely adapted by Ewers from Poe’s _William Wilson_, was filmed by Paul Wegener and Stellan Rye in 1913; Ewers’s own _Der unsichtbare Mensch_ (_The Invisible Man_) was filmed in 1916, and the scandalous _Alraune_ – frequently to be adapted in later years – in 1918. Old Jewish myth gave Paul Wegener and Henrik Galeen a gothic  theme for _Der Golem_ (1915). In Britain the first of at least ten adaptations of _The Monkey’s Paw_ appeared in 1915. America seemed slower to feel the new mood, but turned back to an earlier era with two adaptations of _Frankenstein_, in 1910 (Edison) and in 1915 (Joseph W. Sunley’s _Life without Soul_).

The marriage of gothic and Expressionism achieved by _Caligari_ was nevertheless a major step for cinema, even if some critics have echoed Blaise Cendrars’s complaint that it ‘casts discredit on modern Art because the discipline of modern painters (Cubist) is not the hyper sensibility of madmen but equilibrium, intensity and mental geometry.’ It is a criticism that fails to recognise that filmmakers were influenced by Expressionist theatre rather than the pure plastic arts of Expressionism which the theatre had borrowed and processed to suit its own forms and purposes. Karlheinz Martin’s _Von Morgens bis Mitternacht_ (1920) was in fact directly based on the stage production of George Kaiser’s Expressionist play. Robert Wiene made three more films in the Expressionist manner, _Genuine_ (1925) and the more successful _Raskolnikov_ (1923) and _Orlacs Hände_ (1925). Other significant titles that belong to the new gothic-Expressionist school were _Nosferatu_ (1921), Murnau’s unauthorised interpretation of _Dracula_, Fritz Lang’s _Destiny_ (1921), Arthur Robison’s _Warning Shadows_ (1923), Paul Leni’s _Waxworks_ and Henrik Galeen’s _The Student of Prague_ (1926). An intriguing title from the group now lost is _Das Haus des Dr. Gaudeamus_ (1921), co-written by Thea von Harbou, based on her novel _Haus ohne Tür und Fenster_, and directed by the multi-talented Friedrich Feher, who plays Franz in _Caligari_.

Viewed afresh, _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ remains, after nearly a century, a staggeringly effective film. Very few feature-length films of its period are so compellingly watchable. It makes a dazzling merit of its tiny stage and shoestring budget, thanks to its crazy cubist/expressionist decors, and the impudence of the spinning umbrellas which masquerade as a fairground and the descending flight of steps which magically conveys us there from the city. The story is economically told, with its own jagged rhythm and coherent performances. The painted landscapes, the menacing Caligari and the uncanny Cesare – vanishing into his own shadow; agonisingly, mesmerisingly opening the great enchanted eyes – have bequeathed some of the most haunting images of the gothic cinema.
