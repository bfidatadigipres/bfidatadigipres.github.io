**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

‘An important piece of history, which should be kept alive’.<br>
**Michael Divver, BFI Member**

Roland Joffé’s remarkable depiction of the Khmer Rouge in 1970s Cambodia follows the real-life story of a Cambodian journalist and an American journalist who find themselves in serious danger as events in Phnom Penh spiral out of control. Ngor was a real-life survivor of Khmer Rouge prison camps and won an Oscar® for his role as photojournalist Dith Pran. The film also features an outstanding musical score by Mike Oldfield.<br>

The starting point for producer David Puttnam’s film _The Killing Fields_ was quite lowkey: a picture in _Time_ magazine of a passionate embrace that entwined _New York Times_ journalist Sydney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran at a refugee camp on the Thai border, the positive ending to four harrowing years of separation. Filmed three years later by director Roland Joffé and cameraman Chris Menges, the neat resolution offered by that image was to be deflected to pictures of stunned refugees and a textual note to the effect that the country’s agony continues. John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’ plays on the soundtrack: loosely ironic, naggingly inappropriate and somewhat vulgar. ‘The images,’ says Joffé, ‘are the summation of what the film is about – broken families and broken individuals.’

The basic discourses of _The Killing Fields_ concern people and politics rather than journalism. Reporters are shown, in fact, to be wholly impotent. Power failures and transmitter breakdowns dog their efforts to get news out to the world, and what comes back on the radio is often whitewash and misinterpretation. In the second half of the film, Pran, Schanberg’s interpreter and a fellow journalist, watches passively as those who have not learnt the rule that only the silent survive are led off to execution. Meanwhile, back in the United States, Schanberg is stuck with his guilt and frustration at not being able to do anything for his friend. The powerlessness mirrors, on the larger plane, the inability of the American regime to achieve its policy objectives in South East Asia, and the despair of French embassy officials unable to do anything for the Cambodians who have sought refuge behind their walls.

_The Killing Fields_ is sharply distinguished from films about Vietnam made by American directors. It does not share the exclusively American orientation of such films as _The Deer Hunter_ or _Apocalypse Now_, nor does it ever lose the human message in orgies of hardware or distracting allegory. The opening images of _The Killing Fields_ hint at this style of filmmaking: a tranquil landscape is disrupted by helicopters and then napalm. But Schanberg promptly intervenes in voice-over to speak of his relationship with Pran, the constant centre of the film thereafter. ‘Although it is a film about war,’ Joffé said before shooting began, ‘containing a lot of complex issues, it is actually about people. I would hate it if the tanks took over from the eyes or the machine guns from people’s hands and feet.’

‘The idea was not to go in for masses of shocking imagery,’ Joffé says. ‘I wanted it to be a film of consequences. Any time there was a killing, it was specifically used as part of the film’s emotional charge.’ Later, when a military outpost falls to the Khmer Rouge, the camera focuses twice on a screaming girl. This human scale is evident even in more lurid scenes, as when hospital cleaners sweep up the blood around rotting corpses or Pran ambles through damp fields lined with skeletons as he escapes from village death squads.

Joffé not only denies the audience the let out that objective images of bomb devastation would provide, he also refuses to provide a demonology that could salve the liberal conscience. The American embassy officials are sensitive, if somewhat blind, people trying to do their jobs within the limitations laid down from above. The Khmer Rouge murderers in Pran’s community are misguided children. Even the prospective executioners of Schanberg, Pran and their fellow journalists are depicted as innocents, picking over the appurtenances of the reporting trade like savages at their first meeting with western civilisation. And cadre member Phat speaks to Pran with concern, shortly before his own execution, of the extent to which the revolution has lost faith in its people. ‘We cared little,’ said the real Schanberg, ‘about local or international politics or about military strategy. What propelled both of us was the human impact.’ Whereas in _Under Fire_ and _The Year of Living Dangerously_ the political leaders Somoza and Suharto enter the story, the superpowers responsible for the human tragedy of _The Killing Fields_ are only indicated in glancing asides – a radio broadcast about Sihanouk in Peking, a smashed picture of Brezhnev, the lowering of the Stars and Stripes, a video of Nixon’s attempt to justify dropping several billion dollars worth of bombs on Cambodia.

Like _Under Fire_ and _The Year of Living Dangerously_, _The Killing Fields_ was made by a non-American director with finance raised largely outside Hollywood (it would not, however, have been made without the commitment of a British company, Goldcrest Films). _The Killing Fields_ is unique in the way it combines a foreground story of two individuals with the wider political landscape, but it shares the problems inherent in making an American film on the evils of the American way of international politics. The concessions that had to be made to sensitivities at Warner Brothers could have disembowelled the film of meaning. Instead, by treating the pressures to take the film away from its agitprop beginnings as problems requiring solution, its makers have deepened the political and historical analysis. The studio pressure to produce a picture that would be acceptable to American audiences functioned as only one element in a dialectical process that also involved documented reality and the different perspectives offered by screenwriter, producer and director. The result is a film that diverts the audience from any facile analysis and only proposes conclusions without limiting interpretation. ‘The film was not there,’ Joffé says, ‘to hector people, neither was it meant to wrap everything up in a neat package of anger and discontent. What I wanted to do was to bring people close to the emotional colour of the events, from which they are free to draw off ideas.’

Puttnam has spoken of _The Killing Fields_ as a new film genre: unpackaged political Hollywood. The claim may be exaggerated, but the film’s accomplishment does provide some vindication for the Goldcrest-style way of making British films. It shows that there is scope, given backing from a well-financed British company and a canny producer with a sophisticated approach to American sensitivities, to use the resources of Hollywood for work that is authentic and carries messages that go against the grain of mainstream American filmmaking. ‘The company has to remain distinctive,’ says Goldcrest’s James Lee. ‘The only way that we are going to get any distribution support in America is if our films are sufficiently different.’<br>
