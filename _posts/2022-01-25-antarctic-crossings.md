_Introduced by BFI curator Patrick Russell_

The resumption of Antarctic exploration in the 1950s was captured in dazzling colour by some of Britain’s finest documentary filmmakers. Don’t miss a rare Technicolor print of _The White Continent_ (1951), about the Norwegian-British-Swedish Expedition to Queen Maud Land, shot by Thomas Stobart of _Conquest of Everest_ fame. Plus Derek Williams’ Oscar®-nominated accounts of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition: _Foothold on Antarctica_ (1956) and _Antarctic Crossing_ (1958).

**The White Continent**  
An account of the co-operative Norwegian-British-Swedish Expedition to Queen Maud Land during 1949-1952, the first truly international Antarctic expedition, with the nations each sending men and sharing the cost. The film covers only the first part of the expedition, its departure from Europe in the Norwegian sealer _Norsel_, its encounter with heavy weather in the ‘Roaring Forties’, the transfer of cargo from the whaling factory ship _Thorshovdi_ to the _Norsel_ in difficult conditions, near the South Sandwich Islands, the _Norsel_’s voyage through iceberg-laden sea and then pack ice until it reaches its final destination. The wintering party is landed and the setting up of the base camp is shown, and the film ends with the departure of the _Norsel_.

This is a good, direct, continuously absorbing account of an expedition which is still in progress. The subject has been made familiar by other films, but in this case is given interest by excellent colour photography. Though it gives very few personal impressions of the men on the expedition, it is an admirable general record.

**Foothold on Antarctica**  
The first stage in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition was the establishment of a base camp on the fringe of the Weddell Sea. This film, sponsored by British Petroleum as part of their contribution to the Expedition, provides an interesting record of the progress and daily routine of the journey of the _Theron_ and her crew to Shackleton Base, which was established in January 1956. A modest, factual approach, excellent photography and an apt musical score give the film a simple eloquence that a more dramatic treatment might have lost. The Expedition’s leaders, Dr Vivian Fuchs and Sir Edmund Hillary, are seen at work and also helped with the shooting as did many other members of the crew. Despite difficult working conditions, the colour is generally effective and there are some exciting shots of the formation of ice on the surface of the Weddell Sea. The film ends with a list of those who remained behind at the base, thus creating a feeling of anticipation for an adventure which is only just beginning.

**Antarctic Crossing**  
This unique record of the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1955-1958 was made under appalling difficulties, and sometimes at temperatures well below zero. Skilful editing has resulted in a remarkable picture with moments of humour and despair linked by scenes of grandeur and beauty. The purpose of the expedition was to cross the Antarctic Continent from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea via the South Pole, and to carry out a complete programme of scientific research on the way. _Foothold on Antarctica_ took the story from the departure of the advance party from London to their arrival at Shackleton Base in January 1956. _Antarctic Crossing_ continues the story with the main party’s crossing under Sir Vivian Fuchs and the Ross Sea party’s exploration, under Sir Edmund Hillary, of the last continent uncharted by man. This modest and factual film also contains some dramatic sequences from the original films of the Scott and Shackleton expeditions, which provide startling contrast to the often impressive colour photography of the modern parties.
