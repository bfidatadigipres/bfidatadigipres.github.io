The first of Almodóvar's 13 features to be shown in competition at Cannes,  _All about My Mother_ not only won him the prize for best director but also proved to be the popular hit of the festival, with the often cynical Cannes audience granting it a lengthy standing ovation. Clocking up over a million admissions in France alone, _All about My Mother_ held its own against such mainstream rivals as the Connery/Zeta-Jones _Entrapment_ all over Europe, thus fulfilling its director’s prediction to the Italian press that the big budgets of Hollywood could only be beaten by something that comes free to Europeans: imagination.

_All about My Mother_ is the final part of what can now be recognised as the loose trilogy of Almodóvar’s mature ‘blue period’ (as opposed to the earlier, more florid ‘rose’ films). Like the first of the threesome _The Flower of My Secret_ (1995), it focuses on one woman’s grief, in this case Manuela’s at the loss of a beloved son; but like the second, _Live Flesh_, it boasts a complex plot and a gallery of characters whose lives intersect with clockwork precision and to deadly effect. If _All about My Mother_ is, then, and ‘Almodrama’ (as Cuban critic Cabrera Infante calls the new genre), it is one of unusually wide interest: as attractive to film theorists as to _fashionistas_ and as remarkable for its masterful cinematic technique as for its new commitment to social critique. And as in the earlier films of the trilogy, cinematographer Affonso Beato (a veteran of the Brazilian _cinema nuovo_ movement) and composer Alberto Iglesias (a long-time collaborator with Julio Medem) help to set a tone at once gravely austere and powerfully sensual.

The opening credits shimmer and dissolve as the camera pans slowly over medical paraphernalia: drips and dials in blue, red and yellow. In a typical combination of economy and stylishness, this colour coding will continue throughout the film. Manuela shelters beneath a primary-hued umbrella on the dark, rainy Madrid night when her son Esteban (Eloy Azorin) is run over seeking an autograph from drama diva Huma Rojo (veteran Marisa Paredes) after a stage performance of _A Streetcar Named Desire_. And the second theatrical section of the film is yet more stylised: escaping to the Barcelona she left when pregnant 18 years earlier, Manuela encounters in swift succession the trans prostitute La Agrado (newcomer Antonia San Juan), pregnant nun Sister Rosa (played by Spain’s favourite young actress, Penélope Cruz) and Huma herself, whose production has transferred to the Catalan capital.

The marginal milieu, if not the glamorous production values, is almost parodically reminiscent of Almodóvar’s ‘rose’ manner. And _All about My Mother_ is densely self-referential. Cecilia Roth, who has worked in her native Argentina for the last decade, has not starred in an Almodóvar feature since _Labyrinth of Passion_ (1982); memories of her as nymphomaniac Sexilia sit oddly with her brave performance here, at once fiercely emotional and unsentimental. Her character Manuela is a nurse who participates in training seminars on counselling relatives of prospective organ donors. This is a sequence repeated near verbatim from _The Flower of My Secret_, but now with the twist that the simulation of death will be repeated for real. Almodóvar completists will love other tiny gestures to fans: La Agrado’s Chanel suit matches Victoria Abril’s in _High Heels_ (1991); her defiant claim ‘I’m authentic’ echoes Rossy de Palma’s lesbian maid in _Kika_ (1993). The dubbed inserts of Bette Davis in _All about Eve_ recall the Joan Crawford clips from _Johnny Guitar_ in _Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown_ (1988), while the scenes of _A Streetcar Named Desire_, shot with an eye for the ironies of on- and off-stage life, parallel those of Cocteau’s _La Voix humaine_ in _The Law of Desire_ (1987). Self-citation is used as narrative shorthand, increasing the density and intensity of the new work by calling up the rich universe Almodóvar had created over 20 years.

But the condensation and displacement of Almodóvar’s earlier oeuvre are matched by a newly analytic use of cinematic resources. The plot may be melodramatic and the ambience theatrical, but Almodóvar has coached his actresses to produce what Spanish critics have called a ‘Swedish’ performance style in which less is more. Prone to tears, in accordance with the director’s belief that ‘women weep better’, _All about My Mother_’s circle of females also confront death, disease and abandonment with a stoic mask of grief all the more moving for its impassivity.  And there are some pitiless close-ups of San Juan and Paredes, revealing the traces of time on ravaged faces, however theatrically preserved. Yet there is still space in this hybrid ‘screwball drama’, as Almodóvar styles it, for nicely judged moments of comedy, as when Sister Rosa claims that ‘Prada is perfect for nuns’.

This extended range of performance style is matched by Almodóvar’s shift of location. Hitherto confined to the old imperial capital of Madrid, his films have ignored the decentralisation of the Spanish state that has been the great achievement of democracy during the period in which the director has worked, a constitutional experiment the UK has only just embarked upon. And Barcelona, the maritime metropolis, has never looked more beautiful than through the lens of the unrepentant son of arid la Mancha. Introduced with a swooning helicopter shot from the Tibidabo hill down to the night lights of the bay, Spain’s second city lives up to Almodóvar’s claim that it is the ‘greatest of film sets’. The distinctive towers of Sagrada Familia (relit specially for the film) swim and buckle as reflected in Manuela’s taxi window. La Agrado’s home beat is the grimy but multi-racial Raval (formerly known as the Barrio Chino), while Sister Rosa’s intolerant mother resides in a glamorous apartment decorated in ornate Catalan art nouveau.

But location and dislocation go hand in hand. The visually striking scene in which cars slowly cruise prostitutes as if in some lower circle of suburban hell is shot not in Barcelona but in Madrid. The soundtrack features the swelling chords of the Argentine _bandoneón_, appropriate for the central character Manuela but highly incongruous in this Catalan context. And the bilingual status of Barcelona is barely acknowledged, with the actors essaying only the barest of greetings in the local language. Indifferent to local politics, still Almodóvar writes a visual love letter to the Catalan capital – one welcomed by the Catalan press, which has often been friendlier to the director than that of his home town.

As mobile as Manuela, shuttling between Barcelona and Madrid, Almodóvar is also as consistent as her, in his focus on love and loss. And this alternation of motion and stasis is played out in his shooting and cutting styles. The director has remarked how reluctant he now is to move the camera without good cause.  So such key moments as Esteban’s accident are shot with studied simplicity: the camera merely cants sideways to the ground as from the dying son’s point of view we see a sodden Manuela come howling into shot.

Three subtle features, however, contribute substantially to the film’s narrative and aesthetic effect. The first is the slow pans along walls, floors and curtains that introduce many sequences. Like Ozu’s interpolated shots of flowers or chimneys, unmotivated by plot, Almodóvar’s pans suggest that his characters are caught up in a web of accidents that constitutes everyday life and cannot be extricated from the highly coloured locations they inhabit. The second technique is the dissolve. The grid of Esteban’s notebook fades into the flashing lights of the theatre where Huma was performing, a reference to the unwitting cause of the youth’s death at once tragic and ironic. Or Almodóvar cuts from the black mouth of a waste bin to the ever-receding railway tunnel through which Manuela flees the city. Narrative pace is quickened by bold, elliptical editing: located as we are within Manuela’s mind, we see only those essential elements that drive forward her drama of primal loss and ultimate redemption.

The final technique is the two shot. Consistently exploiting the wide screen and scorning television-friendly square composition, Almodóvar’s framings privilege the relation between characters. In the prologue mother and son are kept constantly together on screen, whether watching Bette Davis on television or Huma Rojo on stage. Later the central figure of Manuela will generously share the frame with the supporting players: Huma, Rosa, La Agrado, and Niña (Candela Peña), Huma’s junkie lover. Superficially similar to _Live Flesh_, which also focused on the relationships between several characters and boasted sharp shooting and cutting, _All about My Mother_ is significantly different from its predecessor. For in _All about My Mother_ the bond between the characters is not sex, but solidarity.
