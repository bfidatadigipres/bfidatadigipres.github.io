**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**<br>
Oddly enough, after Moreau’s obsessive hunt in _La Mariée était en noir_, and before the more jocular manipulations of destiny and chance by the femme semi-fatale of _Une belle fille comme moi_, Truffaut has declared himself dissatisfied with _La Sirène du Mississipi_ because of the disproportionate weight that it supposedly throws on Catherine Deneuve’s insouciant gold-digger. Odd, that is, since the film seems an ideal mapping out of everything that is quintessentially Truffaut, and the relationship of Louis and Julie/Marion such a perfect and characteristically balanced match – the idealism of the one, the deceits and disguises of the other – that the synthesis suggested by the name of the island where they meet, and anticipated through the introductory clip from _La Marseillaise_ depicting the revolutionary alliance of the National Guard with the volunteers from Marseilles, almost fails to take place (and appears to have less chance of doing so in the version that has finally arrived in this country, which is not only lamentably dubbed but shorn of the occasional scene, including one in which the rapprochement of the star-crossed lovers seems for a while most complete).

But the inequality sensed by the director perhaps has less to do with the attention paid to Marion’s capriciousness than with the peculiar passivity with which Louis’ idealism is revealed: a stripping away, in fact of the character’s realism. ‘I don’t keep souvenirs, it’s the ring that matters’ is Louis’ comment when presented with the piece of string sent by Julie Roussel for measuring the wedding ring; Louis commits a calculated deception of his own in writing to Julie that he is the foreman rather than the owner of the cigarette plant, so that money would not be a factor in their long-distance relationship; and Jardine manager of the plant and Louis’ confidential adviser (played by Marcel Berbert, also the film’s producer), is a man who delights in facts and figures.

Louis progresses to his final declaration (and acceptance of his own death) through a series of decreasingly real landscapes: from the lush mountains and valleys of Réunion to some kind of countryside mural (a suggestion of Renoir _père_) in the Cap d’Antibes hotel room where the first reconciliation takes place, to the bleak hotel room in Lyon and the final snowbound hideaway in Switzerland.

But while the terrain becomes progressively more abstract, drained of life and sustenance (while scarcely making a political point, Truffaut lingers equivocally for a moment on the blacks toiling in the fields of Réunion after Louis has passed by on a tour of inspection with his bride), the lovers become more real, or at least more revealed. White is the dominant colour on Réunion, both in the clothes of the central characters and the appointments of the house – a pretence of purity surrounded by darkness, in church and in the bedroom scenes, and in the formal masking device used when Marion slips away to meet her accomplice. When Louis discovers her duplicity, he rips up her immaculate finery and hurls it on the fire; after their first reconciliation, their brief period of contented domesticity in Aix-en-Provence centres on the scene in which, now dressed in indeterminate beige, they sit blissfully in front of the fire; and for their final ‘misunderstanding’, breakdown and equivocal reunion in the mountain cabin, clothing is appropriately sombre and motives and desires have a caricatured clarity (Louis ‘reading’ Marion’s latest treachery in the Snow White comic strip; Marion incongruously clinging to her expensive coat).

Louis’ pursuit of the real Marion and the ideal ‘Julie’ he had originally taken her to be: ‘You were nicer to me when you called me Julie’, complains Marion at one point in their flight – involves his divesting himself of everything he has; a total commitment which Marion maliciously suggests, in her quoting of her ex-accomplice’s division of the world into fools and bastards, is also an abasement which might finally make him unworthy. Paralleling Louis’ private detective hunt (‘I thought I had already come part of the way’, he says ruefully at the beginning, looking from his photograph of Julie Roussel to the girl who presents herself to him, ‘but I find it isn’t so’), ironically conducted through the media of classified advertisements and the television commercial which leads him to Marion in France, is the formal search of the detective Comolli-Michel Bouquet in the Martin Balsam role of the private eye who inconveniently proves as persistent as the hero.

_La Sirène_, in fact, takes the Hitchcock glazing more successfully than any other Truffaut film, and far from being the mistake that its director seems to believe, looks to be, thematically as well as chronologically, the centre-piece in his clutch of films about the wilfully destructive heroine and the wilfully destructible hero.<br>
