At the opening of Gus Van Sant’s _My Own Private Idaho_, we look down a very long stretch of two-lane highway, bisecting the desert scrubland, curving upwards as it disappears into the distant mountain haze. Like a shot, River Phoenix skids into view. His cheek, with its ragged blonde sideburns and faint tracing of acne, is disorientingly close. It’s like waking up with a stranger’s head shoved against your own. Phoenix coughs; you can feel his breath in your ear. Phoenix plays Mike, a narcoleptic gay hustler whose parentage is as incestuous as that of Faye Dunaway’s sister/daughter’s in _Chinatown_ (1974). But since Mike’s origins are below the poverty line, this is no Greek tragedy, just an extra Oedipal wrinkle in an already disenfranchised existence.

_My Own Private Idaho_ shifts fluidly between close-up and panorama, intimacy and distance, symbiosis and alienation. While there is something of Godard in Van Sant’s depiction of sex as labour and/or theatrics, his films are associative rather than didactic, closer to Pasolini’s in their blend of neo-realism and poetic lyricism. The influence of the European art cinema notwithstanding, Van Sant is a distinctly American filmmaker with an extraordinary sense of place. Like the David Lynch of _Eraserhead_ and _Blue Velvet_, Van Sant uses elements of Hollywood psychodrama and American avant-garde trance film to explore the subjectivity of young men coming of age.

Mike and Scott (Keanu Reeves) are part of a gang of street prostitutes who hang out in a derelict hotel. Their leader is Bob Pigeon (William Richert), a fat, beer-guzzling chicken hawk who’s got a thing for the narcissistic Scott. Bob and Scott act out their relationship as Shakespeare’s Falstaff and Prince Hal, challenging each other to ever greater heights of bowlderised verse. Scott has also fallen into the habit of taking care of vulnerable Mike, whose narcolepsy endangers not only his income, but his life.

Threaded with home movie images (no filmmaker has ever been better than Van Sant at forging and integrating these), _My Own Private Idaho_ is a crazy quilt of family romances. Everybody is either looking for or escaping from their families, organising new families, or pouring over photographs of other people’s families. Mike’s sadistic brother/father has a mail-order portrait business in which people send him their family snapshots to be copied. ‘I like to have them around. They keep me company’, he laughs, waving his bottle at the grotesque array. And in the campfire scene, Mike prefaces his lovelorn confession with the agonised question: ‘Do you think I’d be different if I’d had a normal Dad?’ ‘What’s a normal Dad?,’ shrugs Scott, the sophisticate.

Deeply regressive, Mike’s desire for family is for the safety of the mother’s body; his narcolepsy is his defence against the agony of his childhood abandonment. Anything that reminds him of his lost mother triggers a violent psychosomatic reaction. He shakes so much he looks as though he might explode, and then keels over in a stupor. Because he short-circuits before he can connect past and present, he remains as asocial as an infant, and in that sense, innocent. _Idaho_’s fragmented editing style – its heterogeneous visual associations and dense layering of spoken word, concrete sound and music – evokes Mike’s confusion of inside and outside, past and present.

**Gus Van Sant on ‘My Own Private Idaho’**

_Do you like_ My Own Private Idaho _? Do you go back to see your movies?_

I love this movie, It’s my favourite. I’ve seen it probably ten times and it’s much better if you see it more than once. There are all sorts of things that become apparent on multiple viewings – I still see stuff that I didn’t know was there: serendipitous things that are there for a purpose, that are put in, ultimately, by my subconscious. Because when we’re making the film, we’re not doing it intellectually, or at least, I’m not.

The other day I got a fax from Simon Turner, who does Derek Jarman’s soundtracks. It was in a kind of child’s handwriting – I guess that’s how he writes. He had written ‘My’ and then ‘OPI’ and then the next sentence started with a ‘C’, which is like ‘myopic’: That’s exactly how the character of Mike is seeing things – myopically, and I had never noticed. I had some rub-on letters from when I was a kid and I had made a cover for the script with different-sized letters. It came out _My Own Private Idaho_: and I started thinking that the character’s id was part of his insatiable need to be loved, the beast within him that he doesn’t really know about, but that drives him.

A certain contingent of street hustlers I met, boys of his age, were looking for guidance and attention from men. Sex was something they did, but it was unimportant. What was really important was sometimes control and sometimes attention and focus from somebody who could be like their dad. That sort of thing, I guess, would come from the id.

_I read in an interview with you that the campfire scene was rewritten by the actor, River Phoenix._

The character wasn’t originally like that: originally, he was more asexual.  I mean, sex was something he traded in, so he had no real sexual identity. But because he’s bored and they’re in the desert, he makes a pass at his friend. And it just sort of goes by, but his friend also notices that he needs something, so he says we can be friends and he hugs him. But River makes it more like he’s attracted to his friend, he’s in love with him. He made the whole character that way, whereas I wrote the character as more out of it, more myopic.

_Now, it’s all about unrequited love._

It’s about abandonment, yes.

_What about the Shakespeare? What do you think it does to the film?_

I had three different screenplays and segments of each were mixed and cut together. There was one whole screenplay that was just a modernised version of _Henry IV_. I thought it was interesting that Shakespeare was writing about similar characters to the ones I was writing about – I realised that while I was watching Orson Welles’ _Chimes at Midnight_. Then I also had a short story I had written about Ray and his cousin Little George. Ray was a hustler but Little George was just on the street. The story was told through Little George’s eyes; he had narcolepsy. They went to Mexico and Ray fell in love with a girl and had to ditch Little George. And then there was a third script about Mike and Scott, but with less of Scott – he was Mike’s friend but he wasn’t a rich kid and I don’t think they went on a trip and there wasn’t any Shakespeare. So the three scripts were put together and I thought we’d cast street kids and see if they could connect with the Shakespearean words and make any sense of them. So the final version still had one foot in Shakespeare, but now I’m casting Keanu Reeves. So I thought of it as characters who are speaking in their own secret language when they’re together – it’s their way of having fun.
