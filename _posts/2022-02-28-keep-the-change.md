David and Sarah meet at a support group for autistic adults and begin a journey of discovery, getting to know themselves and each other. This award-winning comedy, based on real-life experiences (including those of lead actor Brandon Polansky) is fresh, warm and empathetic.

Presented in partnership with the Film Department, Queen Mary University of London, in collaboration with the Autism through Cinema Neurocultures Collective, supported by Wellcome Trust. 

The screening will be introduced and there will be a facilitated discussion afterwards.

This event will be led by Steven Eastwood, filmmaker and Professor of Film Practice at Queen Mary University of London, and artist Sam Ahern, a member of the Neurocultures Collective.
