_+ pre-recorded Q&A with director JR_

In _Paper & Glue_, JR turns the camera on his own work as he builds some of his most monumental projects.

From early illicit graffiti videos captured on Paris rooftops at night, to the US-Mexico border, to the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, to a current collaboration at a California supermax prison, the film follows JR as he turns these communities inside out, turning images of residents into eye-catching and immersive art installations. _Paper & Glue_ follows the Oscar-nominated _Faces Places_, which was directed by JR along with Agnès Varda.<br>

**JR on ‘Paper & Glue’**<br>
_Paper & Glue_ is a film that challenges viewers’ perceptions by lifting the voices of people and places that are often overlooked. The film is the culmination of years of my work and includes an archive of photography and videos that span back to my adolescence. At the time of many of these recordings, I had no intention or awareness they could be used in this way.

To have my work come full circle exemplifies the power of film, and the power of _Paper & Glue_. I hope this film further uplifts the essentiality of art and the potential it holds to reshape even our most ingrained beliefs. By challenging our expectations of people and places, I hope to change our greater perceptions of the world.

**Keiko Deguchi (Editor) on ‘Paper & Glue’**<br>
I have always been fascinated by the artistic process, so working on this film was pure joy for me. JR has amassed a vast archive of his work over the past twenty years, and what I especially enjoyed about watching the archive was seeing how his art affected his subjects, particularly marginalised people, and witnessing their pride and joy. It was infectious as I screened the raw material.

My hope was to create a film that condenses those feelings and weaves them into a coherent feature-length film. Due to Covid-19, we couldn’t do as much new shooting as we initially planned, so we relied heavily on the archive. Fortunately, the archive had many precious moments, such as when Rosiete from the favela in Brazil sees herself on the wall of a prestigious museum in Rio, or when the inmate in Tehachapi realises that the important part of art is the process.

JR is also a great storyteller, so we relied on his voice to create a sense of intimacy as if he is talking directly to you. His art is spectacular without any of the backstories, and I wanted to make sure that the film does justice to his artwork as well. Building the reveal of the final pasting was just as important to me. I hope we were able to create a film that encapsulated JR’s inspirational art and the richness of the stories and emotions behind them.<br>
