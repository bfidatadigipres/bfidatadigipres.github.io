**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

By the mid-1920s, films of the calibre of _Vanina_ and _Erdgeist_ were becoming scarce. Many studios had fallen into the hands of greedy distributors, and American interests had invaded the German industry, reducing some domestic producers to grinding out ‘quota films’ necessary for American imports. As Asta Nielsen described the situation:

‘The films I was forced to act in for a while were not only pure film-hawking, but were ground out in the studios at breakneck speed for reasons of economy. Often the photographer was not allowed to adjust his lighting and long shots and close-ups whirled among each other in the same constant light. The same decoration served widely different interiors, only from another angle of view. The result ... was technically at the 1908 level.’

It was fortunate, therefore, that G. W. Pabst, wanting to add some ‘names’ to his production of _The Joyless Street_ (1925) after deciding on an unknown (Garbo) for one of the leads, turned to Asta Nielsen and Werner Krauss.

Nielsen’s role is a development of her Magda in _The Abyss_. She plays Maria Lechner, a girl caught up in the poverty of postwar Vienna who sells herself to a rich speculator so that her boyfriend can make a profit on the stock exchange. She discovers him being unfaithful, however, strangles her rival, and resigns herself to being the speculator’s kept woman, letting the police think her boyfriend committed the murder. But a spark of conscience returns and she confesses the crime. Running parallel with the Maria plot is that of Greta Rumfort (Garbo), who flirts with the twilight world of Mrs Greifer’s nightclub but never succumbs, thanks to the somewhat _deus ex machina_ appearance of an American Red Cross lieutenant.

The real poignancy of the film comes from Maria, who although she does sell out to the parasites of society, shows herself to be the only really moral character by choosing to accept the consequences of her actions. Whereas the moral nadir of _The Abyss_ occurred with the rope-dance, in _The Joyless Street_ it comes in a brilliant scene in which the speculator enters a shady hotel room accompanied by a frizzy-haired woman in a see-through, sequined dress. The woman turns towards the camera and is seen to be Maria, a vacant, lifeless expression on her gaudily painted face.

Because of its mutilation by censors in various countries, _The Joyless Street_ did little to enhance Nielsen’s career. Her role was apparently completely excised in the American version, and the programme notes of the London Film Society (its only British screening until 1935) bear witness to its butchering: ‘The action is so complex and tangled that there is little opportunity for detailed characterisation.’ After an almost two-year absence from the screen, during which she toured in a play, she returned to do the last of the ‘street’ films, _Dirnentragodie_ (_Tragedy of the Street_, 1927), for Bruno Rahn.
