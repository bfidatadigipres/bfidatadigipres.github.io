_+ Q&A with creator, writer and executive producer Sally Wainwright and stars Suranne Jones and Sophie Rundle. Hosted by Miranda_ _Sawyer._

Yorkshire, 1834. All eyes are on Anne Lister (Suranne Jones) and Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle) as they set up home together at Shibden Hall as wife and wife, determined to combine their estates and become a power couple. Anne Lister’s entrepreneurial spirit frightens the locals as much as her unconventional love life and, with Halifax on the brink of revolution, her refusal to keep a low profile becomes provocative and dangerous.

Series two will again use the real life diaries of Anne Lister – part of which were written in code – as its source, with every part of Lister’s story based in historical fact and the five million words she wrote in her journals.

Returning to Shibden Hall for the new series are Gemma Whelan as Marian Lister, Gemma Jones as Aunt Anne Lister, and Timothy West as Jeremy Lister. They are joined by many returning cast including Lydia Leonard (Mariana Lawton), Jodhi May (Lady Vere Cameron), Katherine Kelly (Elizabeth Sutherland), Derek Riddell (Captain George Sutherland), Stephanie Cole (Aunt Ann Walker), Peter Davison (William Priestley), Amelia Bullmore (Eliza Priestley), Vincent Franklin (Christopher Rawson), Shaun Dooley (Jeremiah Rawson), Rosie Cavaliero (Elizabeth Cordingley), Joe Armstrong (Samuel Washington), Anthony Flanagan (Ben Sowden) and George Costigan (James Holt).

Joanna Scanlan joins as guest cast for series two in the role of Anne Lister’s outrageous former lover Isabella ‘Tib’ Norcliffe.

_Gentleman Jack_ series one was a hit for BBC One and iPlayer, averaging 6.8 million viewers across its eight-episode run. It won the RTS Drama Series award and received BAFTA nominations in the Drama Series category, as well as the Leading Actress category for Suranne Jones’ performance. Internationally the series won the BANFF Rockie Award for Drama Series: English Language.

_Gentleman Jack_ returns to BBC One and BBC iPlayer this Spring. Series one is available to stream in full on BBC iPlayer.
