_Spirited Away_, a Japanese animated fantasy about a little girl’s adventures in a realm of gods and monsters, invites comparisons to the Alice books,  _The Wizard of Oz_ and even _Harry Potter_. First and foremost, though, this remarkable film is embedded in the personal universe of its auteur-director Hayao Miyazaki, whose standing in Japan is comparable to Steven Spielberg’s or, indeed, J.K. Rowling’s in the west. From its opening in 2001, _Spirited Away_ has become the biggest Japanese release in history. It is also the most successful ‘foreign’ film ever made, with the bulk of its revenue earned in its native country. The film shared the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin festival, followed by an Oscar for best animated feature. It is released in Britain both dubbed and subtitled, the dub produced by Disney and directed by Kirk Wise, who co-directed _Beauty and the Beast_ and _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_.

It’s the baggage _Spirited Away_ carries as a Miyazaki film that may bewilder British audiences. The director’s previous film, the medieval fantasy _Princess Mononoke_ (1997), is available on UK video, but to steal a phrase often applied to Woody Allen, both it and _Spirited Away_ depart from Miyazaki’s early, funny pictures. Not that _Spirited Away_ is humourless – it has some splendid gags – but it’s deeply recursive, uniting themes and images from across the director’s past work. To take the most obvious example, the soot-sprites that toil in the boiler room of the spider-man Kamaji here appear in a different role in Miyazaki’s _My Neighbour Totoro_ (1988), while many other elements form part of what might be called Miyazaki-land: his fascination with flight, ecology, elaborate buildings, strong girls, weary gods, overbuilt machinery, empowering labour, even the pigs heroine Chihiro’s gluttonous parents turn into. _Spirited Away_ is not a sequel or spin-off, yet it’s part of a one-man brand some western critics gloss as that exoticising standby, inscrutable orientalism.

Then again, the film’s opening demonstrates the cross-cultural universality of fairy tales. A family wanders, or is lured, into a magic place where the parents eat tempting food and turn into pigs. Miyazaki cites Japanese folk tales as his influence here, but one could equally invoke _Hansel and Gretel_ or Circe in Homer’s _Odyssey_ (a work referenced by Miyazaki in the past). The first minutes slide from normality to unease to menace as Chihiro’s unwitting parents poke round what they think is a theme-park recreation of old Japan. The crescendo climaxes as the sun sets, the lanterns glow, and Chihiro finds her parents grotesquely transformed. She’s not just scared, she’s revolted, grossed-out; her body wriggles with nausea before she breaks and runs. The scene evokes the darker moments of classic Disney but with more edge than Walt’s balletically styled terrors. Then with barely a pause the mood switches as the heroic boy Haku takes charge, pulling the hapless girl on a dizzy dash to a bathhouse patronised by gods and spirits (where most of the film is set). The delicacy of the score by Joe Hisaishi (a regular musician for director Takeshi Kitano) gives way to bolder strokes _à la_ John Williams, announcing a transition to high adventure.

From here on the audience is at Chihiro’s eye-level, to sink or swim in a fantasy world somewhere between Wonderland and Harry Potter’s Hogwarts, less soap-bubble surreal than the first, more quirkily digressive than the second. Here a spider-man works beside walking frogs and soot-balls with eyes, but there are also boilers, elevators, even an amphibious train. The bathhouse is furnished in lavish mosaic detail, from the painted partitions to the patterns on the cushions. No doubt this reflects the director’s expressed desire to do justice to Japan’s design heritage – the bathhouse blends architecture from various periods – but then Miyazaki has always been a craftsman of imagined space, creating eminently explorable, ‘solid’ drawn worlds that owe little to _Spirited Away_’s fairly sparse CG effects. Miyazaki’s world-building has been compared to that of some video-game adventures, which also depend on first-person exploration, but analogies are legion, from the baroque-gothic labyrinths of Mervyn Peake’s _Gormenghast_ to the play-worlds of Rupert the Bear.

Initially Chihiro stumbles through her world, hurtling down steep stairs and being magically yanked across hallways. Her switch to active protagonist is signalled in the second half, when she hitches up her worker’s uniform, runs along a treacherous metal pipe that nearly drops her to her doom, then climbs the bathhouse to the top. What causes this change? Miyazaki’s answer is hard work, but of a different order from the jovial capitalism of Disney’s dwarves. One of the director’s most popular earlier films, _Kiki’s Delivery Service_ (1989), was about a teen witch making flying deliveries while coping with adolescence. _Spirited Away_ has a similarly offbeat work regime with Chihiro tending Japanese gods and learning responsibility and purpose. This has less to do with stereotypes of the industrious Japanese than with Miyazaki’s own leftist leanings and belief in empowerment through labour. What makes it more than dreary moralism are the witty riffs on the theme. Chihiro’s first trial is to help a soot-sprite carry unnaturally heavy lumps of coal; she succeeds, only for all its co-workers to drop their burdens before her _en masse_.

Western audiences may chafe at the sub-Disney frame rate (much of the animation is done on ‘threes’, or eight distinct frames a second) and the cartoon acting can’t match that of the best US studios. That said, Chihiro’s fearful, clinging behaviour is well observed, while her character design – with a thin gawky body and pipe-cleaner legs – is inspired. In any case, cartoon acting was never the sine qua non of Miyazaki’s films, which are built instead on heightened situations and sublime fantasy landscapes. Even if CG cartoons come to dominate Japan as they do much of the world, there’s a corner of the animation field that will be forever Miyazaki.<br>
