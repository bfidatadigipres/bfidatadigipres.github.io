Satsuki and Mei move to a new home in the country after their mother falls ill, and soon discover house spirits inside and wood spirits and other creatures outside. The girls are whisked away on a magical adventure where they board a ‘cat bus’ and make quirky new friends. Cited by Akira Kurosawa as one of his favourite Japanese films of all time, _My Neighbour Totoro_ introduced the world to the iconic and loveable Totoro, now the logo of Studio Ghibli.<br>

_My Neighbour Totoro_ is my favourite film. I would not change, add or remove a single frame. It is perfect as it stands, a shining moment in the career of a great director when everything was at its peak. Hayao Miyazaki’s skills in almost every aspect of animation are justly renowned, and nothing showcases them better than this film, so beautiful that every frame could hang on the walls of a gallery. (Many have done so, more than once.) Studio Ghibli produced this at the same time as _Grave of the Fireflies_ (1988), a pair of masterpieces on childhood and innocence exploring memories from the directors’ pasts. Miyazaki made some beautiful films after _Totoro_, but none would ever capture so honestly and precisely the glorious, unfathomable, heart-breaking fragility of a child’s world.<br>

_Totoro_ is among the simplest of films, one of very few with the courage to tell a child’s story from a child’s viewpoint at a child’s pace. Time is intensely important, but not fixed; it is measured by adult things, like watches or bus schedules, or by the movement of light across childhood afternoons. Two young sisters move with their father to the country to be near the hospital where their mother is being treated for a nameless illness that never quite goes away. The hospital is named for the one where Miyazaki’s mother was treated for spinal tuberculosis when he was a child. There is no villain, only the tiny conflicts all children experience. The girls discover the magic of nature and the unobtrusive kindness of the rural community. The older sister learns that death is not a man in a black hat, an enemy to be fought, but a fact of life that changes it forever, although its beauty endures.<br>

This is a film in which everything that will ever be important happens without anything much happening at all. Every frame is packed with life – intensely observed, scrupulously presented, passionately loved. Totoro’s forest remains evergreen because there is more intensity and passion invested in any given frame than some franchises muster across an expensive multi-part run. The film’s initial lack of box-office success gave way to a long run as Ghibli’s biggest earner, largely by turning that dedication and commitment to making something beautiful into a delightful range of merchandise.<br>

The woods, valleys and small farms that Miyazaki documents with such a depth of tenderness have now been built over, swallowed by the expansion of Tokyo. _Totoro_, however, endures, a remembered dream flying across a sky of perfect blue in a landscape that will never fade or die. If Miyazaki had never made another film, he would still be one of the greatest of all directors.<br> 
**Helen McCarthy, _Sight & Sound_, Summer 2020**<br>

Studio Ghibli was established after the success of _Nausicaä: Valley of the Wind_ (1984) specifically for the production of Hayao Miyazaki’s follow-up, the Swiftian tale of airborne adventure, _Laputa: Castle in the Sky_ (1986). However, it was the double-billing of his next title with Isao Takahata’s tonally quite different _Grave of the Fireflies_ that really cemented the position of Japan’s best-loved animation house on its home turf.<br>

Ironically, at the time, _My Neighbour Totoro_ was seen as the lesser of the pair. Nevertheless, this touching tale of two sisters who move with their father to a rickety wooden house in the country to be closer to their mother convalescing in a nearby hospital has gone on to achieve classic status. A celebration of the childhood imagination, it retains a freshness and originality that appears almost naive to modern viewers, and can be described (alongside 1992’s _Porco Rosso_) as the most personal and heartfelt of Miyazaki’s creations, with its setup stemming from an episode from his own youth when his mother was bed-bound with spinal tuberculosis.<br>

A rich fantasy world beneath the ordinary is unveiled before our eyes as the girls explore their new environment, full of tiny spider-like creatures scuttling through the rafters and other strange supernatural beings invisible to adults. These include the huge woolly beastie of the title, hidden deep within the nearby forest, who would become the most iconic of Ghibli’s creations.<br>
