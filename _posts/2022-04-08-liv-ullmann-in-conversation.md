_We’re delighted that Liv Ullmann returns to BFI Southbank to talk about her extraordinary career in film and television as part of our season celebrating the much-admired actor-director. We’ll gain valuable insights into her work with Ingmar Bergman and her subsequent role as a director herself, and we’ll explore an extensive career that has seen her recognised as one of Europe’s greatest actors and recently awarded an Honorary Oscar®. Hosted by  Christina Newland, Lead Film Critic, The i newspaper._

Liv Ullmann was born in Tokyo in 1938 and led an itinerant early life as her family followed her father’s engineering work around the world. After his death in an accident when she was only six, Ullmann, her mother and her sister returned to Norway, settling in Trondheim.

Ullmann began her stage acting career in the 1950s. But it was encountering Ingmar Bergman, Sweden’s prolific theatre-maker and burgeoning genius of film, that would position her for legendary status both as a star in her own right and as part of an extraordinarily rich creative partnership. Already acquainted with Ullmann’s close friend Bibi Andersson, Bergman cast them together in _Persona_ (1966), a seminal work that has lost none of its power to unsettle, provoke and inspire.

The ensuing romantic relationship brought a daughter – the journalist and author Linn Ullmann – while their artistic collaboration on films such as  _The Passion of Anna_ (1969), _Cries and Whispers_ (1972), _Face to Face_ (1976) and _Autumn Sonata_ (1978) made movie history. Their friendship endured until his death, with Ullmann revisiting her _Scenes from a Marriage_ character for Bergman’s swansong film _Saraband_ in 2003.

Ullmann also built a substantial career beyond Bergman, including an Oscar-nominated performance in Jan Troell’s _The Emigrants_ (1971). She made her first film as a director, _Sofie_, in 1992. She would go on to direct two Bergman scripts, _Private Confessions_ (1996) and _Faithless_ (2000), and a television version of August Strindberg’s _Miss Julie_ (2014), starring Jessica Chastain.

She also continued to work in theatre as both actor and director, bringing a definitive embodiment of _Anna Christie_ to the Broadway stage in 1977, and directing Cate Blanchett in the Sydney Theatre Company’s hit 2009 production of _A Streetcar Named Desire_.

Ullmann now lives in Key Largo, Florida. Interest in her work and in the extraordinary creative chemistry she shared with Bergman is high, with Bergman the subject of numerous documentary studies, _Scenes from a Marriage_ recently remade by HBO with Chastain and Oscar Isaac, and  Mia Hansen-Løve’s _Bergman Island_ (2021) probing the mythology of  creative coupledom.

**Liv Ullmann on the mystery of performance**  
I always felt that being an actor was humble, or not real, or whatever – I was ashamed if people knew I was an actor. Then I directed my first movie, _Sofie_ [1992]. There was a big close-up of [Karen-Lise Mynster as] Sofie. She was talking about being in love. And I was thinking to myself, ‘Try not to think what you would have done!’ And then I said, ‘Camera, go’ – and suddenly she was doing so much that I had never even thought of. Because actors are creative. And – this is the truth – it was the first time in my life that I was proud to be an actress. Because I saw that it didn’t come from make-believe, it came  from feeling.

A film I did with Ingmar, _The Passion of Anna_ (1969) – my character has lost her husband and boy in a traffic accident; she was driving the car. And Ingmar never goes into what you are thinking – the words are there, and the words are tremendously important to him, but he allows your fantasy and your inner life to be very much part of it also. I had a long monologue talking about the accident. He said, ‘You know, when she’s talking about the accident – she’s a murderer.’ And I said, ‘No!’ It was the first time I’d protested. I was like Ingrid Bergman – I said, ‘I can’t do that; I can’t be a murderer!’ He said, ‘Well, do it your way. But when you are describing the accident, just take a pause and think about what you’re going to say.’

The camera rolls, and I say, ‘I had this wonderful, wonderful marriage, and then this accident happened.’ And I took the pause. And I took another pause, and thought about what I was saying, and I started to say it: ‘…while we were driving, my husband was telling me that he wanted to leave me, and take my son with him, and I drove and drove, and I saw a lot of stones in front of me, and I drove right into the stones...’ Suddenly the stones were there. Suddenly, she was a murderer. With this genius little thing – ‘Think about what you’re saying’ – I did it like I had killed them on purpose, which I had never planned  to do.

That explains why Ingmar was always working with the same people. I don’t mean it was just us certain ones – if he’d been in LA or in Germany, other people would have done it – but he knew he needed that kind of actor. It comes from somewhere within. I saw today, there was a little girl in a bomb shelter, in the horrible war that’s going on, and she was singing – I’m sure you will see it. That was so real. I believe that in golden moments, that’s what an actor can do.
