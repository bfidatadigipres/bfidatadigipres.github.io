**Paul Verhoeven interviewed by Kleber Mendonça Filho**

_When I visited the_ Benedetta _shoot almost four years ago in Italy, on a very hot day, the scene I saw being shot was part of the insurrection at the end of the film.  And when I finally saw the film, it felt right to see that revolution, it feels timely._ Benedetta _also felt quite sharp in a number of ways._

Well, basically there is – let’s say – a 6th of January kind of feeling in the revolution at the end, isn’t there? But again, when we did it, we based it on certain things that had happened in the 17th century. Although the revolution at the end, that is really not part of the real historical Benedetta narrative. In the book by Judith C. Brown [_Immodest Acts_], there is no revolution. We added that because we felt we needed something that was really explosive at the end. The rest of the narrative in _Benedetta_ is pretty close to what we know historically about her, which was all found by Judith Brown in the 80s in the archives of Florence. So we used the book really in an abundant way, but added a couple of things like the revolution to make it a movie.

_With everything that’s been happening, and so fast, that shoot in Bevagna feels like the distant past. How are you thinking about movies now?_

It is a long time ago that I did this movie. It’s like an alien project for me because  it’s been such a long time. At this moment, I would prefer to do a movie for a bigger audience.

_I see._ Benedetta _is a third European film after a strong Hollywood run. To me, it feels you make films which are personal in style and points of view no matter how different the scale of each project is, or where you make them._

Well, of course, the movies I did in Holland, the budgets were from half a million to about 5 million for a film like _Soldier of Orange_ [1977] – and that was guilders, not even euros. And then, in the United States, it went from 13 million for _RoboCop_ [1987] to 45 million for _Total Recall_ [1990]. And further on, _Basic Instinct_ [1992] and then even more, with _Starship Troopers_ [1997] and _Hollow Man_ [2000] costing more than 100 million. But in _Starship Troopers_ the budget for the special effects, the animals and the spaceships and all that stuff, was already 50 million.  You needed this to create a world that is in some way at least believable.

It’s more that the money basically is related to the content of the movie. _Turkish Delight_ [1973], which was less than 1 million to make at that time, that was, let’s say, mostly a boy and a girl doing things to each other, but no big scenes. There were no battles; no special effects were necessary. Of course, you didn’t need $40 million to shoot that. But you could not do _Starship Troopers_ or _Hollow Man_ without the 100 million.

I’m still living in LA, but after _Hollow Man_ I felt that I was on the wrong road. That I was really becoming, let’s say, a studio director. Because the things I really wanted to do were not possible any more, the story was basically, ‘It should not be too much of this and not too much of that,’ and ‘Be careful here,’ and ‘We want to see that, and this and that.’ And ultimately I decided to abandon making these big movies and went back to Europe to make something that I liked. And so I did  _Black Book_ [2006] and _Elle_ [2016] and _Benedetta_. _Benedetta_ was mostly filmed in a square in Bevagna and two monasteries in the south of France. There is one [revolution] scene with a lot of people, but that was shot in three days rather than 30 days. _Elle_ cost 7.8 million [euros], I think. _Benedetta_, 17, 18 or so. Double, in fact. _Elle_ was basically three, four, five characters rotating around each other, more in the direction of _Turkish Delight_ than _Starship Troopers_.

_There is a select group of filmmakers who have changed gears between two notable – and very different – film cultures: Hollywood and France. You are one of those very few._

Well, I do not feel that I’m alienated from Hollywood! There’s a lot of talent here. Basically, there is an enormous amount of good writers that, let’s say, in France I find more difficult. On the other hand, the quality of the actors and notably, lately, of the actresses is fantastic in France, and so are the crews. But when I was doing _Black Book_ or _Elle_ or _Benedetta_, you know that you are not talking to a very general audience. You are aware that you’re making more of what you would call an ‘art film’ than a commercial film. And after doing [that] three times, I would like now to come back to a more, let’s say, a _North by Northwest_ [1959] kind of story, à la Hitchcock in the United States. ‘Commercial’ is a bad word for it… Something for a bigger audience. _Lawrence of Arabia_ [1962] is for a bigger audience, as is _Doctor Zhivago_ [1965], and _The Godfather_ [1972]. You can be impressed by what the directors, the screenwriter, the actors have done but it is still something that everybody watches. They are very direct, these movies.

I know it’s a big word to use, but _Elle_ and _Benedetta_ are, in some way, nearly Brechtian. The audience should not be identifying with the characters. You look at the characters but you cannot identify with them, you cannot go with them.  A woman who is raped and who then starts a sadomasochistic relationship with the rapist, that’s not normal. And Isabelle Huppert or Virginie Efira, you don’t know exactly where they stand with their characters, what’s there, because they don’t act in a very normal way. So, that’s difficult for the audience. Of course, if you look at _North by Northwest_, then you are going along with Cary Grant. You are, as an audience, Cary Grant. You live like him. And that is the opposite of Brecht. In fact, are you aware that _Benedetta_ was originally written by Gerard Soeteman?

_Yes, of course._

Gerard Soeteman wrote all my Dutch movies, including _Black Book_, _Flesh+Blood_ [1985], _Turkish Delight_, _Keetje Tippel_ [1975], _Soldier of Orange_. But I think we got into a problem because I felt that, in this case, you should not identify with the main character [played by] Virginie Efira. You should not know or understand or participate and go along with her. Gerard wanted much more that you go with Virginie. You would see it from her point of view. For him, it was really a woman who is gathering power. That is still true in the movie, but I felt that for me, it was more about these two women, Bartolomea and Benedetta. Benedetta wants power but she wants power to basically become the abbess. And as she becomes the abbess, she gets her own room. And if she gets her own room, she can lock it and have sex with Bartolomea.

So I said the lesbian factor was as important as the power factor. If you look at her visions where Jesus says, ‘Be careful, don’t do that, [don’t have] sex with that girl.’ And finally Jesus says basically, more or less, you can take your clothes off because with me, there is no shame. And he advises her, or promotes even, the idea that she should finally have sex with Bartolomea... That’s my line in the movie. Gerard’s line was more in the way of her need for power: she wants power.

I felt the position of a lesbian woman in 1625 was more important than her looking for power, which she did anyhow. But I felt the sexual connotations were more relevant. And so we broke up after 50 years, and now we are not even friends any more because of this.

_I’m sorry to hear that you and Gerard have parted ways, it was such a strong and long collaboration. So, there is still a lot of Gerard’s work in the finished script?_

Absolutely. My additions to the screenplay of _Benedetta_ are perhaps ten or 15 per cent, basically, but Gerard’s participation I think is 50 or 60 per cent. But he didn’t want his name there. You can see his work in the smallest details, all kinds of stuff. For example, when Bartolomea makes the dildo, and then Virginie says, ‘It’s a bit sharp.’ Bartolomea replies, ‘I will fix it. You take your clothes over there,’ that’s Gerard. Even that kind of detail. I think it was really strange, and a pity. A pity, because I think his name should have been there [in the credits]. But yeah,  that’s life.
