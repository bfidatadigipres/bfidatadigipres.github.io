The mid-1970s were not an auspicious time to launch into feature film production. In 1975 the British film industry was collapsing fast. Cinema admissions had been falling rapidly since the 50s (in 1959 they had totalled 601 million, by 1970 they were down to 193 million and by 1975 to 116 million). The brief heyday of the 60s had gone – and the industry was largely at the mercy of the Americans. The Eady levy system – established in 1947 to assist home-produced films by allocating a proportion of global box-office receipts to British production – was in need of restructuring. Jarman’s three feature films were financed from private sources. _Sebastiane_ was made in 16mm on a budget of £30,000 brought ‘in briefcases from a shipping magnate’.

Though _Sebastiane_ represents a break with the poetic and experimental forms of Jarman’s smaller-gauge films, it nevertheless carries forward some of their concerns, in particular an interest in the mythological aspect of the subject and a tendency to express emotions through the image rather than through the acting. But _Sebastiane_ also represents a move from private to public filmmaking. The gentle camp eroticism and personalised mythology and symbolism of the Super-8s is replaced by an aggressive directness that is both socio-political and institutional.

Probably the most innovative aspect of _Sebastiane_, besides its homoeroticism, is the Latin dialogue. Jack Welch, a Latin scholar from Oxford, translated the script, a first in cinema history. Peter Wollen has commented that the ‘high camp’ Latin dialogue makes the experience of the film like that of watching an opera with a libretto in a foreign language, thus foregrounding the role of performance and visual composition. For Wollen this feature of the film renders it modernist, although ironically so due to the film’s ostensible realism.  The strong guttural sounds have little to do with the tones of a Latin mass; in _Sebastiane_ Latin is the language of the streets, aggressive, lascivious, well suited to lust and rage.

_Sebastiane_ was shot at Cala Domestica in Sardinia, using a ruined fisherman’s house as both the set and the living quarters for the actors and crew. When Joe Dallesandro, the star of the Warhol/ Morrissey films, turned up, Jarman refused to use him despite the pleas of his co-workers, instinctively realising that such a move would ‘completely unbalance the cast who are all equally unknown’. At another point there was a walkout on the set when the crew accused him of ‘fucking exploitation’ and being a ‘pornographer’ when Adrian (Ken Hicks) could not achieve an erection for a love scene. Even at this point in his career, Jarman was not afraid of being thought politically incorrect or of standing against the conventions of the gay subculture in which he operated in order to achieve the image he wanted.

Jarman was not a novice of feature filmmaking – after all, he had had the experience of working with a ‘difficult’ director on _The Devils_ and _Savage Messiah_ and of major ballet and opera productions, but the weight of responsibility for his own film must have been another matter. It was obviously an intense learning experience in which he showed his ability not only to take on others’ ideas but to know when to stick to his own whatever the opposition.

Richard Dyer remarks that _Sebastiane_ ‘astonishingly and fortuitously’ received a commercial release in Britain. The review of Jarman’s film in _Gay News_ indicates its impact on the gay community:

‘Very occasionally there appears a film of such power and authority that one emerges from the cinema feeling somewhat shaken and disorientated … _Sebastiane_ is a very special, and indeed, a quite remarkable film that represents a milestone in the history of gay cinema.’

Nearly 20 years later, Jarman gave his own judgement:

‘_Sebastian_ [sic] didn’t present homosexuality as a problem and this was what made it different from all the British films that had preceded it. It was also homoerotic. The film was historically important; no feature film had ventured here. There had been underground films, _Un chant d’amour_ and _Fireworks_, but _Sebastian_ [sic] was in a public space.’

As a first film, _Sebastiane_ was a resounding success. It was rejected by Cannes but taken up by the Locarno Festival in June 1976 where it was loudly barracked by the audience, some of whom demanded the festival organiser’s resignation. But when the film opened at the Gate Cinema in Notting Hill it played to record audiences. It was ‘a stunning success’ in Italy and Spain, classed as a sex film in America, panned by the French and found difficult by the Germans.

The film has been unjustly criticised for its so-called controversial expression of the historical episode, especially since its imagery is very much at one with the traditional representation of the Sebastian story in paintings. Jarman mimics the _pietà_, while the execution and bathhouse scenes are handled very much in the style of classical art. By and large, though, the film lacks a rich context for its narrative. Jarman’s use of the theatrical and the _tableau vivant_ is limited to the first scene of the orgy, which in its campness makes a larger historical point about the Roman period of Diocletian but which carries no narrative weight. Campness and a postmodern-like bricolage were to become the methods by which Jarman made his political points. But in _Sebastiane_ he is reduced to the narrow canvas and simple actions of a plot centred on the scapegoating of his self-destructive hero.
