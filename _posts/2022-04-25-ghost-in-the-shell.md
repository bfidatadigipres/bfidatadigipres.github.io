Beautifully animated and disturbingly prophetic, _Ghost in the Shell_ is a futuristic tale centred on Public Security Section 9’s hunt for supreme hacker The Puppet Master. This is a world where governments are dependent on computer-controlled systems, and cyber-terrorists pose the biggest threat to global stability.<br>

I saw _Ghost in the Shell_ on its first limited cinema release in Britain, with a flatly delivered American dub. Back then, I thought it was dull despite its beauty. Rewatching _Ghost_ with subtitles helped, as did seeing its anime precursors. Oshii Mamoru’s political drama _Patlabor 2_ (1993) established much of _Ghost_’s sensibility. It contained a sequence that’s a wordless poem in pictures, showing Tokyo patrolled by the military, yet beautified by snow.

In _Ghost_, the equivalent sequence involves the film’s main character, Major Kusanagi. She’s an Internal Affairs agent, with a synthetic body but a human brain. In a city modelled on Hong Kong, Kusanagi hunts down a criminal, the Puppet Master, who hacks into people’s machine-meshed brains.

_Ghost_’s central sequence, wordless like the one in _Patlabor 2_, has Kusanagi passing along a canal through anonymous crowds. The images suggest a mire of decay (broken bicycles in mud) and disposability (Kusanagi glimpses replicas of her mass-produced body, including a mannequin in a shop window). Then rain falls, like a _deus ex machina_: at once everything is quickened, reanimated. Earlier, a voice out of nowhere whispered to her, quoting Saint Paul. ‘For now we see through a glass darkly.’

About a third of _Ghost_’s budget was provided by Britain’s Manga Entertainment, hoping for a spectacle like _Akira_ (1988). Indeed, _Ghost_ serves up ear-ringing gun battles, exploding heads and a heroine who dives down a skyscraper. The story has elements of _Blade Runner_ (1982) and cyberpunk fiction. Amusingly, _Ghost_ opened just as cyberpunk was being declared dead in Hollywood, thanks to the flops of _Johnny Mnemonic_ and _Strange Days_ (both 1995).

But _Ghost_’s intellectual detachment feels more Kubrickian. Near the end, there’s a perspective trick with a mirror, recalling the obelisk in the hotel in _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968). _Ghost_’s humanity comes from Kawai Kenji’s increasingly passionate score, and from the lead Japanese voice actors, who play seasoned secret agents with occasional glimpses of vulnerability. Kusanagi was voiced by Tanaka Atsuko, already established as the dub voice of Nicole Kidman. Tanaka later dubbed Scarlett Johansson in the Japanese release of the live-action _Ghost in the Shell_ remake (2017), an enjoyable travesty.

The compact anime, only 83 minutes long, had been skilfully arranged from select chapters of the source manga by Shirow Masamune. The strip was massively dense, but it had none of the sobriety Oshii brought to the film. However, viewers might have needed to have read Shirow’s manga to catch some of the story’s oblique points. In one scene, there’s an unexplained raid at a mansion. The manga clarifies this belongs to an exiled foreign colonel who the Foreign Ministry wants deported, which is the secret reason for all the action and carnage in the film’s first act.<br>
