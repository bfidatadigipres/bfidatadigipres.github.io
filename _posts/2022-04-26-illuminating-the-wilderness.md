_+ discussion with artists and makers from  Project Art Works_

_Illuminating the Wilderness_ offers a window onto the experiences of a group of neurodiverse artists, filmmakers, families and carers as they explore Glen Affric in the Scottish Highlands. Artists Ben Rivers and Margaret Salmon join the journey, which charts the pleasures and challenges of neurodiverse responses to the landscape with humour and tenderness.

Our post-screening discussion will consider perceptions of ‘wilderness’, experimental form and cultural inclusion. Screening with short films from Project Art Works. Nominated for both  The Jarman Award 2020 and The Turner Prize 2021, Project Art Works is a collective who work to increase representation of neuro-minorities in art and culture.

We have produced a booklet about _Illuminating the Wilderness_ which gives a transcript and more information about the making of the film. You can download here.
