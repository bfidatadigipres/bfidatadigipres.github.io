_Seul contre tous_ is a feature-length follow-up to Gaspar Noé’s acclaimed 1992 short _Carne_. In the earlier film the same unnamed central character, a dour butcher, brings up his possibly autistic daughter in a nightmarish world of blood, horsemeat, stunted relationships and frustrated sexual desire. With its disconcerting humming soundtrack, minimal dialogue and harshly drawn environment, _Carne_ is directly indebted to David Lynch’s _Eraserhead_, which Noé describes as ‘the closest thing to a nightmare’ he has seen on the screen.

Despite the success of _Carne_, which has been shown several times on French television and won Noé the support of a disparate group of luminaries after its screening at Cannes, the director had a hard time completing _Seul contre tous_, having been snubbed by France’s official funding mechanisms and Canal Plus. This accounts for the five-year gap between the films. Noé lists his supporters in the end credits of _Seul contre tous_, who include the fashion designer Agnès B and Dario Argento. Agnès B lent Noé funds at the point when he had used his own money – from sales of _Carne_ – to the point of bankruptcy. She is, says Noé, the saviour of his film.

Noé’s experience of the insecurities surrounding _Seul contre tous_ production history clearly added to his identification with his middle-aged hero: on one level the film is a feverish nightmare dreamed by and for precarious inhabitants of the flexible marketplace, in which the film industry is but one of many. But it is far more than this. The movie recaps, at the start, the butcher’s journey into penury after going to prison and losing his shop. He lives despairingly with his pregnant ex-bar-owner girlfriend, for whom he has nothing but loathing, in her elderly mother’s flat, which he finds disgusting and unhygienic. The butcher hates old people, but then he hates everybody and everything apart from the impossible memory of a father he never knew, a communist resistance hero who was murdered in the death camps. The butcher gets a job in a rest home for the elderly, impassively helps a young female nurse when a resident dies, and is seen by a nosy neighbour walking the distressed young woman home. He visits a porn cinema where his misanthropic disgust finds a corollary in the humanity reduced to bodily functions on the screen (‘the people who do that know the meaning of our species,’ his inner voice rails). When his mistress begins a grotesque argument, accusing him of infidelity, the butcher explodes, punching her repeatedly in the stomach to kill the baby. Taking the old woman’s gun containing three bullets, and with a dwindling 300 francs between himself and destitution, he hitches a ride to Paris where his misanthropy reaches fever pitch.

_Seul contre tous_ is a dark, uncompromising feelbad masterpiece, which could appropriately have been called _Hate_ had not Mathieu Kassovitz’s _La Haine_ got there first. It is tempting to see in it the seething underbelly of the French heritage movie which largely defined that national cinema for foreign audiences before _La Haine_. But this would miss the point. Noé is both scathing and dismissive about what he described to me as, ‘the huge family of soft bourgeois French cinema’. His film instead emerges from his enthusiasm for a body of powerful movies from the US and UK – including _Straw Dogs_, _Taxi Driver_ and Alan Clarke’s _Scum_ – which uncomfortably implicate the spectator in hermetic microcosms of misanthropy. Noé is devoted to these films as high points of the cinema of confrontation, and is of a generation that shares the current nostalgia for a time when transgression seemed to matter.

I would suggest that this is not because these films play with assumed cinematic norms of propriety but because they disregard audience comfort and can be appreciated as undiluted expressions of the creative delirium of their making. Unlike François Ozon, Noé is sceptical about cinema’s power to shock. Reality is too shocking for that – movies, no matter what the Dogme movement claims, are just illusion. Noé says he has rarely been shocked by cinema – but was when a lightweight French television comedy show invited National Front leader Jean-Marie le Pen on to crack jokes. But he does know the power of the feigned outrage the tabloids and institutions of censorship periodically invoke to represent the fears and anxieties of, largely, non-cinemagoers. Noé claims to have wanted his film banned at least somewhere to prove its confrontational power. Instead, as _Seul contre tous_ awaits its 16 certificate in France, a film he had expected to alienate 90 per cent of its audience and draw flak from feminist groups, gay groups, anti-racist campaigners and conservatives has been lavishly praised by the press, communist and conservative alike. Maybe he takes some comfort from the fact that exhibitors in Paris have refused to show it because they are afraid, he says, of sharing his point of view.

The point of view at stake, though, is the butcher’s, to whom France is a country of ‘cheese- and Nazi-lovers’ (Noé illustrates this with a photograph of Petain shaking hands with Hitler); of ‘nigger faggots’ (like a bar owner’s son who is probably neither from an ethnic minority nor gay); and of ‘faggots in suits’ (like the abattoir owner who makes him fill out an application form knowing he is not going to give him work). Noé unsettles us with unexpected zooms accompanied by non-diegetic gunshots, with bold captions bearing the legends ‘Morality’, ‘Justice’ or ‘Faggot’. But his central technique is continuously to expose us to the butcher’s hate-filled interior monologue in voice-over. It is this verbal _tour de force_ that reminds French reviewers of the rabidly deep pessimism, grotesque black humour and liberating linguistic intoxication of controversial novelist Céline. Some of this verbal feverishness is necessarily sacrificed in the subtitling, and Noé apparently spent much time with the translator trying to devise an English equivalent of the singular mix of homophobia and racism in the phrase ‘_encule de ta race_’ (Noé’s solution – ‘you buttfuck race’ – was deemed clumsy).

Noé’s butcher is stripped down to his basic needs – food, shelter, sex – and looking as though he will be denied even these, he tries to embrace nihilism as an absolute truth that will guide him to a reason for living for another 20 years. The exaggeration of his truly miserable experience in a world of uncompromising harshness where ‘each man makes his own morality’ permeates Noé’s movie. Noé claims it is a funny film – and indeed there is pitch-black comedy. It is embedded partly in discomforting truths about men and violence which cinema has done more than any other medium to obscure. And there is humour – and not a little fear too – in the moment when a caption appears telling us we have ‘30 seconds to leave the cinema’. It counts down for us, knowing we will stay put, that in the darkness of the cinema, unlike in life, we are unshockable. It is, says Noé, a joke – but what follows is no fun at all. It tests any belief we may have in the possibility of redemption, the existence of love and our own humanity as well as our nostalgia for, and acceptance of, a cinema of transgression to some kind of limit. For now.
