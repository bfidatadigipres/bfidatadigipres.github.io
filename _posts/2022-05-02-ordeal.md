**The films of the New French Extremity and the accompanying focus on Gaspar Noé examine an important, controversial and highly violent cinema movement. They are not suitable for all.**

**The film you are about to watch may contain very dark themes, graphic imagery, and scenes of a very upsetting nature including sexual violence and body horror.**

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

When Marc (Laurent Lucas), a cabaret singer heading from one Christmas performance to another, breaks down in the woods, he’s left with little choice but to follow the strange man searching for his dog to a secluded inn run by one Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). Bartel warns him to stay away from the local village, but it’s quickly apparent that the villagers are the least of Marc’s problems. Knocked unconscious, stripped and dressed as the innkeeper’s long-gone wife, Marc’s ordeal reaches its peak in a brutal overhead tracking shot as the village men descend on the inn.

Director Fabrice du Welz works wonders with atmospheric textures, a dance sequence in the village bar playing like a psychotic outtake from Bela Tarr’s _Sátántangó_ (1994). That stalwart of French cinematic grimness, Philippe Nahon, shows up as leader of the village loons, but _Calvaire_’s trump card is undoubtedly Berroyer’s Bartel. Despite being so obviously unhinged, there’s something oddly touching in his joy at a first family Christmas in years – even if said family consists of another deranged yokel, a sodomised cow and a crying man dressed as his dead wife.  
**Matthew Thrift, bfi.org.uk**

In the wake of Gaspar Noé’s _Irreversible_ and Alexandre Aja’s _Switchblade Romance_ (not to mention Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi’s _Baise-moi_) comes another gruelling European endurance test straddling the divide between American grind-house cinema and continental arthouse experimentation. Chillingly lensed by Benoît Debie (DoP on _Irreversible_ and Dario Argento’s _The Card Player_), and boasting another impressively worrying appearance by the monumental Philippe Nahon, _Calvaire_ is a stripped-down, surrealist (and borderline satirical) slasher yarn in which a naive young singer is stranded in a Grimm-ly darkened wood where he swiftly falls prey to monstrous desires. With an unsettling soundtrack which slips from easy-listening sentimentality to carnivalesque grotesquerie via a cacophony of animal grunts and inhuman groans, this is a claustrophobic mood piece notable for its pervasive sense of melancholic nastiness, a nastiness that is undercut only by its rankly knowing genre-literacy.

‘Obstinacy is the key to everything!’ announces insane innkeeper Bartel (Jackie Berroyer), whose grief at the loss of his spouse has robbed him of both his award-winning sense of humour and his grip upon reality. Offering Marc Stevens (the lurking Laurent Lucas) refuge in his run-down hotel, Bartel mistakes the fey singer for his errant wife and vows that he/she will never leave him again. Meanwhile, Bartel’s troubled companion Boris (Jean-Luc Couchard) – an inbred cousin of one of David Lynch’s woodland eccentrics – makes a similarly obsessive imaginative leap, stealing a cow he thinks is his lost dog, and thus bringing down the wrath of the bestial local villagers who are ‘not like you and me’. From the dreamy grey-green mistiness of the forests of Belgium’s Hautes Fagnes region, to the blood-red interiors of Bartel’s private hell, Fabrice du Welz’s gruelling feature debut lumbers engagingly between satire and sadism as it drags the audience through a catalogue of tortures (including gang and animal rape) designed to achieve a strange blend of the ‘aggressive  and poetic’.

The title _Calvaire_ invokes the martyrdom of Christ, signalled on screen by an enigmatic crucifixion in the film’s final reel. Fittingly, Marc’s symbolic role is to take upon himself the sins of the world into which he has stumbled, becoming a focal point for the unrequited desires of all those whom he encounters. In an early scene, an elderly woman to whom he has crooned seductively from the stage, mistakes his act for projected passion. Later, a cache of furtive Polaroids reveals the depths of another admirer’s longing. Yet it is only when Marc meets the doggedly obstinate Bartel that the preening star learns the true price of enduring love. The fact that Bartel’s nemesis turns out to be the physically similar Robert Orton (Nahon), a villager with whom the innkeeper’s late wife seems to have been intimately acquainted, adds a slyly soap-operatic twist to the proceedings, even as events veer ever further into the realms of screaming madness.

Lifting its narrative riffs from a string of well-recognised shockers (the male-rape anxieties of _Deliverance_; the twisted fandom of _Misery_, the siege mentality of _Straw Dogs_) and playfully nodding toward a string of cult-movie connections (the name Bartel references the writer-director-star of _Eating Raoul_); Jo Prestia, who played the rapist in _Irreversible_, appears as a farmer), _Calvaire_’s savage bite is constantly softened by its cinematic self-referentiality. One sequence, depicting a grisly Christmas celebration at which Marc/Gloria is an unwilling guest, exactly mimics the dinner-table scene from _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_, right down to the gurning shots of howling rustics and extreme close-ups of victimised eyeballs. The most effective scene, in which the sinister villagers engage in an increasingly frenzied zombie dance, recalls the ending of _The Wicker Man_, in which the hero is gaily burned alive to the strains of ‘Summer Is A-Comen In’.

As a cleansing snow settles on _Calvaire_’s other-worldly finale, one is left with a dreamy sense of having been here several times before, often in more original circumstances. It’s derivative stuff, and unashamedly so. Yet the haunting tunes and vile images which litter this lovelorn journey have a deeper and more haunting resonance than its magpie surface may imply.
