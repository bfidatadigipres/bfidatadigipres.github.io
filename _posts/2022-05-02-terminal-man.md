**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
In 1969 the first hapless chimpanzee was directly linked by radio to a computer which took over the functioning of its brain. In 1971, according to Michael Crichton, the first human could have been similarly implanted, and with his novel _The Terminal Man_ he set out to demonstrate the method and the possible consequences of placing the brain under artificial control. Crichton’s case is so plausible it sounds like yesterday’s news – more of a post-mortem than a warning (if warning it is; there is a characteristic ambivalence here). A patient is fitted with a tiny computer connected to wires inserted in the brain, intended to nullify the homicidal effects of brain damage; but his brain finds the computer’s signals so pleasant that he is soon stimulated into a state of perpetual violence. He wanders the city in this malfunctioning condition, somewhat to the detriment of friends and acquaintances, until cured like so many renegades by a gunshot or two. One recalls that in _The Andromeda Strain_ and in _Westworld_, Crichton went sailing off into melodrama for the concluding scenes.

The film of _Terminal Man_, adapted and directed with admirable assurance by Mike Hodges (who made _Get Carter_ and _Pulp_), is faithful to both the best and the worst of Crichton. With the spectacular assistance of Richard Kline’s photography, Hodges creates a mood of precarious efficiency that exactly catches the Crichton tone. In their crystal labyrinth of screens, monitors and mirrors, his hospital characters tremble with the unrecognised expectation of failure, checking printouts like horoscopes before daring to operate. Their maverick victim is one of the four million Americans still behaving irrationally in a society where computerisation toils for order and method. Man is not, Crichton would remind us (like Asimov and Clarke and, dare one say, Mary Shelley before him), an exclusively rational creature; to ignore his innate perversity is to increase the chances of breakdown. Hodges picks up Crichton’s cues and improvises superbly: as orderlies snigger coarsely in the corners in the tradition of Frankenstein’s imbecilic assistants, the brain surgeons posture with fragile arrogance, vomiting with terror before the operation, smug at its apparent success, and stunned when it goes wrong.

On one level, _Terminal Man_ is about vanity, its causes and its consequences. On the surface, most obviously, it’s about light and dark, a formal counterbalance used by Hodges in a sometimes effective, sometimes pretentious manner. For the opening shot, a helicopter rises slowly through darkness until its spotlight dazzles the camera lens; George Segal, bound for computerised zombiehood, is wheeled from the night into the false daylight of the hospital, eventually to be swallowed again by darkness as the camera pans down the walls of his grave. Hodges constantly poses white figures against black, or stands them awkwardly among blocks of monochrome furniture, incompatible with physical or mental comfort; the listless party sequence and the frankly unbelievable environment of the psychiatrist’s home are settings that reinforce the sense that man is gradually programming himself to extinction.

At times like the splendid tracking shot across row after row of desk screens on which Segal is describing his fears of mechanical superiority, Hodges is impressively precise in style. Elsewhere, as in the big murder scene, he simply seems to have tried too hard: a parrot trembles in its cage, an extract from _Them_ whistles suspensefully on the television set, a girl paints her fingernails black, and the killer’s eyes snap open. We are in for high-gloss mayhem – all splashing blood and punctured waterbed and fluttering rose-petals. In slow-motion, accompanied by Bach, and rounded off by close-ups of the formal patterns of flowing liquid, the sequence ends in a kind of vulgarised beauty.

Even at its worst – in the crude suspense of a fist breaking through a locked door or the colourful but idiotic scenes at the cemetery – _Terminal Man_ certainly makes good watching. And if George Segal has little opportunity to do more than roll his eyes and intensify his air of dejected preoccupation, it’s pleasing to see Joan Hackett again, coping in wistful horror with a world of wisecracking chauvinist surgeons and suicidal patients. That Hodges (not Crichton) gives her a quote from _The Wasteland_ and plants her cowering in the bathroom as the killer pounds up the stairs, seems an act of fate rather than of misjudgment; she has the exact vulnerability for either extreme. We could have done with the likes of her in _Westworld_ (which Crichton wrote almost simultaneously with _Terminal Man_), and the likes of Hodges too, for that matter. The story of a robotic monster bent on vengeance, however, could perhaps be allowed to rest now for a year or so.
