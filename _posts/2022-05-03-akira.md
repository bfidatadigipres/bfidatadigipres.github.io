**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_Akira_ is very probably the first animated feature with a genuinely novelistic density of incident and character. Its narrative speed and complexity are such that viewers who come to it without prior knowledge of the manga (comic-strip) version tend to find it almost overpowering. On the other hand, viewers who see it while engrossed in the original find it a sophisticated reinvention of its source. _Akira_ the film uses the same characters and more or less the same incidents as _Akira_ the graphic novel, but innumerable points of detail are changed and the film’s patterns of parallel action are quite different in structure and pace from the original. The film virtually demands to be ‘read’ alongside the manga, and amounts to a kind of commentary on it.

Otomo’s storyline is not particularly groundbreaking as science fiction. The film version sits comfortably between _Blade Runner_ and _2001_: urban dystopia meets the next link in the evolutionary chain. At this level, Otomo’s main achievement is probably the sheer credibility of his vision of futuretech, as seen in the fully thought-through designs of vehicles and laboratory equipment. Where the story possibly does go beyond such latterday staples of American SF as cyborgs and replicants is in its linkage of psychic powers with genetic mutation: the story’s premise (concealed in the film until it approaches its climax) is that Akira’s unprecedented psychic development produced molecular changes that touched off a massive, silent cataclysm.

New or not, this conceptual nicety yields some extremely arresting images in the film’s closing scenes. The Tokyo independent filmmaker Shinya Tsukamoto has already picked up Otomo’s concept in a series of resourceful movies about humans mutating into metallic grotesques; Tsukamoto’s most ambitious film to date is called, logically enough, _Tetsuo_.

SF trappings aside, Otomo’s story undergoes some fairly remarkable mutations of its own. It starts out embroiled in a feud between pill-popping delinquent bikers, broadens to take in terrorist guerrillas, demented scientists and a military coup, and winds up envisaging the birth of a new universe. This ‘exploding’ structure would seem unprecedented if it were not for King Hu’s equally singular _A Touch of Zen_, which also expanded its frame of reference from the domestic to the political to the cosmic. The correspondence is no doubt purely coincidental, but Otomo echoes King Hu in using a simple psychological gestalt to keep his microcosmic bikers in balance with his macrocosmic rebirths.

Tetsuo’s problem is that he has been bullied ever since he arrived in the orphanage where Kaneda became his ‘elder brother’ and protector, and the film’s sub-text is Tetsuo’s gradual but decisive emergence from his place in Kaneda’s shadow. The climactic scenes are interrupted by collective flashbacks to the childhoods of the central characters. First, to the orphanage where Kaneda and Tetsuo met; then, to the colonel’s research centre, where Kiyoko, Masaru, Takashi and the perennially youthful Akira underwent their induced psychic growth. What makes these flashbacks so poignant and affecting is their origin in shared memories, which successfully implies the way that those doing the remembering are about to be subsumed into a new collective identity. But there is also a deep pathos in the way that Otomo draws and colours them, far removed from the high-tech cityscapes and hard-edged action of the rest of the film. They resemble nothing so much as frames from one of Hiroshi Shimizu’s vintage movies about childhood (say, _The Introspection_ _Tower_, 1941), which also dealt with questions like bullying and rebellion against authority.

Simply as animation, _Akira_ is an undoubted tour de force. It preserves the extraordinarily detailed graphic style of Otomo’s original-drawings and matches it with equally detailed multi-planed movement and a colour spectrum that prefers shades to bold primaries. The most spectacular set-piece is the psychic attack on Tetsuo by Kiyoko, Masaru and Takashi, a self-defeating stunt involving toys and other tokens of childhood, but comparable visual and aural dynamics can be found throughout, even in the simplest scenes of exposition. It helps no end that the animators worked to a pre-recorded dialogue track; this obviously guided the film’s pacing, but it also gives the action far more dramatic immediacy than is usual in animated features.

Time and again, the film avoids aesthetically predictable decisions. The music, for example, is neither screaming electric guitar solos nor grandiose ‘new age’ noises but a surprisingly low-key, post-rock score in which wordless vocal sounds play a large part. The action does unfold in robustly physical terms, with a great deal of violence and a great many explosions, but the film’s centre is still and quiet. Beyond all the terrestrial and cosmic cataclysms (Otomo, one guesses, subscribes to the ‘big bang’ theory of the origin of universes), _Akira_ manages to express a particular kind of adolescent confusion and despair, locating it precisely between a disturbing vision of childhood and a sense that adult ‘maturity’ is a sham. Its sensibility is closer to Nicholas Ray than Ralph Bakshi, let alone the dozens of also-rans in the field of Japanese animation.<br>
