‘_Black Rainbow_ is a crossroads of many different ideas,’ says writer/director Mike Hodges. ‘I’m concerned about what we’re doing to our planet and I’m interested in the revival of numerous kinds of religion, evangelism and the new age of spiritualism. We have this wonderful place we call God’s Kingdom – a place of beauty and serenity. But we are destroying it and not looking after what is now rapidly vanishing. I wanted to make a thriller encompassing all these subjects. The idea of a medium gave me the vehicle to carry the various strands I was trying to work into the piece.’

No newcomer to the arenas of fantasies, thrillers or controversial movies, as _Flash Gordon_, _Get Carter_ and _A Prayer for the Dying_ prove, Hodges was inspired to write the screenplay for _Black Rainbow_ after filming in North Carolina in 1985. He made the TV movie _Florida Straits_ there and was struck by how the devoutly religious area seemed caught between the atmosphere of the Forties and the Eighties.

‘_Florida Straits_ was the worst experience of my professional life until _A Prayer for the Dying_,’ says Hodges, who began his directing career on the _World in Action_ series for Granada Television in 1963. ‘But it worked out in retrospect because I knew the town of Charlotte and that it would be the perfect location for a film and I was determined to set a story there one day.’

_Black Rainbow_ turned out as a result to be the most personal screenplay Hodges ever wrote. Hodges was a full-time drama writer before opting for directing and he explains, ‘My feelings are very deep about the issues the film addresses. I feel we’ve got ourselves, and our world, into a serious predicament. You read about it daily. Maybe it’s because we’ve turned our backs on all things mysterious. What we can’t understand or scientifically explain, we reject out of hand. We live in such materialistic times, we reject anything to do with the unconscious.’

He continues, ‘After all, our ancestors looked after the earth with care. Its preservation was built into their philosophy. We not only reject their wisdom, we even tried to destroy them with it. Surely there is a direct link between the way we treat our environment and the fact that we have no time to dwell on anything anymore. It’s an age of distractions and we literally end up ignoring the very place we are living in, which could be the important key to understanding ourselves.’

Hodges believes in the power of telepathy, the basis from which he started writing the _Black Rainbow_ script in 1986. He remarks, ‘All I’ve done is put a feeler out for discussion saying there may be things we don’t understand but at least we should be trying. Most of the information that seems to come up at these mass public psychic displays put on by mediums is usually personal trivia. Mediums seem to pick up on people’s thoughts which they then embellish with all their own dreams of what it’s supposed to be like on  The Other Side. They act like human radio receivers collecting subconscious wavelengths. But nobody has proved there is an “over there” yet. And that’s as far as I wanted to go with the subject in the script.’

Hodges continued, ‘There are all sorts of phenomena we don’t understand: why under hypnosis someone has three or four different personalities; why birds migrate; what causes mass hysteria? We seem scared witless to study extraordinary phenomena because, if we did, it would possibly reveal that it’s our egos that are being threatened. The idea of individuality brings with it the necessity of some sort of God. A deity is necessary to promote the idea of living in the hereafter. Yet all the signs show we’re just particles of matter – and that’s all that probably does matter. Why don’t we want to probe these phenomena? Our ancestors did. The Shamans did. Why are we so afraid to explore them?’

These questions and many more are raised in _Black Rainbow_ to emotional, chilling and thought-provoking effect. The title was chosen by Hodges for one main reason: ‘The view of the Martha Travis medium and all those people concerned with the hereafter is that life after death is represented by a colourful rainbow. What I’m saying is that it’s about to turn irretrievably black.’

But Hodges has a far more uncanny anecdote about the title as he reveals. ‘Shortly after I had thought of the title I found myself in New York’s Museum of Modern Art. On the top floor there was an exhibition called “Big Graphics”. It was the end of a tiring afternoon and I was leaving when a family passed me and one of the children said, “Look Dad, ‘BLACK RAINBOW’!” I turned around and there behind me was a Jim Dime drawing I had missed. It was titled ‘The Making of BLACK RAINBOW. I knew I had the right title after that coincidence.’

With a budget of $7 million, filming began on _Black Rainbow_ in October 1988 in Charlotte, North Carolina, for a six week period. Hodges says the experience was the best he’s ever had directing a picture. ‘I wouldn’t have missed working with Gerry Fisher (director of photography). He’s such an intelligent man and he gave the movie an incredibly realistic base. Voytek Roman (production designer) is a theatre design genius and his décor was non-intrusive. He gave it the Edward Hopper feel I was after, brought out simply. The day I arrived in Charlotte I saw 250 actors and cast the whole picture, apart from the three leads, in a day and a half. I even recorded the opening and closing music in the six weeks I was there.’

Hodges concludes, ‘The whole film was like a bizarre dream. It was as if it had to be made, like I was on some pre-ordained quest. It sounds daft but it’s the truth. It felt right and the cast and crew loved being involved. I set out to create a world of my own imagination. Ideally one takes an audience by the hand and leads them somewhere they’ve never been before.’
