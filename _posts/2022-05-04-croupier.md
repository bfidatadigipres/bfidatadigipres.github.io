**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

To see _Croupier_ as more writer Paul Mayersberg’s work than director Mike Hodges’ is a powerful temptation. But as _Get Carter_ reminds us (looking on reissue like a cross between _Alfie_, 1966, and _Bande à part_, 1964), Hodges is unfailingly professional in matching style to story. He sets up the context for his players with a discretion verging on anonymity and then, on a whim, takes time out for a striking detail (for example, in 1974’s _The Terminal Man_, the silent invasion of white floor-tiles by bloodied water). Even so, given his special fluency with long shots, the confines of _Croupier_ have cramped Hodges considerably: this is a basement-flat London, briefly glimpsed between forests of mirrors.

Reflections are integral to Mayersberg’s scenario, as might be expected after the emphatic self-regarding theme of his _Eureka_ script. Hodges’ contribution is to fashion the casino as a glass cage of distortions, the eye constantly deceived by misshapen figures and rippled furniture, as unreliable as the occupants. Otherwise, he captures with a merciless accuracy the bedsit decor, the cramped kitchens and sparse sitting rooms, tiny arenas of emotional combat. Even when the scene shifts to a country mansion, the sense of entrapment is maintained, and the camera lingers on a copy of Gericault’s painting _The Raft of the Medusa_ in recognition of a similar predicament: despair, madness and an intolerable intimacy unite the drifting group of the near-dead. Where Hodges and Mayersberg also seem well attuned is in the isolation of their wheel-spinner, a recognisable fusion of the two Jacks – Carter and McCann from _Eureka_ – who fell to earth in their separate ways. The croupier particularly resembles _Eureka_’s lost plutocrat in finding his plot of gold, a best-seller, and freezing into satisfied inaction. In fact, Mayersberg’s reported starting point for _Croupier_ was Kurosawa’s _The Hidden Fortress_ (1958), in which two peasants share a befuddled panic on the edges of a tumultuous history far beyond their comprehension.

In _Get Carter_ the ruthless hitman uncovers a malevolent network for whom his personal vendetta is insignificant. Similarly in _Croupier_ the dealer is not so much crushed as anaesthetised when he learns he’s simply been a card in somebody else’s winning hand all along. His compensation, apart from a slightly dodgy new girlfriend, is the daily opportunity to indulge in the joyful exercise of numbers, a hobby lifted directly from the father-daughter relationship in _Eureka_. His ‘mission’ accomplished, he hails himself master of the game with the power ‘to make you lose’. This dubious accomplishment is neatly celebrated by sweeping the camera (us), along with a pile of gambling chips, down a conclusive black hole.

Part of the intricacy of _Croupier_ (very Mayersbergian) lies in the intermingling of ‘fiction’ and ‘reality’, portions of the story being disguised as the croupier’s novel. Since all the characters are living their own fictions anyway, the flatly rendered dialogue, spoken as if quoting a text, adds to the sense of a writer shuffling phrases and episodes until he finds the most suitable. At one point the on-screen Jack even corrects the off-screen Jake, who has been chipping in throughout the film with information and opinion. Such ironies aside, and despite earnest performances by all concerned, _Croupier_ is an absorbing rather than an appealing exercise. As the croupier’s partner observes on first reading: ‘There’s no hope in it.’ But the misanthropist is dismissive: ‘It’s the truth,’ he says.<br>
**Philip Strick, _Sight & Sound_, July 1999**<br>

Paul Mayersberg: ‘The origin of the ﬁlm is a curious one. I had for many years tried to write a ﬁlm about a gambler who plans a raid on a casino, but on the night of the robbery, he breaks the bank himself and so there is no money to steal. I could never quite make it work as the story was an anti-climax. I decided to look at it from another angle – to tell a story where fate intervenes to ruin the plans but good comes of it. If you gamble, you are aware of winning and losing streaks. I wanted to write a story where the two came together. In the original there was a character who never spoke, he was just an observer – the croupier. I decided to tell his story. I switched everything around and the croupier became the hero, the minor character became central and the gambler disappeared.

‘I was inspired by Kurosawa’s samurai story _The Hidden Fortress_, in which the lead characters are hangers-on. In Japan, many attitudes are the complete reversal of the European. I took what I thought was a Japanese view of the story. I just kept the essence of the original ironic tale.’

Jonathan Cavendish of Little Bird was approached by Channel Four’s David Aukin to produce the ﬁlm: ‘The script immediately appealed to me. It is a very modern story with contemporary ideas, but told in a very classic manner. The ﬁrst task was to ﬁnd the right director. Both David and Paul had known Mike Hodges for years and I am a great fan of many of his ﬁlms.

‘The three of us all wanted to work with him, which was a happy coincidence. Mike is very good on atmosphere. The script was very intense and had a compelling quality which draws you into the story and Mike is able to do the same cinematically. I think all Mike’s ﬁlms have a theme: an individual within or against the system; but in this case, the individual realises where he belongs.’

Much of Mike Hodges’ early documentary work for _World in Action_ depended on observing life within organisations from Mobil Oil to the US presidential elections. He explains the project’s appeal: ‘The story seemed relevant to the times we live in and had a complicated psychology. I was intrigued by the role of the croupier. It sounds like a romantic job and conjures up thoughts and images, but in fact it’s a very curious job. It’s not very well paid and croupiers have an ambivalent relationship with both the people who run the casino (and make vast sums of money), and the punters – the people who spend the money.

‘The casino becomes a metaphor for life and Jack is like a scientist observing human behaviour close-up. I have that in common with the character – as I watch people’s behaviour very acutely. The casino struck me as a bell jar where it’s possible to examine human frailty and foolishness and to either sympathise with it or to despise it. Jack treads a ﬁne line between the two.’

Clive Owen was cast as the central character, Jack Manfred. ‘Clive is extraordinary, he’s the most precise actor I’ve worked with since Michael Caine. He also has an extensive knowledge of ﬁlmmaking and its rhythms. I think he is ideally cast,’ says Hodges.

Owen explains what attracted him to the part: ‘I liked the emotional world underneath the surface of the script, which is not immediately apparent. It’s very economically written with quite a simple story line, the casino is an analogy for something bigger. The voiceover is the ﬁlm for me. Without that it would be too elusive. Jack has a conversation with the audience throughout. Part of my decision was also Mike’s involvement; he’s a joy to work with, he’s very experienced which is very important when you’re making such a complex ﬁlm.

Paul Mayersberg researched the subject by talking to croupiers to get the correct procedure: ‘A lot of the detail of the ﬁlm has been supervised by experts in different departments. The psychology came from talking to croupiers. The most important aspect seemed to be how tedious the job is. The people who do it are attracted initially by the possibility of promotion and travel, but the price you pay is to be psychologically undermined. It’s just like boarding school with its hierarchy, prefects and rules.

‘I am resolutely not a gambler. It’s seductive and undermines your life. I was interested to look at gambling from the point of view of a man who can’t lose. He has contempt for gamblers and his kick is watching them lose. As a croupier, Jack’s not typical because he refuses to gamble. His gamble is the writing connection. Writers all believe that, against the odds, they are going to be published and successful.’

Mayersberg explains why the ﬁlm is relevant to all of us: ‘The world of the casino is divided into gamblers and croupiers. The gamblers take risks and the croupiers have no risk at all; the odds are always in favour of the casino. We have a choice in life between working in the casino or the risk-taking of being a gambler. The question arises: do you want a life of security or a life of risk? The answer is: we want both.’<br>
