**Satoshi Kon and screenwriter Sadayuki Murai on ‘Millennium Actress’**

_Who is Chiyoko and how did you come up with this idea that the heroine’s desperately determined wish makes her transcend time and space? Is there an actual actress who inspired you to write this story?_

Kon: It was not something I had thought about for a long time. I came up with this story when we reached the planning phase for the film. I didn’t have the image of the heroine with a desperately determined wish from the beginning.  I just wanted to make a movie like a _trompe l’oeil_. Then I realised that the concept of an actress fit this project perfectly. A heroine with a desperately determined wish became necessary to consummate the episodes with the consistency to be intricately entangled.

There is no specific actress as the foundation of Chiyoko; however, Setsuko Hara is somewhat similar to this concept as an actress who abruptly retires and disappears from the screen. I also had the image of Hideko Takamine, who had offered bright hopes to the nation in post-war Japan.

_The film changes from present day to different historical periods such as the Edo Period and the Meiji Period, even going far back to the Warring States period. Did this create a challenge for you?_

Kon: Most modern Japanese have specific images of the Edo Period, which are not necessarily the actual Edo Period. Television and movies have created those particular images. For instance, when Akoh Roushi, a group of 47 samurais staged a revenge attack for their lord in January 1703, it was a requisite that the scene be snowy, regardless of historical verification. What we included is our image of history. I wanted Chiyoko to run through such images. Historical accuracy doesn’t really matter in this case.

We created this film with our own vision of Japanese history. Obviously, I was very careful in the scenes where historical events took place. Otherwise, we might end up exposing our ignorance of history to the public. The most challenging part was determining which historical periods and scenes to adopt for the film. We repeatedly had discussions before reaching the final decision on the screenplay.

Murai: We adopted many historical events which were interpreted into movies. The reason why we adopted Manchuria in the film is not simply because movies about Manchuria were produced back then, but, also, we wanted to express how vibrant the cinema industry was even during the gloomy  pre-war days.

Kon: Chiyoko is an innocent girl whose first love is the most important thing to her despite the fact that Japan was in a politically sensitive time of rightwing bias in those days. Chiyoko never loses her innocence even after she gets older. Yet she matures. Since the length of this film is limited, I couldn’t take time to describe the process of her maturity from a girl to a woman, so I attempted to express it with symbols.

For example, Snow White had a coffin made of glass; Rapunzel was confined to a tower and rescued; Chiyoko is confined to a jail and then escapes.  This image is of death and rebirth. Chiyoko is held responsible for being a member of society after escaping from the jail. In terms of a fairy tale or old folk tale, I had an image of Kaguya Hime (Princess Moon), who travels far beyond the moon.

_It seems that numerous images overlap. Describe how you used images to underscore the symbolic messages in Millennium Actress._

Kon: We consider rubble as very significant in terms of symbolic expression. The film studio turns into rubble, and this symbolises old Chiyoko. There are piles of rubble from the Great Tokyo Earthquake when Chiyoko was born.  The town is filled with rubble in the post-war, and then rubble from the studio appears again at the end of the film. Rubble is a symbol expressing death and rebirth or something like that. I didn’t clearly intend it from the beginning. I was not aware of seeking it. While I was drawing the storyboard to embody such images, I realised, ‘Oh, I just drew rubble again, I see that’s what it means.’

This way, I discovered the meaning of the symbols and developed the story while drawing them. This applies to the action of running. At the beginning, a body movement called running is done simply by two legs. As time elapses, the movement shifts to a horse, a bicycle, a car, a train, a boat and a rocket. This is also the history of modern Western science. However, her ultimate destination is somewhere she cannot reach with the help of modern science. The first rocket you see is a symbol of science, but the one that appears at the end of is not. The audience can enjoy it more this way. We have incorporated different layers of events in the film apart from the superficial story. So, I want each audience to find its own viewpoint on this film.

_This is your first original film based on your original story. How challenging  was it?_

Kon: I didn’t find the process of creating the story and drawings particularly difficult just because it was my original. But it seemed challenging to be accepted. Everyone in the industry responded very low-key without exception when they heard the story of Chiyoko. After its completion, I heard such comments as ‘it has the true essence of animation,’ and ‘its free-spirited ideas are pleasant.’ No one says it’s extravagant. Since everyone kept asking me, ‘why are you making a film which is not even close to animation?’ I had this perverse idea that I don’t like something if I feel it is like animation’. The response to this film is very encouraging. I feel somewhat like, ‘See, I did it!’
