An island off the coast of Georgia, 1902: a Gullah family is gathered for a last supper before the younger generation leave for the mainland, leaving behind the matriarch Nana and the traditions of their African ancestors. Impressionistic, imaginative and steeped in symbols, myth and history, Dash’s time-bending film combines and contrasts different belief systems to highly original effect.<br>

As a sequel to Julie Dash’s _Daughters of the Dust_ was never made, we never knew what became of the Peazant girls after they crossed over to the mainland from the Sea Islands of South Carolina. That is, until Beyoncé’s visual album _Lemonade_ dropped in 2016 and seemed to pick up the story of its gorgeously garbed black women as they struggled to find their way in the New World. Thanks to _Lemonade’s_ distinct homage, Dash’s pioneering movie was rediscovered by a new generation and has now been restored and rereleased in time for its 25th anniversary.

There is something wonderfully apposite about this binding together of eras, given that _Daughters of the Dust_ is itself a contemplation of time’s circularity. The overlaying of past, present and future is the framing device for the film, which offers a rare insight into African women’s spirituality shared across lineages and throughout the diaspora. At a moment when third-wave feminism meets pop culture meets a refreshed black identity politics, _Daughters of the Dust_ remains a futuristic glimpse into the past.

The film is set at the turn of the 20th century among the isolated Gullah community inhabiting the islands off the coast of South Carolina. The descendants of West African slaves, they lived in relative paradise away from the Jim Crow South, speaking their Yoruba-influenced dialect and practising their customs freely.

The tight community is threatened when the sophisticated Yellow Mary, played by Dash favourite Barbara-O, returns from the mainland to take the family with her. Grandmother Nana Peazant represents the past. Her ancient rituals shape the film’s sensual poetry. The present resides in her offspring who, in various states of excitement and anxiety, prepare to leave. The future is embodied in the voice of an unborn child who narrates the last few days in the coastal idyll, highlighting the tension between what once was and what is to come. ‘How you can leave this soil?’ laments Nana Peazant. Watching today, as the #BlackLivesMatter refrain echoes across America’s northern states, we find ourselves lamenting with her.

The marriage between director and material in _Daughters of the Dust_ feels near perfect. Not only is Dash herself a descendant of the relatively small crop of Gullah people, she is also a child of the LA Rebellion, a school of pan-Africanist filmmakers based at UCLA in the 1970s, who took inspiration from post-colonial cinematic movements in Latin America and beyond as well as European neorealism. However, it was her one-time relationship with cinematographer Arthur Jafa, and with production designer Kerry James Marshall (now an internationally renowned painter), that creates the extraordinary feel of the film: the sumptuousness of the costumes, the locations peopled by beautiful black actors, redefine the turn-of-the-century period film. Here the pale blush of Edith Wharton’s heroines become the rich tonal hues of actresses Cora Lee Day, Alva Rogers and Adisa Anderson.

_Daughters of the Dust_ took more than ten years to make, having begun as a silent short. The script was rejected by most, but PBS American Playhouse finally stumped up the relatively small $800,000 budget. Particular attention was paid to the verisimilitude of the design. The film was shot on location in the Sea Islands and only materials that the Gullah would have had access to at the time were used, including the hand-dyed indigo and white cotton of the women’s dresses.

In 1992, _Daughters of the Dust_ became the first feature by an African-American woman to be theatrically distributed – helped by another black woman, promoter Michelle Materre of KJM3 Entertainment Group. Materre borrowed pioneer filmmaker Oscar Micheaux’s distribution techniques and spread the word through black churches and communities.

Like Beyoncé’s _Lemonade_ today, _Daughters of the Dust_ became symbolic of the alternative aesthetic that black female artists had been forging for years, an aesthetic that merged fact with metaphor, the physical with the metaphysical. While Hollywood was still treating black woman as mulattoes, mammies or maids, Dash had already made three seminal shorts – _Four Women_ (1975), _Diary of an African Nun_ (1977) and _Illusions_ (1982) – and filmmakers such as Kathleen Collins _(Losing Ground,_ 1982) and Camille Billops _(Finding Christa,_ 1991) had crafted intimate, subjective features based on their experiences as complex artists.

Despite its critical and box-office success, another feature along the lines of _Daughters of the Dust_ never came. Instead Dash continued her trajectory predominantly on the small screen. She made a number of TV movies over the next ten years, including one about civil rights activist Rosa Parks, and worked with leading actresses such as Angela Bassett, Alfre Woodard, Loretta Devine and C.C.H. Pounder.

Twenty-five years on, _Daughters of the Dust_ still feels remarkable. Its rich cinematic language breaks open formal storytelling, allowing a distinct, possibly ancient, voice to emerge that changes the possibilities of cinema for black female filmmakers and viewers.<br>
