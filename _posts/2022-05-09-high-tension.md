**The films of the New French Extremity and the accompanying focus on Gaspar Noé examine an important, controversial and highly violent cinema movement. They are not suitable for all.**

**The film you are about to watch may contain very dark themes, graphic imagery, and scenes of a very upsetting nature including sexual violence and body horror.**

**A contemporary review**  
Like the spectre of Michael Myers, repeatedly declared dead only to return again from the grave, 1970s-inflected horror movies just won’t lie down and die. Already in the past 12 months we’ve seen high-octane remakes of George Romero’s _Dawn of the Dead_ and Tobe Hooper’s _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_. In the coming months the notoriously ‘nasty’ thrills of _The Toolbox Murders_ will be revisited once again, with Hooper taking over the DIY-death honours from original director Dennis Donnelly. Meanwhile from France comes _High Tension_, a riotous slasher throwback which writer-director Alexandre Aja describes as an attempt to return to ‘the roots of the genre, to give the audience a real “battle for survival”.’

‘I’ll never let anyone come between us again,’ promises heroine Marie at the beginning and end of this ferocious nightmare in which two young women go head-to-head with a relentless monster hell-bent on painting their world blood red. It’s a promise she is determined to keep, even if honouring it means letting her repressed animal instincts off the leash. In a remote woodland farmhouse (‘It’s like a doll’s house...’) Marie and the family of her best friend Alex are besieged by an implacable killer who wields a cut-throat razor and a growling wood-saw with equal panache. Blood-spurting decapitations, wince-making eviscerations and hefty axings ensue as the killer runs (or more accurately plods) amok, taking the wild and worldly Alex captive and leaving the apparently chaste tomboy Marie to save the day. ‘The other girls were alone,’ insists Marie, who has been haunted by dreams of pursuing herself through darkened woods. ‘There are two of us – we’ll be OK.’ But will Marie become a generic ‘final girl’ and triumph over adversity in the style of Halloween’s Laurie Strode? Or will the spectacularly slimy killer, a portly sixtysomething man in greasy grey overalls who drives a beat-up van, chew her up and spit her out with scant regard for generic convention?

Filmed with an edgy stylishness that belies the tight six-week shoot, Aja’s  rip-roaring romp certainly gives horror fans more than their money’s worth, terrorising (rather than patronising) those in search of a damn good scare.  Over the course of its stripped-down running time we are witness to a series of gruelling encounters played out against a splendidly abstract soundtrack packed with guttural moans, unworldly booms and insistent electrical hisses. While chirpy pop songs and innocuous mall music waft ironically over the airwaves (‘You’re just another girl,’ warns one song, ‘maybe nice, but not that smart...’), the ambient sound of _High Tension_ creaks away like a rusty gate in hell, cranking up the knuckle-chewing tension and reminding us just what an inventively dangerous weapon the slasher genre can be when placed in disreputable hands.

Eschewing the knowing nods and winks of the postmodern slasher-cinema revival (_Scream_, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, et al), Aja and co-writer Grégory Levasseur play their killer hand commendably straight even as the numerous generic references tempt them to crack a stylistic smile. Early scenes of Marie and Alex heading off towards predictable peril in a woodland retreat chime with a string of rape-revenge shockers from Wes Craven’s _Last House on the Left_ (1972) to Meir Zarchi’s _Day of the Woman_/_I Spit on Your Grave_ (1978). Shades of _The Evil Dead_ (1982) haunt the night-time exteriors of the farmhouse (prowled from ominously low angles and silhouetted against glowing moons and cloudy skies), while inside the sight of blood spraying theatrically on to bright-white walls recalls the _giallo_ excesses of Dario Argento. Meanwhile a revolting early gag about oral sex and decapitated heads (‘Look me in the eye...’) confirms the filmmakers’ willingness to resort to outright repugnance, nodding their heads towards a string of gore classics from Bill Lustig’s _Maniac_ (1980) to Stuart Gordon’s _Re-animator_ (1985) and leaving us enticingly uneasy about just how far they’ll go in their desire to shock.

To this end Aja is ably assisted by the monolithic presence of Philippe Nahon, who brings the heavyweight baggage of his vile _Seul contre tous_ persona to bear on what is essentially an off-the-peg psycho-slasher villain. While his filthy overalls and shambling heavy-shoed gait recall the Michaels and Jasons of endless _Halloween_ and _Friday the 13th_ sequels, Nahon’s methodically grisly dispatching of Alex’s family owes more to the spectre of Leatherface from  _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_, and a sequence in which he takes a powertool to a car with intestine-ripping results seems a direct homage to the only memorable scene from _TCM 2_.

Maïwenn and Cécile de France do sterling work as Alex and Marie, the latter a particular revelation for anyone who caught her amiably ditzy turn in the recent Jackie Chan remake of _Around the World in 80 Days_. Unrecognisable from her more mainstream incarnation, de France dominates the screen as the crop-haired heroine who proves more than a match for her marauding male nemesis. It’s a terrifically physical performance and a sinewy portrait of raw survival instinct that provides an easy point of identification for audience members of either sex – reminding us once again that the purest pleasures of slasher cinema are not sadistic but masochistic, focusing our attention on the trials (and eventual triumph?) of the victim rather than the actions of the aggressor. Unlike many of its predecessors, _High Tension_ sidesteps the leery visual sexism that made some 1970s slashers such a boy’s-own affair. Although Nahon’s killer is earmarked early on as a necrophile rapist, his on-screen attacks provoke none of the bare-breasted titillation for which the genre became infamous. Instead, these grisly assaults are heard rather than seen, the sound of Nahon’s animal grunting mixing with the shrieks of his victims in a manner that’s terrifying rather than titillating.

Like last year’s equally straight-faced _Cabin Fever_ (which also demonstrated the benefits of not playing these throwback thrills ironically), _High Tension_ inhabits a world of nightmare cinema that seems to have been conjured entirely from the fond adolescent memories of its unabashed-fan creators. As the tagline for _Last House on the Left_ told us all those years ago, in the end, ‘keep telling yourself: it’s only a movie, only a movie...’
