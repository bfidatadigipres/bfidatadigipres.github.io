Terence Davies wrote in the introduction to the published script for _Distant Voices Still Lives_ that he was ‘trying to create ‘a pattern of timeless moments’.’ Yet that picture has stronger dramatic line than _The Long Day Closes_. In _Distant Voices_ family life eddies around an immovable rock: the father’s violence to the mother and their children. He has furies, never explained. At Christmas, sat down to dinner, he suddenly pulls the cloth off the table and roars at his wife to clean up. A man can die eventually, but that sort of timeless moment lingers.

_The Long Day Closes_ has violence only at school. There’s a cane in every room, ready to come down on the palm of a hand. Mr Nicholls – who teaches erosion – uses his cane to show the boys who’s boss: ‘You play ball with me, I’ll play ball with you.’ And the hands take the cane’s slap and grow harder, or less hurt, their owners more certain they can hold back the tears. A skin grows, a new surface – or is the hand beaten away, as in the larger world, according to Mr Nicholls, where erosion does its remorseless natural work? In all of Davies’ films there are processes that wear life away and those that let it grow new resources. The school has very limited functions: it canes, it permits bullying, it teaches erosion and it does the ceaseless missionary work of testing the boys’ hair for lice.

After all, this is Liverpool, as 1955 turns into 1956 – and people are a few years away yet from being told they’d never had it so good. The family members wash their hair over a basin using saucepans of hot water and cold; there doesn’t seem to be much variety in the way of food. And there’s no television yet – when that comes, does it add or take away from the easy-going, sing-song atmosphere? There’s just radio and a shilling if Bud wants to go to the pictures.

‘Mam,’ he asks, ‘can I go to the pictures?… I’ve got a penny… If you gave me eleven-pence I’d have a shilling.’ Which is a working definition of mother love and the new version of hard times. And you can tell from Bud’s wheedling voice that he fancies he’s going to get the eleven-pence. He’s done it before. And then he’s standing outside the Hippodrome and Doris Day is singing ‘At Sundown’ from _Love Me or Leave Me_. It would have been an A certificate, so Bud has to ask strangers to take him in. We all did it then, and our mothers knew and went along with it. How old is Bud? About 11? So I wonder what he made of _Love Me or Leave Me_. Not that the ladies or gentlemen who took strange kids in to see A-certificate films often tested one afterwards. There were a couple of old ladies in Streatham who would take me from the Astoria, over the High Road, to Pratt’s, to the restaurant there. They would insist that I had an icecream and ask: ‘Did you enjoy the picture, dear?’

I love _The Long Day Closes_ far too much to start any serious consideration of its director ‘cheating’, but I have to say I think Terence Davies is having his cake and eating it. Because, if you recall, he does suggest that Bud has been seeing _Love Me or Leave Me_ (1955) and _The Ladykillers_ (1955) and _The Robe_ (1953 – though it’s a very tattered, eroded poster on the street wall). I will even allow him the song from _Tammy_ (which is 1957). That’s not my real issue. The thing I love in _The Long Day Closes_, but have to complain about, is that Bud seems also to have seen _Meet Me in St. Louis_ (1944) and _The Magnificent Ambersons_ (1942). Bet you didn’t! Bet I did!

Of course, it is the scholar and the nostalgist summoning up memories of those films for an 11-year-old in Liverpool. There wasn’t the chance then to see old pictures in re-runs – not even hits like _Meet Me in St. Louis_, let alone the devastating failure of _The Magnificent Ambersons_. And how could Bud be expected to understand a young man’s ‘come-uppance’ when Orson’s dark, dreamy voice tells what happened to George Minafer? Is these films’ inclusion legitimate? Yes, because those two extras are near enough in time to be incorporated, and because they enjoy the same rapturous sense of movie palaces where crowds reclined in such hallowed story sense beneath the funnels of projected light where Beowulfs of cigarette smoke wrestled. (Just to show you that anyone can do 11 going on 21!)

But the employment of ‘wrong’ period films does alert us to this obvious and crucial thing: that _The Long Day Closes_ is not actually ‘There is a boy’, but ‘There was a boy’, which is already tinged with the mixed feelings of adulthood. And that’s where those two extra movies are so suggestive. I can believe that putting his film together (for £1.75 million, for the British Film Institute and Channel 4), Davies took clips where he could get them and afford them. It may be that those two movies are there from forced measure, or chance.

Still, they say so much about family. _Meet Me in St. Louis_, if you recall, is a version of ‘our family is perfect’. And if I recall _Ambersons_, it’s a heartfelt, rueful story about an imperfect but agreeable family that falls apart. They are the Ambersons and they once gave the best parties in that part of Indiana. But the family flopped. Some of them died. Georgie – the bright young hope – has to eat ashes. And if we’d had the whole film that Welles intended, then we’d have seen Georgie and Fanny living in a low boarding house, wondering if they’ll ever recover.

I have to say that Terence Davies’ family films don’t quite face that alteration in family life. There is tragedy in the violence of _Distant Voices_ and a kind of reward in the unmarred love of mother and son in _The Long Day Closes_. The aural quilt of the latter is easier in that there are raised voices, no rows. But I wonder in real life how long it was before, say, Terence started going out with a Protestant girl… or a black boy. There’s a wondrous moment in the film when a man from Jamaica amiable in every way – comes looking for someone. And the white family jump as if he were a ghost. In the next few years colour came to Britain and many unexpected adjustments were required. The autobiographical films Davies made – though they are more and less than that – are one of our treasures. But in certain dramatic and sociological ways they stop at a point where life might become harder, and where an angelic mother might open her eyes wide and say ‘What?’ (like comedian Ted Ray at some outrage) if Bud brought Sal Mineo home, or Monty Clift.<br>
