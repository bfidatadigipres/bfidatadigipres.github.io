**The films of the New French Extremity and the accompanying focus on Gaspar Noé examine an important, controversial and highly violent cinema movement. They are not suitable for all.**

**The film you are about to watch may contain very dark themes, graphic imagery, and scenes of a very upsetting nature including sexual violence and body horror.**

One of the most divisive French films of recent times, _Martyrs_ is shocking in its unrelenting examination of pain and transcendence. It follows two young women, Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï) and Anna (Morjana Alaoui), as the former plots revenge against a group who tortured her for a year in an abandoned abattoir.

A vital film in the so called New French Extremity, it pushed the boundaries of on-screen violence, taking inspiration from both the writings of Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade and the wave of American ‘torture porn’ movies such as the _Saw_ franchise.  
**Adam Scovell, bfi.org.uk, 31 October 2018**

_Martyrs_, the second feature from _House of Voices_ director Pascal Laugier, is a pulverising journey into pain built on astoundingly committed performances by Mylène Jampanoï and Morjana Alaoui. Embracing and then transcending the torture obsession of films such as _Saw_ and _Hostel_ (both of which, despite the bolt-cutters and popped eyeballs, are essentially ‘goodtime’ thrill-rides), Laugier’s story ricochets somewhere altogether stranger, with scenes of gruelling physical horror, stomach-churning emotional anguish, and a truly bizarre strain of religious villainy. The first part of the film, depicting the shocking revenge a woman, Lucie, exacts on those she believes abused her as a child, pushes physical violence to extremes. Laugier makes things queasier by skilfully feeding our doubts: by the time we understand the truth of what we’ve seen, events have spiralled so far out of control that we dread what still remains and, with another 30 minutes of brutality to go, many will find themselves glancing nervously at their watches.

Scenes of drawn-out torture subdue the more whimsical amusements of horror, closing down narrative pleasure and blocking aesthetic escape routes. They can induce either morbid vertigo, a sensation of confronting our worst fears – or boredom, depending on the quality of the film and the emotional engagement of the viewer. Most horror films fixate on the body these days, but _Martyrs_ is equally concerned with the suffering of the mind trapped in the bleeding flesh. It’s a frequently sad, sombre film, thanks to a script that explores issues of trust, loyalty, betrayal, guilt and self-harm. As a child, Lucie escaped abuse while leaving a fellow captive behind, giving rise to corrosive guilt and razor-slashing ‘visitations’ from an emaciated ghoul, while her friend Anna’s doubts about Lucie’s sanity and ability to identify her abusers likewise lead to agonising emotional consequences.

The subject of confinement and torture echoes several recent real-life atrocities (Marc Dutroux, Josef Fritzl and, with its religious extremism, the Mauerova family/‘Grail Movement’ case) but the overall sobriety of the film avoids sensationalism. Which is just as well: whereas European horrors such as the French _Frontière(s)_ and the Belgian _Calvaire_ have visited extreme violence chiefly on male characters, _Martyrs_ takes the ‘old-school’ route and places only female characters in jeopardy. It does so, however, in a resolutely unexploitative way; sexual abuse is not involved, and the camera observes events without the teasing prurience common in the genre.

Viewers accustomed to gore but allergic to Christian symbolism may find that it’s the film’s underlying themes, rather than the sadism, which bring them out in a rash. The Eastern Orthodox notion of martyrdom sees it as ‘baptism in blood’, of a higher order than mere baptism in water, and this gives an otherwise puzzling scene in which Anna is sponged down with cold water a sense of ritual preparation for what must follow. Anna’s tragic need for expiation eventually leads to an astonishing sequence, redolent of Gaspar Noé’s _Irréversible_ (2002) though philosophically more aligned with Ken Russell’s _Altered States_ (1980), which strives to visualise a metaphysical state onscreen. And for those who regard the idea of transfiguration as just so much mumbo-jumbo, the film’s provocative climax allows for a highly satisfying existential reading too.

_Martyrs_ feels closer to Japanese or Italian horror than to the _Hostel_/_Saw_ axis, and the frenzied performance of Jampanoï frequently recalls Isabelle Adjani in that most convulsive of Euro art-horrors, Andrzej Zulawski’s _Possession_ (1981). It’s perhaps inevitable, given the flesh-ripping religiosity of the climax, that Laugier has been signed up to direct the remake of Clive Barker’s _Hellraiser_, but meanwhile, with this immensely confident, arresting and stylish film, he has restated Europe’s claim to the edgiest of horror cinema.<br>**Stephen Thrower, _Sight & Sound_, May 2009**
