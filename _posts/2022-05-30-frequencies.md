_+ intro and discussion._

This enigmatic sci-fi is set in an alternative reality where frequencies emitted by the human brain determine future outcomes. The very existence of free will is questioned as a handful of young people gradually realise that difference is a strength to be harnessed, rather than a weakness to be concealed.

_Frequencies_ is the opening feature in a series of three screenings in this strand (next ones in June and July) exploring difference and the sensory effects that nature, with its abundance of ambient sights and sounds, can have upon both body and mind.

Please join us for an informal discussion in the Blue Room after the screening.<br>

‘Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.’  Marie Curie (1867-1934)

Marie-Curie happens to be the name of a central character in _Frequencies_, the opening feature in a three-film series exploring difference and the sensory effects the ambient sights and sounds of nature can have upon both body and mind.

Throughout the series sound is made tactile, something to be touched and felt, through expressive, multi-layered sound design and sonorous soundscapes humming with the low-bass frequencies and rhythmical droning of today’s hyper-stimulated world.
