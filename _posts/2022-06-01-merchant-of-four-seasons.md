**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Fassbinder was influenced by a range of aesthetic practices, but this chronicle of the downward spiral of a would-be-engineer-turned-fruitseller casually neglected by family, friends and society is as astute, unsentimental and affecting as _Mouchette_. Fassbinder’s conversion to the cause of melodrama was still recent, and the florid flourishes here are still counterbalanced by a minimalist focus on essentials.

_Der Händler der vier Jahreszeiten_ – the title is a literal translation of the French ‘_marchand des quatre saisons_’, which sounds as odd in German as it does in English – marked a turning-point in Fassbinder’s film practice, and was the first of his films to achieve widespread recognition and acclaim in Germany; it represented a new beginning after the group introspection and self-criticism of _Beware of a Holy Whore_ the year before. Briefly, the collapse of Fassbinder’s Antitheatre ideal of ensemble creation led him to a reassessment of his political role as a filmmaker, and to a revision of his ideas on film form and stylisation; _Merchant_ was the first result, paving the way for the subsequent TV ‘soap opera’ _8 Hours Are Not a Day_ and the movie _Fear Eats the Soul_.

The most striking difference between this and earlier Fassbinder movies is the immense gain in simplicity and clarity, qualities about which there is nothing deceptive. As the chronicle of a man whose dreams and aspirations are systematically denied him by his petit bourgeois environment, _Merchant_ could hardly be more straightforward: its linear narrative (as schematic as the pattern of rejections and exploitations in _Fear_) is a step-by-loaded-step catalogue of the betrayals and humiliations that Hans suffers, while occasional fragmentary, dream-like flashbacks serve to expose the roots of his oppression. The other main change is the nature of the _mise en scène_; the Godardian unpredictability and genre permutations of the earlier films are replaced by a kind of hyper-naturalism, still very stylised in its deployment of the actors and locations and in its use of dialogue, but absolutely keyed to mundane realities. Fassbinder himself calls this a search for a true ‘naïveté’, by which he evidently means as ingenuous as possible a presentation of his themes; it could perhaps more helpfully be described as a ‘primitive’ style, in the sense that the word is used to characterise a Douanier Rousseau painting or a vintage Sam Fuller movie.

The fascinating tension between this wish for a ‘transparency’ of style and the formal innovations intrinsic to the process of realising it – a tension that later forms the very substance of movies like _Martha_ and _Effi Briest_ – is here kept very much in check. _Merchant_ consequently achieves an extraordinary reading of ‘ordinary’ events, and does so with apparently effortless ease; the fact that it was shot in only 11 days suggests both the strength of the method and Fassbinder’s confidence in it. The film’s theme is double-edged. The sympathetic portrayal of Hans’ suffering is intensified by the character’s own inarticulateness; Fassbinder takes pleasure in speaking ‘for’ a man incapable of doing so himself, just as Petra von Kant’s theatrical outpourings of grief spell out emotional responses that are commonly repressed or understated. At the same time, though, Hans’ eminently understandable withdrawal into resentful silence tends to redirect attention the more strongly on to the other characters, whose actions and attitudes caused his plight, and as it proceeds the film develops an extremely thorough-going critique of petit bourgeois society in terms much less equivocal than, say, Chabrol’s.

Fassbinder sharpens his critique by locating it historically; although he’s not shy of the odd anachronism, it is clear from the clothes and many of the props that the action occurs in the Fifties, and it is no accident that several of the character names – Epp, the lawyer von Schirach – will carry Nazi associations for a German viewer. The ending, with Harry stepping into Hans’ shoes ‘for the sake of the child’ and thus perpetuating the social cycle that brought Hans down, carries the full charge of Fassbinder’s venom, its provocativeness springing from its very bleakness. It should be noted that the inexorable quality of the exposition is sometimes blackly humorous in the manner of later Fassbinder, without in any way compromising the director’s commitment to his stance. Although seen here after several of the films that it led to, _Merchant of Four Seasons_ stands up strongly as an all-but-exemplary product of Fassbinder’s theory of political film. And although it evidences a much greater authorial control than many of its predecessors, a major factor contributing to its success is the admirably unified ensemble playing.
