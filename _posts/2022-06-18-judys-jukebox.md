To celebrate 100 years of the brilliant Judy Garland, we present a jukebox night playing clips of some of the best-known hits from her career. Our guest host Caroline George will lead you through songs like _Meet Me in St. Louis’_ ‘The Trolley Song’, _Summer_ _Stock_’s infectiously joyful ‘Get Happy’, and of course Judy’s signature track – the Academy Award-winning ‘Over the Rainbow’. Singing along is essential and dressing up is strongly encouraged!

**Caroline George** has been singing professionally for over 20 years. She is a brilliant performer and comedienne with lots of flair and has a vast knowledge of songs from all eras. As a teenager she toured Poland with a local Jazz Band and has never stopped singing since. She adores Judy Garland and was brought up on her music from her parents. Caroline also plays piano and has taken up bass guitar in the lockdown. She loves singing jazz and swing but overall she loves encouraging her audiences to join in and sing along.
