_+ intro and discussion._

Exploring the words of Lao Tzu, ‘silence is a source of great strength’, this documentary encourages us to really observe the world around us.

This contemplative, richly sensory documentary is about humankind’s millennia-long fascination with silence and its supposed healing properties for both body and mind. Shifting in time and space, the film shows that true silence has long been pursued yet remains just beyond our grasp.

Please join us for an informal discussion in the Blue Room after the screening.<br>

**NATURAL CONNECTIONS**<br>

**A three-film series curated by Benjamin Brown, founder of Citizen Autistic.**<br>

‘Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.’  Marie Curie (1867-1934)

Marie-Curie happens to be the name of a central character in _Frequencies_, the opening feature in a three-film series exploring difference and the sensory effects the ambient sights and sounds of nature can have upon both body and mind.

Throughout the series sound is made tactile, something to be touched and felt, through expressive, multi-layered sound design and sonorous soundscapes humming with the low-bass frequencies and rhythmical droning of today’s hyper-stimulated world.
