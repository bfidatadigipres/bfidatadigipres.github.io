When _Women in Love_ opened theatrically in Britain in the autumn of 1969, its director, Ken Russell, had been a professional filmmaker for a full decade. Although he had only made two cinema features, he had also made over 30 BBC productions, graduating from brief fillers for the _Monitor_ arts magazine programme (1959-63) to feature-length 35mm productions, including  _The Debussy Film_ (1965), _Dante’s Inferno_ (1967) and _Song of Summer_ (1968), the first two of which starred Oliver Reed. Whereas the cinema films had been circumscribed by budget restrictions and an unfinished script (1963’s _French Dressing_) or the dictates of the spy-film genre and a very hands-on producer (1967’s _Billion Dollar Brain_), the later BBC films were made with far greater freedom, and _Women in Love_ was the first time that this unfettered creative licence spilled over onto the big screen.

It was a very ambitious project to take on: although Russell had adapted novels in the past, they were lighter fare like George and Weedon Grossmith’s _Diary of a Nobody_ (filmed for the BBC in 1964) or the Len Deighton source for _Billion Dollar Brain_. By contrast, D.H. Lawrence’s _Women in Love_ was one of the major British literary masterpieces of the 20th century, its psychologically dense pages defying easy translation. Quoted in John Baxter’s biography  _An Appalling Talent_, Russell himself acknowledged that: ‘It’s impossible to film a 600-page novel and be true to the author’s vision. Two hours is about all anyone can take at a sitting. Many great scenes had to be sacrificed. I particularly regret the omission of the Brangwen girls’ sojourn in London where they sample _la vie bohème_. It helped form their characters and explains their subsequent behaviour.’

Although he later made it clear that he was unimpressed with certain aspects of the novel: ‘A lot of the book seemed pretentious and repetitive, and I left a lot of it out because films lasting 24 hours are frowned on by distributors and partly, as I say, because Lawrence simply repeated his theme about the separate-yet-united philosophy of love eight times over in different guises.  I thought twice would be enough in the film for most people to get it.’

But much of it struck a resonant chord. In particular, the early scene in which Rupert Birkin (Alan Bates) deliberately subverts the self-consciously affected Russian-influenced ‘entertainment’ devised by Hermione Roddice (Eleanor Bron) includes a passage that, while sourced from the novel, might as well have been Russell’s own personal credo: ‘It was an act of pure spontaneity. You can’t bear anything to be spontaneous, can you? Because then it’s no longer in your power. You must clutch things and have them in your power. And why? Because you haven’t got any real body, any dark, sensual body  of life.’

Russell dedicated his entire creative life to discovering and unveiling that dark, sensual body of life. Indeed, an even earlier exchange between the Brangwen sisters neatly encapsulates much of the critical commentary about Ken Russell: ‘He’s got go.’ ‘Yes, but where does his go go to?’ (This was also directly sourced from the novel.)

For once, Russell had largely sympathetic producers in the Americans Martin Rosen and Larry Kramer. Kramer also wrote the first-draft screenplay, and he and Rosen initially tried to interest Peter Brook, Jack Clayton, Stanley Kubrick and Silvio Narizzano (_Georgy Girl_) in the project before it fell into Russell’s hands. More usually fired up by music and visual art, Russell had never read any Lawrence, although he threw himself with gusto into rewriting Kramer’s script, and was later miffed not to receive a co-writing credit and share the resulting Oscar nomination – although his first and only Best Director nod must have been somewhat mollifying. Kramer’s subsequent screenwriting work brought him financial security, allowing him to turn to more heartfelt but less commercially appealing gay themes that were clearly nascent in _Women in Love_. Several people have quipped that the film could equally be titled _Men in Love_ – the relationship between Rupert and Oliver Reed’s Gerald Crich is clearly just as intense, both spiritually and physically.

Talking of which, Russell was lucky that the British Board of Film Censors was then overseen by the liberally minded John Trevelyan, although it was only two years since the BBFC had first passed a scene featuring prolonged frontal female nudity (Jonas Cornell’s _Hugs and Kisses_, 1967). In his memoir _What the Censor Saw_ (1973), Trevelyan recalled: ‘We thought [_Women in Love_] a fine film, a view that was shared by the critics and the public, and although there were strong and explicit sex scenes, we passed it without cuts. This film included a remarkably brilliant scene in which two young men wrestled naked. We had to consider this carefully, but decided to pass it; in a sense this was a milestone in censorship since male frontal nudity was still a rarity. We had little criticism, possibly because of the film’s undoubted brilliance.’

By contrast, the entire wrestling scene was removed from South American prints, to Russell’s great amusement. He told John Baxter that: ‘Gerald simply locked the door, then there was a direct cut to the two men lying naked on the carpet side by side, panting. It became known as The Great Buggering Scene and filled the cinemas for months. So much for the subtleties of censorship.’

When they’re not engaging in elaborate bonding rituals, Rupert and Gerald become involved with Ursula (Jennie Linden) and Gudrun Brangwen (Glenda Jackson), sisters who reject society’s intended straitjacketing from the start. They wouldn’t yet have the vote (granted in 1918, just before the film’s setting, but only to women over 30 with property qualifications), but there’s a strong sense of a cultural sea-change, even if it would take another few decades to fully flower – parallels between the early 1920s and the late 1960s summer-of-love era are of course intentional. The Brangwen sisters’ early search for ‘love’ stems less from a great romantic passion than a desire to escape, be it with the intellectual iconoclast Rupert or the well-heeled Gerald – although it’s his willingness to spur on a clearly reluctant horse that has the most visible effect on Gudrun. Jackson’s Oscar-winning performance, combining cerebral aloofness with unbridled sensuality, is beyond praise: Russell wanted a younger Bette Davis, and that’s precisely what he got.
