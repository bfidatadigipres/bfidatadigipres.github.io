_+ Q&A with director Jim Archer, and writer-actors David Earl and Chris Hayward_

A winning new ‘odd couple’ comedy based on a successful short film. Comedian David Earl (_Derek_, _Extras_, _After Life_) co-wrote and stars as the eccentric recluse Brian, who, trapped on a remote farm in northern Wales, tinkers meaninglessly with scrap machinery. One day, to combat loneliness, he makes something that actually works: Charles, a seven-foot tall walking and talking robot (Hayward) with his own awkward but loveable personality and a taste for cabbages. They quickly develop a father-son bond (put to the test during the bot’s ‘angry teen’ phase), and take on the village bullies – to comic and heart-warming effect. It’s the film we need now. Unmissable.  
**Mia Bays, Director of BFI Film Fund**  

**Director’s Statement**  
_Brian and Charles_ is about a lot of things. I wouldn’t want to dictate to anyone who watches it what interpretation they should have. Primarily, it’s about loneliness and the power of friendship and companionship. Charles is such a blank slate that you can put a lot of interpretations onto him and I think it works. When we made the short (which inspired the film), we got a lot of comments about how people related to their relationship to the characters in totally different ways, whether it is raising a child or having a parent with dementia. Therefore, whatever interpretation you have, you are CORRECT! But also, it is there just to make you laugh.

It’s such a bizarre premise and Charles is so ridiculous looking that my intention with this film was always to treat it as seriously as possible. Make it look like a real documentary, not a tried and tested Mockumentary but something more cinematic and atmospheric. Initially, I wanted to do that as I thought it would be funny to treat these characters completely earnestly. But additionally, in the story, there is a lot of heart and tragedy, and it deserved to be taken seriously. You need to believe in their relationship and that Charles is more than a mannequin’s head stuck onto a washing machine. Once we achieved this, then I think the comedy takes care of itself. I’m excited to see if audiences agree and can’t wait to share it with you all!
