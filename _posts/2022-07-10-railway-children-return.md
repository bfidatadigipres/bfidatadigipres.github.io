+_Q&A with writer Danny Brocklehurst, director Morgan Matthews, producer Jemma Rodgers and actors Jenny Agutter, KJ Aikens, John Bradley, Beau Gadsden, Eden Hamilton, Austin Haynes and Zac Cudby._  

**What’s it about?**  
A group of children are evacuated to a village in Yorkshire during WWII, where a retired head teacher has set up a school for them. Soon, some of the youngsters find a soldier who’s hiding away far from home... In this much-anticipated follow up to the beloved original, Jenny Agutter revisits the iconic role of Bobbie over 50 years on.  

**The Genesis of the Film**  
‘My adopted daughter had come home from primary school, where she’d been learning about the evacuee children in World War II,’ recalls producer Jemma Rodgers about the origins of the project.

‘Because her journey to us as an adopted child had been via a train and she’d shared the experience of the evacuee children, being moved on a train to a new family, it affected her profoundly.’

Looking for a film to show her daughter that reflected her own experience, Rodgers found herself turning to the beloved children’s classic, _The Railway Children_ – Lionel Jeffries’ 1970 adaptation of E. Nesbit’s tale of adventure and steam trains.

The story of children – Bobbie (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) – whose move from London to Yorkshire in the wake of their father being accused of espionage prompted a new life alongside the rails and new friendships, _The Railway Children_ has become a family favourite over the years, and inextricably linked to the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway where it was filmed.

As Rodgers watched the film with her daughters in 2018, inspiration hit. As a former resident of Haworth, the location for Jeffries’ film, Rodgers realised that all the places in the film were unchanged in the 21st century. ‘I got to the end of the film and I thought, “Why hasn’t anyone done a sequel?” All the locations are exactly the same!

‘I literally stopped watching the film, went to my office, and started looking at the numbers. If Bobbie is 16 in the original film, to set it in World War II she would have to have been in her fifties. I started concocting a plan: if Bobbie was a grandma, then she’d have to have a daughter. And then the evacuee kids would come from the city, so there was a change when they moved to the country…’
