Join us for a day of films and talks as we reflect on the tragic 2012 massacre of mineworkers in Marikana, South Africa. Co-chairs from Marikana Solidarity are: Amanda Latimer (Kingston University) and Cecil Gutzmore (retired activist and academic). Films screening include: _Winnie_, _Miners Shot Down_ and _Blue Notes and Exiled Voices._

**The Marikana Solidarity Collective** is a UK-based campaign working towards justice for the victims of the 2012 Marikana Massacre.

**Imruh Bakari**  is a filmmaker and writer who has since the 1960s, lived and worked in the UK and a number of African countries in the areas of film production and film studies, culture and the creative industries. He currently lectures in Film Studies at the University of Winchester. His published work includes _African Experiences of Cinema_ (BFI, 1996), co-edited with Mbye Cham, and various articles on African and Caribbean cinema and film culture; and the poetry collections _Without Passport or Apology_ (Smokestack Books, 2017) and _The Madman in this House_ (Smokestack Books, 2021). Among his film productions is _Blue Notes and Exiled Voices_ (1991).

**Asanda Benya** is a senior lecturer in the Sociology Department at University of Cape Town. She completed her PhD at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in 2016. Her thesis was on the construction of gendered identities of women who work underground in the mines.
