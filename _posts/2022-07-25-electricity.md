_+ intro and discussion._

Like an ‘Electrical storm that starts in my skull’... Those are the words Lily (Deyn), a young woman with epilepsy, uses to describe the sensations experienced from sporadic seizures – here vividly illustrated with surreal, hallucinatory visuals. Trading the desolate beauty of the Lancashire coast for London’s anonymous city streets, Lily finds herself alone and drifting in the increasingly desperate search for her lost brother. 
The Epilepsy Society were advisors on the film.

**RELAXED SERIES:**
**NATURAL CONNECTIONS**<br>

**A three-film series curated by Benjamin Brown, founder of Citizen Autistic.**<br>

‘Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.’  Marie Curie (1867-1934)

Marie-Curie happens to be the name of a central character in _Frequencies_, the opening feature in a three-film series exploring difference and the sensory effects the ambient sights and sounds of nature can have upon both body and mind.

Throughout the series sound is made tactile, something to be touched and felt, through expressive, multi-layered sound design and sonorous soundscapes humming with the low-bass frequencies and rhythmical droning of today’s hyper-stimulated world.
