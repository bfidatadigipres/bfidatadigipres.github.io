Jimmy Cliff brings a knockout soundtrack and charisma aplenty to this classic crime drama. A film that needs no introduction to anyone with so much as the slightest interest in reggae or Jamaican culture, _The Harder They Come_ celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Besides its credentials as an explosive action thriller with a killer soundtrack, it is universally credited with introducing reggae and the roots movement to the world as a serious cultural proposition. Perry Henzell’s unfiltered portrait of Jamaica’s music industry, the emerging Rasta faith and how so many Jamaicans lived, both in the town and the country, redefined a genre of music, giving it context and weight. Five decades on, that excitement and sense of discovery remain undimmed.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

**A contemporary review**  
The plot of _The Harder They Come_ was apparently in part suggested by Jimmy Cliff’s own life story, and to that extent the film is as much a star vehicle for him as any Hollywood version of the country hick making his way in the big city might be. But Perry Henzell (a graduate from BBC drama and, like most of the crew and cast a Jamaican) has used his simple plot as a springboard to something altogether more ambitious.

The film is the first Jamaican feature, and it’s alive with a fierce post-colonial national pride (extending to dialogue in Jamaican patois, warranting subtitles), and an equally fierce hatred of the heritage from three hundred years of colonial rule, expressed in a well-developed left-wing critique of the capitalist society and the repressive church. Behind the action lies a series of comparisons: between orthodox ‘missionary’ religion and the native Rastafarian sect; between church music (which sublimates physical feeling) and reggae (which boisterously expresses it); between shanty town and luxury villas; between Jamaican native culture and the society of the Jamaican/American bosses. The broad view emerges naturally from Henzell’s careful emphasis on detail, which is always integral to the action: a domino game in a back alley, a noisy audience laughing at an especially violent Italian Western. The methodical analysis of corruption within the police force, and within the music business, is notably uncompromising. And Henzell’s expert use of a largely non-professional cast gives the film an air of social authenticity.

This said, it must be admitted that _The Harder They Come_ has little but the general area of concern in common with say, Latin American agit-prop filmmaking. Henzell has spent many years making commercials, and his film has production values glossy enough to compare with anything from the United States. The use of reggae background music is as commercial as it is ‘revolutionary’. To Henzell’s credit, however, he knows this very well himself and does not end the film with a pseudo-radical gesture. Ivan’s death is certainly heroic, but its heroism is mitigated by his spending his final minutes of life imagining himself the invincible super-hero of a movie, cheered on by a theatre audience. The film’s awareness of its own limitations consolidates its remarkable achievement.
