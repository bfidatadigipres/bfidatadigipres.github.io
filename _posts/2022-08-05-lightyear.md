**What’s it about?**  
Young astronaut Buzz Lightyear is the member of a spaceship crew who are stranded on a planet 4.2 million light years from Earth. His repeated attempts to return home backfire, but he perseveres with help from his feline robot companion Sox and others. However, with the dastardly Zurg and his army on the horizon, will Buzz succeed? In the _Toy Story_ universe, this is the film Andy watched that made him want to have his own  space-age toy.


**Lightyear**  
Every cinephile loves a good hero – someone to admire, someone to root for. Heroes overcome insurmountable obstacles to save the day. And the best heroes – the ones who live on long after their films hit the big screen – are, at heart, human. They have flaws and fears – they’re utterly relatable, even as they soar to greatness.

Buzz Lightyear is such a hero – in fact, he’s the kind of big-screen phenomenon that inspired a successful line of toys. That’s what filmmakers pictured when creating the character for Pixar Animation Studios’ 1995 feature film _Toy Story_. That story placed Buzz Lightyear – the toy in this case – centre stage as the brand-new, highly sought-after action figure that gives vintage pull-string Sheriff Woody a run for his money as Andy’s favourite. Fast forward 21 years, and director Angus MacLane found himself asking: What movie inspired Andy to beg for a fancy toy with lasers, karate-chop action and aerodynamic space wings? ‘_Lightyear_ is the movie that Andy, his friends and probably most of the rest of the world saw,’ says MacLane. ‘I wanted to make something that felt true to those fun, big-budget popcorn films.’

A sci-fi action-adventure and the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear, _Lightyear_ follows the legendary Space Ranger on an intergalactic adventure. ‘I did a lot of research, breaking down the nature of genre thrillers,’ says MacLane. ‘I knew Buzz would have to face a big problem, and I liked the sci-fi element of time dilation. There’s a rich history of character-out-of-time heroics: Captain America, Flash Gordon,  Buck Rogers, to name a few.

‘They say you can’t live in the past, but what if you could?’ continues MacLane. ‘We all wonder what it would be like to go back in time, but instead we’re jumping forward in time. That’s the truth I wanted to build for _Lightyear_ – nostalgia for the past while rapidly jumping into the future.’
