_+ Q&A with Molly Dineen, Blacker Dread and Naptali, hosted by the renowned DJ and remixer, Radio 1Xtra’s Seani B_

After a ten-year absence, BAFTA award-winning filmmaker Molly Dineen returned with this intimate feature documentary, which tells the story of renowned Jamaican-born reggae record shop owner, music producer, businessman, father, son and community pillar Blacker Dread. Blacker invites Dineen to film his mother’s funeral, opening the door to his life at a time of great personal crisis. As the story unfolds, he reflects on the issues that have dogged his last 40 years in the UK: inequality, poverty, crime and racism, and why he sent his youngest child back to school in Jamaica.

A 2-disc BFI DVD, _The Molly Dineen Collection Volume 4: Being Blacker / Sound Business_ will be released on Monday 8 August. Cult documentary _Sound Business_ (1981) follows the legendary Sir Coxsone Sound System and Young Lion, offering a fascinating insight into the workings of sound systems in the 1980s. Extras include a short film dedicated to the memory of Jamaican reggae singer, producer and sound-system operator Sugar Minott.

**Me a Talk Fi You**  
Both _Being Blacker_ and _Sound Business_ give rare insights for outsiders into contemporary Black culture and community building. Filmmaker Molly Dineen’s camera catches glimpses of the subtexts and the contexts, the resilience and the fragility of the world within a world of the Black communities in London, particularly of Blacker Dread’s generation.

_Sound Business_ shows community being performed. On one level as literal performances by sound system crews that intersperse and underlay the narrative, and on another level the performance by the interviewees. The film’s subjects explain and translate their culture for Dineen. _Being Blacker_ is different. The tragedy that affects Blacker Dread charges the story by showing how the community he is within draws up and around him in support  and disbelief.

In _Sound Business_, DJ Country translates some of his patter for the camera, explaining some of the patois and the references a general audience wouldn’t understand. In _Being Blacker_ there’s a scene in which Blacker asks his friend Naptali why he’s talking ‘like an Englishman’. Naptali says, ‘I’m talking for her [Dineen], for the audience behind the camera.’ In contrast Blacker says, ‘Me a talk fi you.’ Although he is joking around with Naptali this phrase marks a boundary between the mainstream white culture with which Blacker can work when he’s negotiating on behalf of the community, and the Black community whom he tries to nurture and support. This instinct of translating, code-shifting, between identity community and mainstream community is endemic for people of colour, and in this case especially for people of African descent. The way that British history has been shaped by people from the African diaspora has a particular meaning for those first- and second-generation people of the Windrush era.

DIY community building also meant that sound system culture was never only a music scene. In _Sound Business_ DJ Country explains how he would use his sets to give community news headlines. In a performance shown in the film he speaks about the New Cross Fire. This fire at a house party of young Black people in 1981, the same year that Dineen made _Sound Business_, killed thirteen. Feeling that there was a cover up of how the fire broke out, Black people came together to march in the first Black People’s Day of Action, a precursor to the cross-cultural Black Lives Matter marches in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in America.

The Black Peoples Day of Action in March 1981 was part of a continuum of community activism that wanted to find more to living than having to constantly protect one another from racist onslaught and subtle discrimination. The uprisings of the 1980s in Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham and in Brixton in London, characterised at the time as riots, were only part of the story. There were also groups working for a collective empowerment. One such group was led by the late Len Garrison to set up the Black Cultural Archives, an institution still present in Brixton which preserves and celebrates the histories of Black people in the UK. Another example would be Blacker Dread’s record shop on Coldharbour Lane, which we see in _Being Blacker_ function as a meeting point for community and a space in which and from which Blacker could provide cross-generational advice and support. It’s never only about the music for Blacker. It’s about community. He’s working for them, talking to them. In his words again, ‘Me a talk fi you.’

**Seani B**  
Radio DJ, Presenter, Label Owner, Club DJ, Remixer, Producer – Seani B wears all of these titles with great aplomb! In the mid 90’s he amalgamated his technical skills and his knowledge of crowd pleasing and released a bootleg dancehall reggae remix of the Case and Foxy Brown classic track ‘Touch Me, Tease Me’. Demand grew for his unique sound, which prompted him to set up his own production company, Big League Productions. Before long, some of the world’s biggest artists were feeling the ‘Remix Kid’ touch. The Big League record label was next to follow, featuring collaborations with the Dancehall  ‘A’ list.

Seani joined BBC 1Xtra at its inception in 2002 with the award winning show _Seani B’s Mixlab_, which went against the grain of conventional single genre music programming at the time. After a consistent and varied run of international bookings as a club and festival DJ, he went back into the studio as a producer in 2016, during which he won a Grammy for producing tracks on the Morgan Heritage album _Strictly Roots_.

The world’s leading dancehall and reggae DJ, his weekly BBC 1Xtra show is the most listened to specialist programme on the network, as well as having amassed over 90 million views for his sessions from Jamaica. His ‘This is BrukOut’ column in Europe’s biggest Black newspaper, _The Voice_, has attracted much praise for its informed and relaxed style, giving an insight into the world of music from the Caribbean.

In 2021 he was awarded the prestigious Broadcasters Press Guild Award for Best Broadcaster Of The Year across all radio programmes in the UK.
