Nicholas Ray’s _Bigger than Life_ is among the most radical examples of what may be the most radical genre in American cinema: the small-town melodrama. Though long considered unworthy of serious attention – aimed as it was at the despised female audience – this genre is single-mindedly concerned with the nightmare world of compulsory heterosexuality. The fact that alternatives to heterosexuality couldn’t conceivably be depicted in an American film of the 1940s or 1950s was, far from a limitation, one of the factors that enabled Sam Wood’s _Kings Row_, Douglas Sirk’s _All That Heaven Allows_, Vincente Minnelli’s _Some Came Running_ and Max Ophuls’  _The Reckless Moment_ to pursue their projects without compromise. Indeed, as soon as it became possible for such alternatives to be openly portrayed, the small-town melodrama effectively vanished, playing itself out via a series of films (none of them in fact set in small American towns) about the nightmare world of homosexuality (Donen’s _Staircase_, Friedkin’s _The Boys in the Band_, Aldrich’s _The Killing of Sister George_), and now existing only as postmodern pastiche (Haynes’ _Far from Heaven_).

_Bigger than Life_ occupies an ambiguous position in relation to the small-town melodrama, since it somewhat tentatively defines itself as a social problem film. The ‘problem’ in question is a wonder drug, cortisone, which alters the personality of mild-mannered schoolteacher Ed Avery (James Mason), causing him to demonstrate megalomaniac tendencies and eventually attempt to kill his wife Lou (Barbara Rush) and son Richie (Christopher Olsen). When I first saw _Bigger than Life_, at the National Film Theatre in 1988, an embarrassed BFI employee stood up after the screening and assured us that cortisone was now considered completely safe. This announcement was greeted with laughter of the slightly nervous kind – I think we were all, at some level, aware that though cortisone may have been safe, the American nuclear family (Ray’s real concern) was as dangerous as ever.

For Ray, cortisone is simply a way of bringing to the surface tendencies that already exist within both Ed and the world he inhabits. Seldom has the idea of the bourgeois home as prison been pursued with such remorseless logic. Lou, though literally free to walk out her front door, must eventually confront the fact that, in a society which sees wives as having no autonomous existence, she is, for all intents and purposes, held captive within a house ruled by her husband. Ed follows a similar trajectory, gradually realising that, as an adult male in a patriarchy, he has the power of life and death over his wife and child. Yet both Ed and Lou express subconscious resentment of the constrictions their middle-class lifestyle imposes on them: as in Vincente Minnelli’s films, this resentment is manifested through the destruction of decor: Ed ‘accidentally’ destroying a vase while playing football; Lou smashing the bathroom mirror.

Though less widely recognised than the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, _Bigger than Life_ casts a long shadow over America’s cinema. The scene in which Ed takes Lou to buy a dress strikingly anticipates a similar dress-buying sequence in Alfred Hitchcock’s _Vertigo_ (1958), and Ray’s film was essentially remade by Stanley Kubrick as _The Shining_ (1980), with a haunted hotel replacing the wonder drug as the device that brings out hitherto suppressed homicidal tendencies. At another extreme, Steven Spielberg’s _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ (1977) provides a right-wing variation on this material, with the central character’s maniacal behaviour seen as an entirely reasonable response to an objectively verifiable phenomenon.<br>
**Brad Stevens, _Sight and Sound_, September 2007**<br>

_Bigger than Life_, which concerns the effects of cortisone on a schoolteacher (James Mason) who has contracted a painful, incurable inflammation of the arteries – an objective correlative, perhaps, for Ray’s own vision? – is obviously less ‘personal’ [than _In a Lonely_ Place] in any autobiographical sense, but its implications are more universal. Its real subject is not the drug itself but what it reveals about Ed Avery; and beyond that, what Ed Avery reveals about the society he inhabits and – to a greater and lesser extent – emulates.

_Bigger than Life_ is a profoundly upsetting exposure of middle-class aspirations because it virtually defines madness – Avery’s drug-induced psychosis – as taking these values seriously. Each emblem of the American Dream implicitly honoured by Avery in the opening scenes (his ideals about education, his respect for class and social status, his desire for his son ‘to improve himself’) is systematically turned on its head, converted from dream to nightmare, by becoming only more explicit in his behaviour. The dramatic function of his incurable disease and his taking of cortisone, carrying the respective promises of death and superlife, is to act on the slick magazine ads that he and his family try to inhabit in much the same way that the doctor’s X-ray of his torso illuminates his terminal condition: an appearance of normality is subverted before our eyes, bit by bit, until it achieves the Gothic dimensions of a horror story that has always existed beneath the surface of his life.

Returning to school after his release from the hospital, Ed tells his wife Lou that he feels ‘ten feet tall’, and a grotesque low-angle shot of him as he turns towards the school building echoes and parodies this notion; but as he walks away from the camera, his body becomes progressively dwarfed by the building – which, for all its apparent mediocrity, is a lot taller than ten feet. Similarly, a scene where Ed, playing the big shot, forces Lou to purchase gaudy clothes which they can’t afford, undermines the Hollywood images that inspire such a gesture to the point where they become loathsome – deranged and obscene. And Ed’s monomaniacal concern for his son’s ‘improvement’, a direct consequence of his unadmitted despair, reaches its apex when, after hearing a church sermon, he decides to ‘sacrifice’ his son to his ideals by killing him with a pair of scissors. When Lou reminds him that God told Abraham to spare Isaac, he can only reply with the reductio ad absurdum of his outsized egotism: ‘God was wrong.’

A general sense that, insofar as He exists at all, ‘God was wrong,’ infuses the world of Ray’s films, from the nervous instability of his compositions to the unrelieved torment of his heroes. In a rare and unprecedented moment of rebellion against Ed’s demands, Lou slams the door of a medicine cabinet and the mirror cracks. Ed sees himself fragmented and duplicated in the broken surface – a crowd of images alienated from one another that gives the lie to his fantasy that he maintains a consistent, logical and continuous identity.<br>
