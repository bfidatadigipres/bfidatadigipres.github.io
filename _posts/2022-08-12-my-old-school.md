_+ Q&A with director Jono McLeod and actors Alan Cumming, Clare Grogan and Lulu_

**Director’s Statement**  
_My Old School_ is a documentary which finally reveals the truth behind one of the most incredible stories of the past 30 years. Featuring interviews with my old classmates and teachers, together we tell how a 32-year-old man tricked his way into our school – and, for the first time, how Brandon Lee’s true identity was revealed.

Playing with its theme of identity and deception, this documentary stars the internationally renowned actor Alan Cumming as both the face and the voice of Brandon, albeit never at the same time. In an astonishing performance, Alan perfectly lip-syncs to an audio interview I recorded with the imposter himself.  In addition to that, Alan also provides the voice of the young Brandon in our animated flashback scenes. As Alan notes, ‘This is a great Scottish tale, one that gripped the entire nation when it first broke back in the 1990s, and this documentary retells it from the point of view of the pupils and teachers it all happened to! Their experience, their truth and the legacy they still struggle with will, I believe, now captivate a global audience. It's told with a quirky sensitivity, humour and honesty. It's a story that has always fascinated me and I am delighted to play a part in its telling.’

One of the roles Alan is best known for is class nerd Sandy Frink in _Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion_. But Alan isn’t the only actor in our cast who’s been in an iconic high school movie. Our teaching staff includes _Gregory’s Girl_ herself, Clare Grogan, and the star (and US Billboard chart-topping singer) of _To Sir with Love_, Lulu. And just like in that movie classic of 1967, Lulu sings our title song, the Steely Dan hit ‘My Old School’. Her powerhouse of a performance plays over a fun end credit sequence where cartoon characters meet their real life counterparts.

Animated flashback scenes with cartoon characters evoke high school life from 25 years ago. While drawing inspiration from MTV’s 1990s high school icon, _Daria_, the film also nods to the animation styles of the 1970s. Producers John Archer and Olivia Lichtenstein say, ‘This is a story that will remind you of your schooldays; an unforgettable tale told with warmth, verve and originality by Class 5C, who lived through this extraordinary deception and have never forgotten it. And now, neither will you!’

_My Old School_ is an exciting and unique project – a real-life rollercoaster of a story, told on film in a completely new way.
