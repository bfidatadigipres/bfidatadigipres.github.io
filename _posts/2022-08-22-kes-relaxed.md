_+ intro and discussion._

15-year-old Billy Casper struggles every day. Not conforming to anyone’s expectations he is repeatedly humiliated at school and home. Discovering falconry transforms his experience of the world, finding new personal freedom and learning a real skill. Filmed in Barnsley with mainly non-professional actors, this is a tough and unforgettable drama about human dignity – as relevant now as it was when it was made.

Please join us for an informal discussion in the Blue Room after the screening. The discussion will be hosted by Benjamin Brown, Citizen Autistic: The London Autism Film Club.
