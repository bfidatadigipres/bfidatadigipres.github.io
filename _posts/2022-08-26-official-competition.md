After securing financial backing from an ailing business mogul, independent cinema darling and Cannes Palme d’Or-winning filmmaker Lola Cuevas (Penélope Cruz) sets out to make an experimental adaptation of a much-loved literary work. In the lead roles she casts two actors with radically different approaches: the acclaimed but stiflingly snobbish thespian Ivan Torres (Oscar Martínez) against the handsome but superficial screen icon Felix (Antonio Banderas). A hysterically funny, well-written satire of the film industry, directors and film stars, powered by a trilogy of fun, high-energy campy performances from Cruz, Banderas, Martínez.

**Directors’ Notes**

**Mariano Cohn:** For some time now we’ve been meaning to get a movie made together with Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas. They like our movies and both actors were interested in working together. Finally, we met in London to exchange ideas and we shared with them the seed of what would end up becoming the central axis of _Official Competition_. We needed a third leading man, so we called on Oscar Martínez, who had already starred in a movie with us, _The Distinguished Citizen_, and whose work Penelope and Antonio really liked. The Mediapro Studio co-produced our last two films _My Masterpiece_ and _4x4_, and we have a great artistic and professional affinity with them. Their commitment to _Official Competition_ was absolute from the very outset and we began working on the script for _Official Competition_ together with Andrés Duprat with the purpose of showing, through fiction, how actors build  emotion. Audiences will see the mechanisms, techniques, tactics and procedures involved.

**Gastón Duprat:** There are many films that show how a film is made, the production problems, the difficulties and issues of carrying out a project. But there’s nothing exactly like the kind of stuff actors get up to, to make us cry, to make us laugh, to generate emotion. This film investigates this complex and extraordinary relationship, generally hidden from view of the general public. Undoubtedly, Penelope, Antonio and Oscar were seduced by the possibility of making a film where they could talk about the trade and truly reflect on issues affecting the profession from an informed perspective. _Official Competition_ is structured around the rehearsals prior to the shooting of a film. Each rehearsal works in an almost autonomous and self-conclusive way and is a fascinating masterclass on how these three acting talents build emotion with the audience. Addressing issues such as the process of artistic creation, professional competence, egos, the need for prestige and recognition, the different schools of acting and the tensions between artists from different backgrounds and with different objectives is one of the challenges we’re most passionate about in _Official Competition_.

**Production notes**

A film titled _Official Competition_ obviously calls for a major festival slot – which indeed this stylish farce enjoyed in Venice last year, providing light relief in a heavyweight line-up that might well have featured the earnest likes of _Rivalry_, the apocryphal film seen rehearsed here. But the title also invokes competition as rivalrous warfare, and Argentinian directors Gastón Duprat and Mariano Cohn, with co-writer Andrés Duprat, cheerfully riff on all the myths about cinematic creation as extended process of ruthless combat.

The joke is on the kind of cinema that takes itself seriously for the wrong reasons. A millionaire, yearning for a new prestige monument to himself, and insisting on only the very best, options an acclaimed novel and hires a Palme d’Or-winning female director (the rarest of breeds). She casts two differently pompous male leads to play warring brothers. One is international star Félix, played by Antonio Banderas, who spoofs himself with relish as a lunkish ageing playboy. Banderas is the butt of one of the film’s slyest jokes, when Félix’s co-star, stage eminence Iván, snorts at the idea of any actor becoming a token Latino for Hollywood (a nice jab at the star of _The Mask of Zorro_, 1998, and _Spy Kids_, 2001). The solemnly high-minded Iván – played by Oscar Martínez, who won Venice’s Best Actor award in 2016 for the same directors’  _The Distinguished Citizen_ – sneers at the idea of award ceremonies, but secretly rehearses a magnificently self-aggrandising Oscars speech.

An electrically coiffed Penélope Cruz, meanwhile, plays Lola Cuevas, an unpredictable director with bizarre methods for psyching up her actors. (One ploy involves a cruel use of their various award trophies.) Sexual tensions also come into play, the two men resenting the instructions of a confident younger woman; Lola, a lesbian, puts them in their place by showing them the right way to kiss their female co-star, an extended gag involving a panoply of microphones resembling an art installation.

_Official Competition_ is a cannily paced, visually gorgeous pleasure: staged in a glossily cavernous arts foundation, it’s designed by Alain Bainée (elegantly repurposing locations including the San Lorenzo de El Escorial auditorium near Madrid) and shot by Arnau Valls Colomer with an eye for highly composed tableaux. It’s up to the viewer, of course, to guess which director Lola might be modelled on – her butterfly glasses suggest Isabel Coixet or Lucrecia Martel, but then both Cruz and Banderas could no doubt tell a story or two about the working methods of Pedro Almodóvar.
