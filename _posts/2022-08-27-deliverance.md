Made for national television in Hindi, Premchand’s searing story about caste exploitation in rural India resulted in Ray’s bleakest film. Low caste untouchable Dukhi is ordered by an upper caste Brahmin priest to cut trees in the scorching midday sun. Om Puri and Smita Patil deliver powerful performances as the poor villagers.

_Deliverance_ was made for television, but then so was Krzysztof Kieslowski’s _Dekalog_, with which it shares the same moral force. An untouchable peasant (Om Puri, heartbreaking) is ruthlessly exploited by the local Brahmin, forced to perform hours of hard labour at the height of summer in exchange for a routine favour required by India’s caste system. But it’s after things go disastrously wrong and the Brahmin moves into full-on cover-up mode that the film’s underlying anger becomes clear. Ray avoids making any overt political statements, but these would merely say what is already obvious: the insult to an entire social class conveyed by the Brahmin’s final ‘cleansing’ gesture is like a sledgehammer to the teeth.
