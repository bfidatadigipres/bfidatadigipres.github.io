**Panellists: Producer/director Jonnie Turpie; Original Channel 4 Commissioner Youth/Music, Mike Bolland; Current Head of Youth and Digital Channel 4  Karl Warner; Producer The Tube, Malcolm Gerrie.**

With its unique blend of magazine format and live music transmitted live from Tyne Tees Television in Newcastle, _The Tube_ immediately struck a new tone and style.  It was further enforced by the daring presentation of a very young Jools Holland and Paula Yates. Breaking such major acts as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, it was the show’s ability to seek out emerging talent that remains its enduring legacy.  This screening of highlights is followed by a panel discussion with creatives.

In handing over filmmaking of some sequences to local community groups and regional workshops, power was shifted to young people, unleashing authentic access and youth programming with a new sense of raw energy and commitment. Featuring additional clips from shows such as _Giro: Is This the Modern World_, from the Birmingham Video and Film Workshop, those involved describe these unique productions and their impact on youth programming.

**The Tube**  
In 1982, Andrea Wonfor headed Tyne Tees’ youth department. It became obvious to her, through interviews with children, that magazine shows had an unimaginative dependence on promotional videos. With her new format, Wonfor sought to regain some spark by devising a rock concert inside a television studio, not unlike _Ready, Steady, Go!_ (ITV, 1963-66).

Transmitted live from Newcastle, _The Tube_ (a reference to the studio entrance) was launched during Channel 4’s opening week. Its hosts were ex-Squeeze keyboardist Jools Holland and the provocative Paula Yates. The pair’s confidently irreverent approach chimed well with Channel 4’s mould-breaking self-image.

The series supported the rock and pop aristocracy as well as the independent music scenes, touching on many innovative new styles emerging from America.  In a teeming decade, _The Tube_ had a refreshing lack of musical snobbery, proudly developing close relationships with the likes of U2, Eurythmics, Culture Club and Duran Duran. For Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Madonna and Terence Trent D’Arby, first appearances were critical. Indeed, the spectacle of Frankie... in bondage gear was enough to get them signed overnight.

A string of supporting presenters guided the programme content. Scottish journalist Muriel Gray made her mark here, as did Leslie Ash when she deputised for Yates throughout series two. Famously, Felix Howard, at the time barely in his teens, joined for the final run. Notable guest hosts included Peter Cook, Nicholas Parsons and John Peel.

‘Rock concert’ constituted just half of _The Tube_, with a magazine hour acting as warm up. Fashion items, filmed reports and backstage interviews were typical fare. Comedy too, with _The Comic Strip Presents..._ team making regular appearances.

After five years of fighting its corner, _The Tube_ collapsed in April 1987 under the weight of internal bickering. Holland inadvertently stoked tensions with a colourful slip during a live trailer, leading to a six-week suspension. It did, however, inspire the title of his comic travelogue _The Groovy Fellers_ (Channel 4, 1989) with  Rowland Rivron.

A _Tube_ revival was proposed in 1994, but the original producers instead developed _The White Room_ (Channel 4, 1995-96). A millennium special, hosted by Chris Moyles and Donna Air, aired on 20 November 1999 as _Apocalypse Tube_.  Even then, there was no firm intent for a new series.
