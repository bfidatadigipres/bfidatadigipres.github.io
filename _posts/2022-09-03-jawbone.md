_+ Q&A with writer-actor Johnny Harris, actors Michael Smiley and Ray Winstone and director Thomas Napper_

Marking the arrival of a new photobook _Jawbone: The Autobiography of a Film_, Johnny Harris reunites with his fellow cast members to reflect on the making of their brutal and authentic British boxing drama. The film follows the journey of Jimmy (fiercely portrayed by Harris, who also wrote the screenplay), a former junior boxing champion who after hitting rock bottom, returns to his childhood club hoping to train and fight again.

A washed-up fighter returning to the ring. One more big fight. One last chance at redemption. Stop us if you’ve heard it all before – many, many times. Certainly, there’s little new in this modestly proportioned British independent offering, apart from a rather oblique title inspired by a biblical reference to strongman Samson’s implement of choice. Cinema history, however, teaches us never to underestimate the resilience of this particular story outline: Sylvester Stallone’s original _Rocky_ (1976) and Darren Aronofsky’s  _The Wrestler_ (2008), for instance, have shown that the clichés can indeed spring to life again if you resist the temptation to reinvent the material and instead commit to its hackneyed truths wholeheartedly. That’s exactly what writer-producer-star Johnny Harris has done here, delivering a purposeful, evidently sincere drama that’s surprisingly involving even though we can guess pretty much all its moves in advance.

Probably best known as the reprehensible pimp in 2006’s _London to Brighton_, and a regular in three series of Shane Meadows’s TV youth saga _This Is England_ (2010-15), Harris has carved out a solid list of credits in the past decade or so without quite assuming headlining status, and kudos to him for generating his own content to show off his range. As Jimmy McCabe, the one-time youth champion boxer now marinating in hard liquor, rage and self-loathing, he turns in a believably lived-in performance that’s convincing from the off, as director Thomas Napper’s camera confronts his bleary features in sundry full-on close-ups. We have only to look at this guy to know his story, and that same sense of presence and alertness extends to the film’s other key performers. You’d forgive veteran Ian McShane for simply phoning it in as yet another sleek crime boss, but his big scene here is absolutely on the money, conjuring steely threat behind faux bonhomie. Ray Winstone also hits top form as boxing-gym proprietor Bill, a wise and watchful older man who’s not about to waste a single breath or gesture. And almost eclipsing everyone is Michael Smiley – as ever, British independent cinema’s most valuable supporting turn – here totally in the zone as the good-egg cornerman whose palpable investment in the ebb and flow of the bloody climactic bout helps to bring a familiar scene emotionally alive.

Napper (in his feature debut after a string of high-profile second-unit assignments) also makes an astute contribution at this point, playing with the shutter speed to create a flickering effect that conveys the dynamic essence of the persuasive fight choreography, and helpfully providing a fresh visual approach when it’s really needed. Elsewhere, he is also very attuned to a specific sense of place, with repeated low-angled shots of Jimmy running under the old brick railway bridges just south of the Thames effectively building oppressive weight on the hard-pressed protagonist. A small detail, perhaps, but typical of a film in which the direction and performances are focused and effective in getting the absolute most out of the material in front of them. Not a groundbreaker, but certainly an appreciable lesson in potency of application.
