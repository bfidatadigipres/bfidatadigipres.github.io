In December 1951, 23-year-old medical student Ernesto Guevara, who in the future would become the iconic revolutionary leader ‘Che’, took a long motorcycle trip with his friend Alberto Granado on a Norton named  La Poderosa II (The Powerful One). They left Cordoba in central Argentina, headed first to Buenos Aires to visit Ernesto’s family, then speeded west to the coast of Chile, then north along the Pacific seaboard through Peru and Colombia, ending up in Venezuela in July 1952. This six-month mini-Odyssey, full of mishaps and chance meetings, was the basis for Guevara’s book  _The Motorcycle Diaries_, an impressionable, idealistic youth’s thoughtful commentary on his road encounters and the harsh realities of South American life, which became a backpack classic in the 1960s when Che’s fame was at its height.

In these morally more slippery times, the need for such positive political certainty has led to a revival of interest in Guevara, the most obvious manifestation of which is the elegiac new road movie based on the book from Brazilian director Walter Salles, which stars Gael Garda Bernal, possibly the most brilliant young actor of his generation, as Che and Rodrigo de la Serna as Granado. The film avoids the tub-thumping clichés of the average biopic, choosing to portray the dawning of Guevara’s social conscience by inference and mood rather than through overt political statement – at least until the climactic moment when he swims the Amazon in Peru from the bank where the medical workers sleep to the camp where the lepers they tend reside. Salles also weaves in close-u p photographic studies of South America’s poor.

I talked to Salles at Cannes in May, where he seemed envigorated by the way the film had come together through improvisation.

_With a figure as iconic as Che Guevara, how do you avoid the pitfalls of the biopic?_

It took us five years to make _The Motorcycle Diaries_ including three years of research before the filming began. We retraced Che’s journey through Latin America twice and we did many interviews with Alberto Granado, who is still alive, and with people who had met the two travellers in 1952. We realised this was a journey of two guys who were trying not only to find their own identity, but also what one could call a ‘Latin American identity’.

We had a solid screenplay by Puerto Rican writer Jose Rivera, who knew everything about Guevara and didn’t try to mythologise or demythologise. He tried to show Guevara and Granado as they could have been at that time as opposed to what they would become. But when we went on our version of their road trip we found that what was peripheral was as interesting as the road itself. So we started to improvise, and the film is a blend of very structured material and improvisation. We wanted to be faithful both to the book that inspired us and to the spirit of the journey: these two young guys who were completely open to the encounters they had.

_Which is why the film is full of so many real people._

Non-actors permeate the film. We encountered them on the road and incorporated them.

_One wonders what would have happened to Guevara if his sweetheart hadn’t dumped him. Would he have embraced the bourgeois life?_

Guevara has resonance today because his quest never ended. His desire to unveil the unknown was present in every moment of his life. At the age of 16 he bought a small engine which he put on a bike and toured the north of Argentina in a single month. When he was 23 he did this journey through Latin America at a time when people from his social class were more interested in Europe. We live in an age where people are blinded by cynicism and here you have a true idealist. We were tired of the rhetoric about the death of ideology and we wanted to make this film in order to believe in something again.

_There are many head-on, composed shots of the poor._

The human geography of those weathered faces was more appealing to us than the physical geography. We were influenced by Martin Chambi, a Peruvian photographer of the 1920s who was the first to take the camera out of the studio and photograph people in the streets. He treated people you would never have seen before as citizens, anticipating what the Italian neorealists did in the 1940s and 1950s. We wanted to be sensitive to the faces we encountered – for instance, as we were leaving a small hotel in Cuzco, a boy of about ten years old asked us if we would like to hear the untold history of the Incas. We said, ‘Yes, but on camera.’ And Gael and Rodrigo were so in tune with their characters that such improvisations were a joy to film.

_Did Gael Garcia Bernal really swim the Amazon?_

Gael swam for three days in the river, and when we were all tired, he’d say, ‘Let’s go one more time.’ That tells you what kind of actor he is. The scene of crossing the river was the last we shot, and when I said ‘Cut’, we all jumped in the Amazon, one by one. We gathered in the water and the night was completely still and the river seemed endless and the boat was pretty distant, and we started to swim together against the current towards the boat in complete silence. It was a very moving moment.

_When Ernesto says, ‘We’re the same people from Mexico down to Patagonia’, it seems like a personal statement for you._

Absolutely. This idea of one continent, one people, seemed utopian as we were starting this small Odyssey because we all came from different countries: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Brazil. But little by little we understood our frontiers were more porous than we imagined.

_How many people were on the shoot?_

It varied from a hundred in the leper colony in Peru – 70 of them non-actors – to 12 in the Peruvian Andes. Whenever we wanted to improvise, myself, our DoP Eric Gautier and the actors would run away from the main crew. Eric solves lighting problems naturally. Most DoPs would have tried to light the Amazon to show the crossing of the river but he just had a very small light on a zodiac turned towards Gael as he swam. If we’d shot in a more conventional way we would still be filming.

_How many motorbikes did you get through?_

Three Nortons we found in Argentina. Two were in miserable condition when we started, but Gustavo Agra, a genius mechanic in Buenos Aires, reconditioned them so they were running better than ever. The bikes in the accidents are what we called Nortukis: Suzukis transformed into Nortons. Those broke shamelessly every time we put them on the road, even before shooting the falls. The 1935 Nortons were way more solid than the 1989 Nortukis.
