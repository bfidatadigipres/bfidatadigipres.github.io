_On the Come Up_ is based on the _New York Times_ #1 best-selling novel by Angie Thomas (_The Hate U Give_) and is the feature directorial debut of Emmy-nominated actress Sanaa Lathan. _On the Come Up_  will hold its World Premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.

Starring newcomer Jamila C. Gray, _On the Come Up_ is the story of Bri, a gifted 16-year-old rapper, who attempts to take the battle rap scene by storm in order to lift up her family and do right by the legacy of her father – a local hip hop legend whose career was cut short by gang violence. But when her first hit song goes viral for all the wrong reasons, she finds herself torn between the authenticity that got her this far and the false persona that the industry wants to impose upon her.

The coming-of-age film also stars Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Lil Yachty, Mike Epps, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Justin Martin, Titus Makin, Michael Cooper Jr., GaTa, Sanaa Lathan and Cliff ‘Method Man’ Smith.

‘We are thrilled to bring a truly inspiring film about fighting for your dreams to the service this fall,’ said Tanya Giles, chief programming officer at Paramount+. ‘_On the Come Up_ is a moving love letter to hip hop and an entertaining film for all ages.’

Produced by Temple Hill and State Street Pictures, _On the Come Up_ is directed by Sanaa Lathan, with screenplay by Kay Oyegun. The film is produced by George Tillman Jr., Robert Teitel, Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, Isaac Klausner, Angie Thomas and Timothy M. Bourne and executive produced by John Fischer.
