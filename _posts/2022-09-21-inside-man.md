Everyone’s a murderer… you just need a good reason and a bad day.

_Inside Man_ is a major new thriller from BAFTA and Emmy award-winning writer Steven Moffat. This captivating four-part mini-series follows a prisoner on death row in the United States (Stanley Tucci), a Vicar in a sleepy English town (David Tennant) and a maths teacher trapped inside a cellar (Dolly Wells). Watch as their lives cross paths in the most unexpected of ways…

_Inside Man_ is coming to BBC One and BBC iPlayer on 26  September at 9pm.

Led by David Tennant (_Des, Doctor Who),_ this star-studded cast also features Dolly Wells (_The Pursuit of Love, Dracula),_ Lyndsey Marshal (_Dracula, Hanna)_, and Lydia West (_It’s a Sin)_ with Stanley Tucci (_Feud, The Hunger Games)_ in the titular role as the Inside Man.
