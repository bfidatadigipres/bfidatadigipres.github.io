**Panellists: Commissioners Caroline Thomson, Paul Bonner, Peter Ansorge, Karin Bamborough, John Ranelagh and Farrukh Dhondy**

Members of the original Channel 4 Commissioning team come together to explain what was so different about this new broadcaster. What were their priorities? How did they achieve these extraordinarily original programmes? And what did the remit to ‘innovate in the form and content of programmes’ and ‘to reach new audiences not catered for currently by British television’ mean to them? Significant aspects of people’s lives, political opinion, thought and creativity, style and culture were simply untouched by British television in the 1970s. This new channel was determined to give them space, with some of its bravest programming, during its first decade.

**Channel 4: the First Ten Years**  
The first years of Channel 4 were an exhilarating period for anyone involved. The excitement and optimism of changing television carried everyone along – ‘the remit’ was an explicit rationale to experiment in the form and content of programmes, push the boundaries and to challenge the mainstream by introducing a wider range of distinctive alternative programmes. In many areas Channel 4 introduced a radical diversity – new forms and genres of television, creating spaces where different ideas could meet their audiences.

This short season at the BFI Southbank is planned to celebrate the innovations and principles of early Channel 4, some of which may be relevant again at a time of change as television enters an entirely new digital terrain. A panel discussing Channel 4: The Television Revolution may be the relevant place to offer some elements of the overall intention and rationale for the season.

It was first conceived in 2019, but delayed as the extensive digitisation at the BFI archive and then the pandemic took place. Following the digitisation a large proportion of the Channel’s output is now viewable at the BFI Mediatheque and supplements the season.

With Channel 4 transmitting 3000 hours each year the selection for the BFI season of about 20 hours from some 30,000 hours overall was an extremely difficult if not impossible task. Also the cinematic venue and audiences of the BFI Southbank naturally led to an emphasis on showing substantial pieces of ground breaking programme making that inevitably left out whole genres – sport and current affairs, animation and experiment for example – and important elements of the schedule like _Channel Four News_ and _Brookside_. However, we hope that in stripping the content across some 9 themed screenings and events we have been able to so some justice to the channel’s remarkable output both then and now.

It is clear that this is an epoch where linear television is being replaced, certainly for younger generations, by access to streamers and digital resources. Commercial contexts determine commissioning decisions and algorithms curate our viewing choices. The notion that television with a market-led approach fulfils audience needs has always been a highly contested one. It is defended by its supporters as democratic, and by its detractors as a self-fulfilling prophecy which gradually closes down the space for public debate.

The various regional and national screenings and events celebrating the 40th anniversary of Channel 4 over the next few months indicate continued interest in the very different framework of that earlier epoch. However disinterring the early years of Channel 4 is not about nostalgia – the innovative principles of its past versions of public service television need to be re-invented and developed in a new epoch by all public service television including Channel 4 itself.

**About the panel**

**Caroline**  **Thomson** joined Channel 4 in 1984 as a Commissioning Editor – commissioning in current affairs and science. She went on to become the first Director of Corporate Affairs working to Michael Grade. In 1996 she became deputy Director of the BBC World Service and in 2000 was appointed Director of Policy at the BBC. She remained a member of the BBC executive, finally as Chief Operating Officer, until 2012. Subsequently she became Executive Director of the English National Ballet and has had a number of non-executive roles including deputy Chair of the National Gallery and Chair of Oxfam and of Digital UK which runs and develops the Freeview television platform.

**Paul Bonner** rose through the ranks of the BBC from Sound FX on the _Goon Show_ to Head of Science and Features. He played a leading role in the launch of Channel 4 as Channel Controller and was a key figure in the amalgamation of multiple ITV companies into a single entity. He is co-author of two volumes of _Independent Television in Britain_.

**Peter Ansorge** began his career in TV Drama at BBC Birmingham working as script editor and producer under David Rose. His productions there included _Gangsters_, David Hare’s _Licking Hitler_ and _Empire Road_. His later award-winning drama series commissions at Channel 4 include _A Very British_ _Coup_, _Traffik_, _GBH_, _The Politician’s Wife_ and _Tales of the City_. He currently teaches the popular ‘Writing The TV Pilot’ course at the National Film & TV School which is sponsored by Sara Geater at All3 Media.

**Karin Bamborough** joined Channel 4 in 1981 as Commissioning Assistant for Fiction and Arts, became Commissioning Editor for Film on 4 and single drama, and finally co-deputy head of drama with Peter Ansorge. In 1991 she left Channel 4 to join the Norwegian State Broadcaster NRK as Controller of Drama. On returning to the UK she was an independent producer before becoming Head of Producing at the National Film & TV school, where she is still a senior tutor.

**John Ranelagh** began his television career as a Researcher on BBC TV’s _Midweek_ and was Associate Producer of _Ireland: A Television History_. He joined Channel 4 with Jeremy Isaacs and was Special Assistant to the Chief Executive, Secretary of the Board, and a Commissioning Editor. He developed the commissioning system, created the _Equinox_ strand, and was responsible for _Jesus: The Evidence_. He was the first television professional appointed to the Independent Television Commission.

**Farrukh Dhondy** worked as Commissioning Editor, Multicultural Programming, for Channel 4 between 1984 to 1997. In this capacity, he was responsible for hundreds of hours of TV in all genres: entertainment, situation, comedy, TV drama, film, education and factual, and helped greenlight iconic shows like _Desmond’s_ and _The Bandung File_.
