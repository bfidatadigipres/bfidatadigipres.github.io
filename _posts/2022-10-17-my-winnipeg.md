UK distribution for the films of the avant-garde Canadian director  Guy Maddin has been erratic, with only _The Twilight of the Ice Nymphs_ (1997), _Dracula Pages from a Virgin’s Diary_ (2002) and _The Saddest Music in the World_ (2003) earning fully fledged releases here. But even those not fluent in Maddinese will pick up in a flash the director’s stylistic lingo in _My Winnipeg_, a multilayered docu-fantasy that doubles as a nifty Maddin primer. As an onscreen surrogate dozes his way through a never-ending train journey, Maddin fantasises in his italicised, mock dramatic narration about how best to leave the place where he has spent his life. ‘What if I film my way out of here?’ he wonders, introducing the idea of cinema as psychological liberation, before trying to work through Winnipeg’s history and his own, the better to shake it off at last.

In the film’s dizziest, most Charlie Kaufmanesque sections, Maddin moves into his childhood home where he stages key moments from his youth using actors as his three siblings (one of whom died aged 16). Ann Savage, scarcely seen since playing the vinegary femme fatale in Edgar G. Ulmer’s 1945 _Detour_, takes the part of their fearsome matriarch. (‘Mother is in the moment!’ whoops Maddin hilariously when Savage comes up with the goods). With his childhood pet Toby the chihuahua, played by Spanky the pug, looking on, and a lump beneath the living room carpet representing Maddin’s exhumed father, this fake family re-enacts scenes which themselves reflect on the process of re-enactment – particularly the ritual of watching the TV serial ‘LedgeMan’, in which each episode sees the same highly strung young fellow poised to jump from the window ledge, only to be coaxed indoors by his mother in preparation for a repeat performance the following day. It’s a perfectly ripe metaphor for the soothingly repetitious hysteria of family life.

It would be unrealistic to expect conventional dramatic energy from a film this skittish and freeform, which takes in everything from Winnipeg workers’ riots to a medium who interprets her messages from the dead in dance. That said, there’s quite a kick to the performance of the aptly named Savage. ‘No matter where I am, I can feel her watching me,’ complains Maddin, as back-projected footage of her scowling face appears magnified in train windows and she assumes the infantilising omnipresence of the mother in Woody Allen’s _Oedipus Wrecks_ (from the _New York Stories_ portmanteau).

Allen’s _Manhattan_ is also a clear precursor of _My Winnipeg_, as are city-based film essays like _London_ or _Tokyo-Ga_, and especially _True Stories_, the spaced-out hymn to everyday eccentricity directed by David Byrne of Talking Heads. As with Byrne, Maddin’s most skew-whiff ideas – such as the frozen horses sunken in a snow-covered field ‘like 11 knights on a great white chessboard’ – assume a poignancy that outlasts their silliness. Scattershot it might be, but  _My Winnipeg_ nudges at the heart of what it means to dream, and how our fantasies of who we are spring from the reality of where we are.

This is articulated most sharply in the revelation of an alternative web of back lanes, known as ‘black arteries’, that don’t appear on any map of Winnipeg – ‘lanes with names known only by word-of-mouth – illicit things, best not discussed.’ There’s an entire tantalising mythology for this secret network, but its real value lies in contributing another layer to Maddin’s wildly fabricated Winnipeg, where veracity matters less than evocation. Who cares if, as Maddin claims, Winnipeg really has ten times the sleepwalking rate of any city in the world? What counts is that the cap fits.

The level of invention in Maddin’s writing is so high that there are times when the film’s visual style, for all its busyness, lags behind noticeably. The textural collage is appropriately jumbled and hallucinatory: the editing is so frenetic that many shots register only subliminally, while dissolves make the images bleed together into abstract shadows and smudges during a spooky tour of three vertically stacked swimming pools. Noirish monochrome puts up a good fight against colour inserts and burnished shadow puppetry, but this is still a film that rewards the ears more than the eyes. It’s no new thing for audiences to be coerced into buying the soundtrack of a film they’ve just seen. On this occasion, I’m hoping there’ll be an audiobook.

**Guy Maddin on ‘My Winnipeg’**  
I firmly believe that _My Winnipeg_ is a documentary, but in a pre-emptive strike against tiresome arguments I just call it a ‘docu-fantasia’ and that seems to at least limn out a sub-genre of documentary for itself. In addition to facts, it also presents a lot of opinions, nakedly and unashamedly so, and then it’s all presented dreamily. I made a shorter film with Isabella Rossellini to mark her father Roberto’s centennial (_My Dad Is 100 Years Old_, 2006) – I don’t think she did any research, and yet it’s full of rock-solid emotional truth. Emboldened by that and by precedents set in literature by W.G. Sebald, I went on a little Möbius-strip train trip through my home town.

_Every so often you get impassioned, particularly on the subject of the destruction of much-loved buildings._

I realised I was getting obsessionally vitriolic when the movie was screened to puzzled Berliners; I wondered how much empathy they might have for me when I’m griping about a couple of buildings and their entire city was pounded flat a generation ago. But I could hear in the silence of that Berlin audience a lot of poststructuralist eyebrow knitting going on.

_Was the title always_ My Winnipeg _?_

There was a civic pride slogan in the 1970s that I always loved because it sounded a little bit threatening: ‘Love me, love my Winnipeg.’ For the longest time I was calling it that, but its working title was always _My Winnipeg_, and when it came for me to change it to my preferred title, those associated with the project wouldn’t let me. Never ever have a working title.

**The Heart of the World**  
Maddin has said of his short, ‘to this day the only film that turned out as I planned it.’ This 4K restoration only heightens the sense of wonder produced by the filmmaker’s take on Soviet propaganda filmmaking.
