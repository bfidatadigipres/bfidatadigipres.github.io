**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
Experienced viewers of Peter Greenaway’s films, even if they are relatively familiar with architectural history, might have suspected or hoped that Etienne-Louis Boullée was a figment of the Greenaway imagination, and that the life and works so elaborately constructed by Stourley Kracklite were some amazing spoof with drawings by Greenaway’s own hand. They will be considerably disappointed to discover that Boullée not only existed but also penned a treatise on architecture which had some small impact at the end of the 18th century. His role in the film, therefore, is not to represent the teasing playfulness we have come to expect from this director, for this is a film about another draughtsman’s contract or the difficult relation of draughtsmen with their patrons (Kracklite with his; Boullée, few of whose plans were ever realised, with his). Boullée, child of the revolutionary era, believed in the moral and cultural vocation of architecture and, like most artists of his generation, viewed Rome as the hallowed source of creative inspiration. In Boullée’s case, however, it was Rome as seen through the fantastic imagination of Piranesi and, like the American professor in _Changing Places_, he was careful not to destroy the illusion by confrontation with the present reality of the object of his dreams.

The fascination of the eternal city is beautifully realised in a series of architectural and corporeal contrasts. On the one hand, there is the classical perfection of the Pantheon, with its dome and façade of pillars, a mausoleum for the illustrious which serves as a backdrop for Kracklite’s reception to Rome. On the other hand, the Victor Emmanuel monument, in which the Boullée exhibition is to be held, hitherto considered something of a white elephant in its neobaroque exuberance, also a mausoleum but here a graveyard of Kracklite’s dreams and the scene of his death. Finally, there are Boullée’s own designs, whose attraction perhaps is that they escape the dialectic of excess and restraint by being at once massive, geometric and unrealisable for the most part.

Boullée was clearly an architect who had meditated on the great pyramid and who was fascinated – as perhaps his project for a monument to Isaac Newton shows – by the mystical mathematics of construction. A similar set of paradoxes is embodied in the contrasting physical qualities of the protagonists and, in particular, the inspired casting of Caspasian and Kracklite. The lean and hungry Lambert Wilson, immaculate in his double-breasted suits and slicked-back hair is, paradoxically, the representative of the decadent and Machiavellian Old World with its drapery, rich colours and cynicism; while the too-generously proportioned Brian Dennehy, with his paunch, his messy beard and his propensity, in the Kracklite persona, to alcoholic excesses, comes from the New World of puritanism, naivety and inhibition. It is a pity that Kracklite’s wife Louisa, who serves as the link between these two extremes, is not more capable of embodying the contradiction within herself.

Like so many of Greenaway’s films, _The Belly of an Architect_ draws a number of circles round a number of questions without ever approaching them head on. Indeed, bits of the film are more like absent-minded doodles than elements germane to the narrative. For example, do men ever possess the same creative ability as women? Kracklite experiences what appears to be a phantom pregnancy with the same nine-month period of gestation as that of his wife. In the meantime, in his obsessive quest for an explanation, he perambulates Rome, inspecting the bellies of its emperors in the city’s profusion of statuary. In much the same way as the entrails of sacrificial beasts were supposed to augur well or ill for some momentous venture, so Kracklite collects images of these statues and magnifies the guts in the hope that some clue will emerge. In so doing, he perhaps produces a paradigm of Roman culture, with its combination of austerity and excess, its public virtue and private vice, summed up here in the image of Augustus and his modern descendant, Kracklite.

If one chooses to see _The Belly of an Architect_ as an Englishman’s exploration of the paradoxes of his culture, it is an extremely moving film. The Roman setting, the extraordinary beauty of Sacha Vierny’s photography, the richness of the colours, the fabrics and the stones, all the aesthetic indulgence that British or, for that matter, North American culture rejects, are beautifully deployed here in a context which brilliantly exposes both their fascination and the discomfort they engender. After all, as Kracklite learns from a doctor, many of these emperors came to very sticky ends. Where _The Belly of an Architect_ is less satisfactory is in its characterisation, or even its capacity to make us concerned with its characters whose antics, when not inadvertently comic, are banal. There are one or two genuinely amusing gags – the old man who fakes a heart attack to publicise the exhibition, the tramp who chops noses off statues – but these are relatively infrequent. However, in the context of the Greenaway _oeuvre_, _The Belly of an Architect_ appears to stand against the grids, taxonomies and lists that have become so familiar – all those previous attempts to marshal the world into some kind of visually representable order – so as to give room and expression to the emotions. Perhaps this is the film of Greenaway’s own mid-life crisis.
