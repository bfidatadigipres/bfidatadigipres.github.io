Join us for a panel discussion exploring our Peter Greenaway season and his career as director, film philosopher and visual artist. Chaired by season programmer Justin Johnson, this season introduction will be richly illustrated with clips guiding you through the selection of films screening, while a panel of experts will offer different perspectives on Greenaway’s work.  

**Speakers**  

**Lavinia Brydon** is a senior lecturer in film at the University of Kent, United Kingdom. Her interests centre on the issues of place in film and the wider arts. She has published on these interests in various journals including _Film Studies, Leisure/Loisir_ and _Journal of British Cinema and Television_. She also serves on the editorial board of the journal Short Film Studies.

**William Fowler** is Curator of Artists’ Moving Image at the BFI National Archive where he acquires, restores and curates films. His projects have included Queer Pagan Punk: Derek Jarman, the biggest ever UK retrospective of Jarman’s films, and This Is Now: Film and Video After Punk which toured internationally in collaboration with artist moving image agency LUX. He is co-author of _The Bodies Beneath: The Flipside of British Film and Television_ published by Strange Attractor Press in 2019.

**Victor Fraga** is an Anglo-Brazilian journalist, filmmaker and exhibitor. Born in Brazil and based in London for 25 years, he is the founder and director of DMovies (aka Dirty Movies), the portal for thought-provoking cinema, one of the leading indie film publications in the UK since 2016. He has recently directed two films, _The Coup d'Etat Factory_ and _The Flour Test_, showcased in festivals and cinemas on both sides of the Atlantic. Victor believes that cinema is a powerful transformational tool on a personal, social and also political level. This vision is reflected on DMovies and his films. Victor is also a film exhibitor: he organises screenings and events across the British capital, also through DMovies. In 2020, Victor interviewed Peter Greenaway for three hours as part of a tribute for _Doesn't Exist_ magazine.

**Daniel Graham** worked in film distribution and film journalism for several years, interviewing directors such as Claire Denis, Theo Angelopoulos, Ousmane Sembène, Alexander Sokurov, Béla Tarr, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Aki Kaurismäki, Mia Hansen-Løve and Lucile Hadžihalilović.

He wrote and directed his feature film debut in 2016, _Opus Zero_, an independent art house movie shot in Mexico with Willem Dafoe and Andrés Almeida. In 2019, Graham completed his second film _The Obscure Life of the Grand Duke of Corsica_, starring Timothy Spall and Peter Stormare, about a straight-talking architect who builds a mausoleum for a dying billionaire. More recently, Graham completed the 19th century boxing film _Prizefighter: The Life of Jem Belcher_ with Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe, Ray Winstone, Màrton Csokas, Jodhi May and Steven Berkoff.

He is currently developing _Wagner In Venice_, a fictionalised account of the composer’s final months in Venice in 1882.

**Chair: Justin Johnson** is the BFI’s Lead Programmer for BFI Southbank and also selects films for the BFI London Film Festival. He is a regular contributor to radio and TV on matters concerning films and animation and has produced films for Atticus Films. He has served on juries at many European Film Festivals including Berlin, Copenhagen and Zlin and has served as both a selector and a juror for the British Animation Awards. Justin has been a member of the BAFTA Film Committee and Deputy Chair of the BAFTA Children’s Committee as well as chairing professional juries for different award categories and for the Royal Television Society. Justin has programmed recent BFI seasons including Ennio Morricone, Bette Davis, Anime, Mike Hodges, Glenda Jackson, Mike Leigh and Sergio Leone.
