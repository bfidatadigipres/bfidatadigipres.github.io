An uncompromisingly frank portrait of a particular sector of working-class family life in south-east London (where Gary Oldman grew up), _Nil by Mouth_ is a powerful, astute, authentically foul-mouthed account of unfettered machismo, booze and drugs, petty crime and domestic abuse. The performances are excellent throughout, especially those of Ray Winstone as the volatile but self-pitying Ray, Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife Val and Charlie Creed-Miles as her junkie brother Billy. Shot and scripted in a deceptively casual realist style reminiscent of 70s Cassavetes, this profoundly personal and humane film eschews sensationalism and sentimentality to illuminate a vicious circle of abuse and criminality. A dark but dazzling masterwork.  
**Geoff Andrew, Programmer-at-large**

There is a moment in Gary Oldman’s directorial debut _Nil by Mouth_ which for me shattered all critical distance. It’s not the event on which the film hinges – when the protagonist Ray, a thief and a thug, viciously assaults his wife Valerie – but just before this, when he stands in his underpants screaming hate into her face. A shock of recognition took me back to the living room of my own childhood, to another atmosphere thick with fear and spittle. I mention this not out of a sense of solidarity with other children of enraged parents nor a solipsistic need to personalise the film, but because it’s the kind of cathartic identification with real lives that _Nil by Mouth_ goes out of its way to achieve.

The narrative of _Nil by Mouth_ is fairly erratic. It follows Ray and his family into a tailspin of abuse and self-abuse. Ray has a prodigious drink and drugs intake; Valerie’s younger brother Billy, who works for Ray on and off, is a South London street junkie. Sometimes we follow Billy’s lonely quest for identity and substances, but mostly we witness the seething discord between Valerie’s family and Ray. When Billy steals some of Ray’s drugs, Ray attacks him, biting deep into his nose. This is a typically brutal event in a film that’s unapologetic about its gruelling subject matter. It’s later on, however, when Ray finds the pregnant Valerie playing pool in the pub with a stranger, that the viciousness builds to a horrible peak.

But for me, all the drugs, violence and criminality are as nothing compared with the moment when the family cataclysm has not come but seems inevitable. When I watched this autobiographically inspired film, I assumed that Oldman’s father must have been violent towards his spouse. When I later found out he was not, the personal chiming made more sense to me. My own father never struck out either, but I can vividly recall the expectation that he was about to.  I would not have pondered my own experience this way if _Nil by Mouth_ had not felt so compellingly authentic. I don’t mean authentic in the manner of precise period evocation, or even in the grimly determinate mode of British kitchen sink realism, but in the sense of it being an experience of believable life in the cinema. Because as much as _Nil by Mouth_ looks and sounds like South London, it also looks and sounds like a large-scale movie.

‘Authentic’ and ‘believable’ are of course terms whose meaning has been shredded in the post-modern era. But what I’m suggesting here is that this film marks a change in the quality of British realist cinema, one which recognises an audience’s need for their experiences to find their equivalent on screen.  In several ways _Nil by Mouth_ seems to me significantly different from what we’ve come to expect from British realist cinema. Like many British movies financed by television over the last decade or so, Oldman’s film has a preponderance of close-ups of people in confined spaces, yet they are lit and lensed in such a way that it never feels less than a cinema experience. There’s a burnish and sweep to the image-making similar to what we’ve come to expect from such ex-pat directors in Hollywood as Tony and Ridley Scott and Adrian Lyne. They also like to get close with a telephoto lens, giving that paradoxical combination of intimacy and distance. As in the best films of his friend and executive producer Luc Besson, Oldman has borrowed the strongest aspects of American cinema for his own entirely different purposes. In a similar fashion, his script harnesses fruity anecdotes and the rhythms of London street talk in such a way that his dialogue rivals the best of American screenwriting in combining believability and pleasure.

But the more significant change is in _Nil by Mouth_’s attitude to the people it depicts, the sense that Oldman’s is a personal cinema drawn from his own experience as a youth in Deptford – a film that in the romantic sense he simply had to make. Whatever the considerable virtues of Ken Loach’s _Raining Stones,_ say, or Mike Leigh’s _Naked,_ they often maintain, in their desire to show social structures at work, a political distance from their characters. Oldman’s film moves in so close that the viewer feels absolutely confined with the hellish family depicted.

I’m not suggesting that the mediation is somehow invisible, only that Brechtian distanciation is here supplanted by an intimate relationship to the film subject, one born from psychotherapeutic models. As explained by production designer Hugo Luczyc-Wyhowski, _Nil by Mouth_ follows a show-and-tell approach from the work of Cassavetes and from such television cop shows as _Homicide:_ _Life on the Street,_ but this is fused with the British realist tradition, particularly as exemplified in the work of Alan Clarke (_Made in Britain, The Firm_). It’s a brand of realism that in a way acknowledges that British audiences are now more ‘in touch with their emotions’. If Oldman’s were the only film around by a British director to be so concerned with physical and emotional intimacy, it would pass as an anomaly, but there are others that are equally direct, such as Mike Figgis’ _One Night Stand_ and Carine Adler’s _Under the Skin_ [to which I must own a connection: I live with the producer], a study of grieving young women on a sexual binge. Of course there are many other kinds of British film being made at the moment, but _Nil by Mouth_ supplies a fresh antidote to the current Hollywood output of event movies, without setting itself in opposition to all American cinema.
