_The Saddest Music in the World_ is set in Winnipeg during the Great Depression of 1933. Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), a once successful Broadway impresario now on the skids, arrives back in his home town with his amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) in tow, and plunges straight into a maelstrom of difficult family reunions and encounters with his now legless ex-lover Lady Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) – a queenly beer magnate who’s running an international contest to find the ‘saddest music in the world’. Chester and his father were both implicated in the accident that led to Lady Port-Huntley’s double amputation (her legs have been replaced by glass ones filled with brew).

According to the director, ‘There was no pressure to conform to commercial acceptability; we Canadians don’t have the strongest grasp of what that is anyway. There was some concern among my Canadian distributors when they found out a week before shooting that the film was in black and white. They’d assumed it was in colour; I’d assumed a film about the Depression was to be monochrome. To avoid marital arbitration I was happy to throw some colour into the funeral scenes and a dream. I had these paint chips kicking around anyway and was dying to try out some combinations.’

About a third of the film is shot in narrow-gauge, ultra-grainy Super 8. ‘Luckily, when you shoot in remote Winnipeg, almost no one comes to see you at work. But my producers always endorsed my Super 8 photography. One of them, Jody Shapiro, is one of the best photographers I know. He was always grabbing one of these hornet-sized toys and buzzing away – he has some of the best shots in the movie. We wore out a platoon of these eBay purchases – they’re just not used to the amount of work we made them do or to the low temperatures.’

The key themes of _The Saddest Music in the World_ are evoked by the title: grief, music and cultural conflict. These elements are delivered via a Eurovision-style ‘cavalcade of misery’, sponsored by Port-Huntley. Competing to come up with the saddest music in the world, contestants square off in two opposing teams, armed with a range of instrumental exotica from Siamese flutes to Scottish bagpipes via sitars and accordions, with the victors sliding into a giant vat of beer to celebrate.

Appropriately, this multicultural medley sprang from Anglo-Japanese and Canadian-Icelandic minds. Kazuo Ishiguro’s original screenplay, written a decade earlier (placing it between 1989’s elegiac _The Remains of the Day_ and 1995’s darkly dreamlike _The Unconsoled_, novels suffused with wistful melancholy), was set in late-1980s London, after perestroika opened Eastern Europe up to western capitalism. Adapting it, Guy Maddin and regular co-writer George Toles turned the clock back to Depression-era 1933 and the location to their native Winnipeg, whose Muskeg brewery is itching to flood America with beer come Prohibition’s repeal.

Typically with Maddin, the formal approach evokes the period setting. Aesthetically, the film resembles an early talkie, its visual texture recalling a grainy, much-abused print. The film is mostly in black and white, with garish interludes mimicking early experimental colour processes. The sound pops and crackles, occasionally lapsing into disconcerting silence. While rejecting accusations that he’s a mere _pasticheur_, Maddin resurrects long-abandoned film forms, stirring into the mix with admirably straight-faced conviction German expressionist lighting, Soviet montage, ‘golden age’ Hollywood melodramatics and Busby Berkeley’s more fetishistic choreography.

Although Maddin’s eccentric sensibility is much in evidence (who else would reinvent ‘Skip to My Lou’ as a funeral dirge?), _Saddest Music_ advances on _Tales from the Gimli Hospital_ (1988), _Archangel_ (1990), _Careful_ (1992) and the disappointing _Twilight of the Ice Nymphs_ (1997) for two main reasons. Not only does it tap into a genuinely melancholic seam beneath the surface eye-catching weirdness, it also aims a neatly satirical sideswipe at Canada’s  largest neighbour.

The various competing nations are convincingly heartrending, but all are systematically picked off by the US, represented by failed Broadway producer Chester Kent, a spats-sporting, slippery-haired sleazeball given a nuanced portrayal by Mark McKinney. Becoming a finalist not through sincerity but by bribing losing contestants to join his increasingly elaborate stage confections which transform real-life disasters into grotesquely upbeat song-and-dance numbers, Chester seeks to convey ‘sadness, but with sass and pizzazz’.  The climactic ‘Alaskan Kayak Tragedy of 1898’ routine comprehensively skewers any pretensions towards genuine sorrow as Lady Port-Huntley triumphantly reveals her beer-filled glass legs.

If Chester lacks a heart, brother Roderick has one too many: he carries his dead son’s organ in a jar filled with his own tears, and is hypersensitive to a point where physical contact and inappropriate sounds make him shriek in agony (shades of Glenn Gould?). His former wife Narcissa blocks these memories through psychosomatic amnesia and an imaginary talking tapeworm, each absolving her of personal responsibility. Meanwhile, his father Fyodor is haunted by his wife’s death, his Great War memories and his botched amputation attempt on Lady Port-Huntley, who also has ample cause for lamentation. They truly understand sadness, at a level Chester only appreciates when confronted by his own imminent demise.

Original, often hilarious, _The Saddest Music in the World_ hails from a parallel universe whose technologically backward film culture is more than compensated by its sparkling creative vim. If there’s any justice, Isabella Rossellini’s involvement (in her most distinctive role since Blue Velvet’s  Dorothy Vallens) will make it Maddin’s most accessible film.
