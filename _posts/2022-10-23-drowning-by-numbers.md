**A contemporary review**  
Peter Greenaway has become his own foremost exegete, although it is not yet clear whether this career move springs from a frustration that most English critics have little taste for decoding the intricacies of his plotting or merely from a wish to add a further level of absurdity to those already ingrained in his films. _Drowning by Numbers_ arrives accompanied by a twenty-six-minute TV trailer, entitled _Fear of Drowning_, in which Greenaway the deadpan critic offers a faintly amused analysis of the structures, patterns and motifs in the feature itself: the endless sets of three (three Cissies, three drownings, three rebuffed seductions, three communal games), the number count from 1 to 100, the derivation of character names from the ‘famous last words’ of assorted luminaries, the painterly roots of certain key images, and so on. Its strengths as inspired, state-of-the-art promotion for the release of the film aside, this exegesis turns out to be almost entirely superfluous, since the film itself carefully foregrounds its own mechanisms and devices: no Greenaway film since _The Falls_ has laid its organising principles so bare.

_Drowning by Numbers_ rests on the same absurdist premises as Greenaway’s other work, but it is all but devoid of the poetic mysteries and ambiguities that have sometimes suggested a secret kinship between Greenaway and Raul Ruiz as latter-day surrealists. This is a film of remorseless, Cartesian logic, in which every motive is open for inspection and every conflict can be reduced to the terms of a tug-of-war. If Greenaway’s narrative features have represented a gradual etiolation of narrative, from the density of  _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ (where the release version was a digest of a film originally much longer) to the inconsequential off-screen chicaneries of _The Belly of an Architect_, then _Drowning by Numbers_ represents the point where the minimal exigencies of storytelling blur into the ‘purer’, non-narrative structures of earlier films like _Vertical Features Remake_ and _The Falls_ – the very films, as it happens, in which Cissie Colpitts got her first name checks.

Greenaway himself cheerfully describes the film as a sardonic morality play: ‘_Drowning by Numbers_ is a black and comic fairy-tale for adults, half invented by children who are innocently obsessed with sex and death – especially death. It is a poetic, amoral tale told morally to support the belief that the good are seldom rewarded, the bad go largely unpunished and the innocent are always abused’. This makes it sound like the ironic and effetely intellectual English counterpart to an ebullient Russ Meyer sex film, and it’s true that Greenaway’s schema of strongwilled women, unprepossessing men, marital strife and sexualised landscapes shares quite a few underlying assumptions with Meyer’s parodies of Thornton Wilder. But Greenaway’s left-liberal proclivities generate a ‘world’ without any of the moral certainties that Meyer so gleefully deflates, and _Drowning by Numbers_ is finally serenely indifferent to its characters’ moral plusses and minuses. If the film’s post-Darwinian view of female ruthlessness and male helplessness can be said to have a ‘moral’ thrust at all, then it is simply the flipside of the amoral, voyeuristic pleasures of Greenaway’s TV short _Making a Splash_, which showed people of all ages and genders ‘at home’ in water: a bleak, existential vision in which the only ‘moral’ poles are those labelled ‘swimming’ and ‘drowning’. And since this is Greenaway’s most Beaubourg-esque film, the one whose inner workings are most self-consciously displayed on its surface, it follows that it produces the most nakedly explicit images to illustrate those poles, from the flaccid penises of the drowning men to the inviolable confederation of Cissies, by way of Smut’s twin desires to virilise death and devirilise himself.

The effectiveness or otherwise of Greenaway’s work _as cinema_ seems to owe more than is commonly recognised to his collaborations with actors. The performances in Greenaway films are often written off as mere adjuncts to the general patterns of symmetry and asymmetry, but the Olympian detachment that hovers around Greenaway’s grand designs is frequently offset by actors who contrive to ‘humanise’ characters written as little more than mouthpieces for attitudes and epigrams. The emotional nullity of _A Zed and Two Noughts_ (ostensibly a film about grief and coming to terms with inevitable decay) was partly attributable to the film’s pride in its own artifices, but also partly to the director’s and actors’ failures to generate palpable feelings of loss. Equally, the wallowing male self-pity of _The Belly of an Architect_ (which agonises over the essential sterility of male creativity: the phantom ‘pregnancy’ that turns out to be a malignant tumour) never succeeds in maximising the emotional weight of Brian Dennehy’s heroic performance because the director is unable or unwilling to make more of Chloe Webb’s Louisa Kracklite than a cypher for mockingly natural fecundity-a cypher, moreover, who isn’t even allowed her own close-ups.

By contrast, _Drowning by Numbers_ finds Greenaway back at work with English actors for the first time since _The Draughtsman’s Contract_, and slipping easily into a ‘theatrical’ idiom in which both the director and his players seem comfortable. Hence the potency of Cissie 1’s summary of the reasons for drowning her husband, the charm of Madgett’s scout-masterish enthusiasm for impossible games, the acid cruelty of the sexual oneupmanship games between Cissie 3 and Bellamy. The sheer presence of actors like Joan Plowright, Bernard Hill and Joely Richardson adds flesh to the bones of Greenaway’s caricatures, creating moments of depth in scenes that pull all the right emotional triggers. Of course, Greenaway the iconoclast also delights in outraging the good manners of the theatrical tradition on which these ‘human’ vignettes depend. Just as one never expected to see a veteran character actor like Bryan Pringle playing a nude sex scene, so it comes as a mild shock to find Joan Plowright drowning him in a sordid tin bath. There is an element in Greenaway that is close to Joe Orton.

In the accompanying article [see _Monthly Film Bulletin,_ October 1988], Thomas Elsaesser argues for seeing Greenaway’s work in a wider context than the normal auteurist perspective, which inevitably reduces judgments to subjective likes and dislikes. It is, indeed, both possible and desirable to relate Greenaway’s films to other work in contemporary cinema and theatre, but it is also impossible to avoid the insistently self-referential quality that permeates everything he does. His close collaborations with Michael Nyman (here developing variations on Mozart that he began in _The Falls_), his on-going partnership with Sacha Vierny in the quest for transcendentally surreal images, the pointless and endless elaboration of the ‘Greenaway mythology’ – these are all the essential signs of work that aggressively defines itself as _sui generis_. Just as much as Terence Davies, Derek Jarman or Phil Mulloy, Greenaway works in isolation and tries to turn his antipathy towards mainstream British culture into a strength. As long as this situation obtains, Greenaway dooms himself to constructing weird mixtures of theatricalised passion and avant-garde film poetry, mixtures that can only be sold under the brand name ‘Greenaway’. As such mixtures go, _Drowning by Numbers_ is his most considerable entertainment for some time: an autumnal pleasure dome, with caves of ice.
