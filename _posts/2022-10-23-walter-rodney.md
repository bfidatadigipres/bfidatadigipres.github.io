_We are really pleased to announce that joining the discussion will be  Dr Patricia Rodney (CEO of The Walter Rodney Foundation, academic and author), Gina Nadira Miller (activist politician and businesswoman), Lavinya Stennett (founder of Black Curriculum), Arlen Harris and Daniyal Harris-Vajda (directors). The discussion will be chaired by David Dabydeen (broadcaster, novelist, poet and academic, UNESCO Exec Board)._

This documentary explores the life of historian and civil rights campaigner  Dr Walter Rodney. Filmed in Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica, Tanzania, the US and the UK, featuring revelatory interviews, it examines the life of a man who sought unity in the face of division and whose ideals lie at the heart of global struggles today. Walter Rodney was killed in 1980 in Guyana, South America by the CIA and MI5-supported autocratic government of Forbes Burnham. Forty-one years after his death, the Guyanese government has finally acknowledged the state’s role in his assassination.

Supported by The Walter Rodney Foundation and the Ameena Gafoor Institute.

He has filmed with pirates in the South China seas, in Beirut and in Sri Lanka during the civil war. Arlen interviewed Fela Kuti, the king of Afro-Jazz and was probably the last foreign journalist to talk to Sikh militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale before the Indian Army attacked the militants in the Golden Temple.

**Daniyal Harris-Vajda** (Shooting Director / Editor): Ever since childhood Daniyal has wanted to tell stories through images, whether fact or fiction, to examine ideas and provoke reflection.

In the last two years working as an Assistant Producer, Cameraman and Editor at Noah Media Group, documentaries he worked on have been shown on ITV, Netflix, France’s Canal Plus and had a cinematic release _Arsene Wenger: Invincible_. _South of the River_, about why South London is producing so much football talent in the face of 12 years of austerity, has been nominated for best TV series at the Broadcast Sports Awards 2022. He has shot, edited and directed for broadcast, online content, drama and factual across the globe and is particularly interested in telling stories that help create positive change.

Since 2010 Gina has been spearheading the True and Fair Campaign, calling out rip-off behaviour in the UK financial services sector, calling for the overhaul of the FCA, and increasing governance and consumer protection within the financial services sector. Her work has included drafting text included in three EU Directives (Article 24 of MiFID II, PRIPS and The Shareholder Directive) that improved the outcomes for investors across the EU. Gina became a household name in 2017 after taking the UK Government to the Supreme Court over triggering Article 50, and again in 2019 over the illegal prorogation of Parliament. She won both cases in the Supreme Court securing the most historic constitutional victories for hundreds of years.
