_+ panel and Q&A with creator/writer Steven Knight, cast members  Connor Swindells and Alfie Allen, Director Tom Shankland and  Exec Producer Karen Wilson._

Filmed on location in the UK and Morocco, _SAS Rogue Heroes_ is the dramatised account of how the world’s greatest Special Forces unit, the SAS, was formed under extraordinary circumstances in the darkest days of  World War Two.

Steven Knight, _SAS Rogue Heroes_ writer and executive producer, says: ‘It has been a privilege to work on a project which tells the story of a renegade band of soldiers who used wit and imagination as much as firepower to halt the march of Fascism across North Africa during the darkest days of World War Two. This is a war story like no other, told in a way that is at once inspired by the facts and true to the spirit of this legendary brigade of misfits and adventurers.’

Rich with action and set-pieces, _SAS Rogue Heroes_ is the exhilarating story of renegade men taking monumental risks in extraordinary circumstances.

Cairo, 1941. David Stirling (Connor Swindells) – an eccentric young officer, hospitalised after a training exercise went wrong – is bored. Convinced that traditional commando units don’t work, he creates a radical plan that flies in the face of all accepted rules of modern warfare. He fights for permission to recruit the toughest, boldest and brightest soldiers for a small undercover unit that will create mayhem behind enemy lines. More rebels than soldiers, Stirling’s team are every bit as complicated, flawed and reckless as they are astonishingly brave and heroic.
