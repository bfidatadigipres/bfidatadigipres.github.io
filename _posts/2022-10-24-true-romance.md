**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Scripted by Quentin Tarantino, this is an unashamedly slick, brash, violent account of a spree embarked on by Detroit comic-store assistant Clarence (Slater) and novice sex-worker Alabama (Arquette) who suddenly find themselves in possession of the Mob’s cocaine. Of the starry supporting cast, (which also includes Samuel L Jackson, Brad Pitt and Val Kilmer), Oldman is memorably vivid as Alabama’s monstrous pimp.

**A contemporary review**  
The true romance on display here is between scriptwriter Quentin Tarantino and a litany of great B-movies. The film is as full of as many homages – or rip-offs, depending on how generous you are – as star cameos. Tarantino’s first completed script, written before _Reservoir Dogs_, is a manic tribute to the thing that he most loves, although it is not without a cheeky chiding of the more unscrupulous aspects of his home town. The mogul Donowitz, whose magnum opus is a Vietnam flick _Home in a Body Bag_, seems to have come from the same off-the-peg sleazy producer line as Steve Martin’s character in _Grand Canyon_.

The film has been touted by pundits as a _Badlands_ for the 90s, but that is to overlook the complicated pathos and poetry of Terrence Malick’s film. Or perhaps it’s those pundits’ short memories that can’t stretch back to all those other films about gun-crazy lovers on the run. This is the comic strip version of those films as distinct from the pulp version. ‘Pulp’ implies that there is an emotional bruising to be had, whereas this film is stripped down to bold graphics and crazy bursts of inspired dialogue – there’s no emotion. Emotion cannot be ironic, cannot be guarded by inverted commas. In _Badlands_, Sissy Spacek’s character may have invested too much in the _Teen Romance_ magazines with their Hollywood gossip and fluffy dreams, but Malick ensured that there was a bizarre wealth of feeling in those dime-store sentiments. Tarantino, however, trades in a currency of cleverness. His hero and heroine live and love in a movie frame. They even get the dream happy ending – complete with sunset – that would have never been allowed to their predecessors on the run to the Mexican borders. But their _True Romance_ does not require true emotion.

For if the film were about true emotion, then what would we make of its more dubious passions? The invective about ‘niggers’ in _Reservoir Dogs_ could be attributed to the pristine-suited sewer rats who spat the words out. It was scum dialogue for scummy men. The characters in _True Romance_ inhabit the same low-rent domain. But somehow there is a weary sense of _déjà vu_ as Clifford launches into his number about Sicilians being related to ‘niggers’ since they are ‘aubergine coloured’. This comes across as clever white-trash talk so loaded with irony as to mock those who are offended. But the bizarre and audacious cameo appearance of Gary Oldman as an African-American rasta certainly rankles, as does the sadistically prolonged fight between Alabama and Coccotti’s henchman. She may turn the tables on him, but not before incurring a sound and furious beating in a bathroom full of jagged glass.

Such routines are problematic and cannot be glibly dismissed (the Sicilian/nigger dialogue bas already been acclaimed as ‘brilliant’ by the critic Clancy Sigal). But the boyish outrage aspires to be forgiven with the quirky turns of the rest of the film. Brad Pitt as the spliffed-out space lieutenant Floyd, who sees Coccotti’s men less as the heavy mob than as a heavy trip, is truly funny. There are also the bravura rapid-fire conversational exchanges that allow characters to be pegged in one liners. This is Tarantino’s gift Tony Scott may be directing, but like a stick of rock, the film is shot through with Tarantino’s name. But what remains to be seen is whether his infatuation with film can mature into something a little more profound. With _True Romance_ it expresses itself as a frenzied affair, exciting at the time but easily forgotten.
