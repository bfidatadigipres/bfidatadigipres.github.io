_+ intro (on Sunday 30 October only)_

Perhaps even more unclassifiable than his debut _Hellraiser_, Clive Barker’s singular sophomore feature is an exhilarating action/horror hybrid about a secret kingdom of monsters (AKA the good guys), and the villainous humans who hunt them down, led by a crazed serial killer played by none other than David Cronenberg. Equal parts gorgeous and grotesque, _Nightbreed_ not only showcases Barker’s knack for ambitious world-building, but also serves as a queer-positive rallying cry for social reform.  
**Michael Blyth, bfi.org.uk**  

The _Nightbreed Director’s Cut_ is an entirely different film than the one which was released in theatres. It is 20 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, but it contains over 40 minutes of new and altered footage.

Clive oversaw the reconstruction and edit himself, personally ensuring that, at long last, he was able to tell the story he always wanted to tell, but until now, had never been given the chance. Once the scenes were reordered, and the original film footage restored, the entire film received a brand new sound mix and colour pass. It is, in every way, a different movie. It contains more story, more monsters, and there’s even a musical number. Ultimately, what we’ve delivered is a love story 25 years in the making.  
**Production notes**  

**Clive Barker talks to Mark Kermode about time-twisting, shape-shifting and stirring the primal soup**  
_Nightbreed_ is an inversion of what we normally think of monsters doing in monster movies, which is being the villains and the personification of evil and chaos. It also attempts to bring in some seemingly inappropriate imagery. One of the things I get most mail about regarding _Hellraiser_ is the fact that Frank says ‘Jesus wept!’ just before he is pulled apart at the seams. When I went to Danny Elfman to score _Nightbreed_, I said let’s go to Biblical epics, and that brought in something which could be deemed inappropriate to the genre. But the story is in fact very clearly a ‘Moses and the Lost Tribe’ tale. So there are inversions and wilful mismatchings at work.

Then there’s something which has won me few friends on _Nightbreed_, which is a kind of experimental, scatter-shot structure. Most movie narratives are very linear and follow one character-that’s particularly true of horror movies. I wanted to see what would happen if you actually gave a whole group of elements free reign. One American review said the film played like a series of trailers, and that’s actually not so wrong. It makes it fun to watch, but it also means that at the end it’s really very difficult to sum up and assess what you’ve seen. Many of the movies to which I looked as models, such as Fellini’s _Satyricon_, have that quality. It’s as if you go through the movie like a pinball, knocked from one series of references to another, each of which is obliquely referring to the central theme of inversion.

It’s very difficult to feel anything for any of the characters, and that again is deliberate. Each of the characters has an archetypal place, they’re even dressed archetypally: Lylesberg is the monk; Peloquin is the pirate monster; Boone is dressed in jeans, leather jacket and white T-shirt, and so on. There are also lots of jokes in the names – there is a character called Narcisse, for example, who ends up with only his face left on. Boone is the gift, Midian appears in the Bible as a place full of devils, but also in a weird way is full of angels.

The strengths and failings of my written work are probably the strengths and failings of my movie-making. There is always the obsessive preoccupation with telling the other side of a story, and legitimising the vision of the dark side, which is very important in _Nightbreed_, as is the sexual element, which was one of the more controversial elements of my short fiction. So there is that continuity from the written work and also from my drawings.
