_+ intro and discussion._

Terror strikes an Ontario town after an aural virus infects its inhabitants, with radio announcer Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) the last line of defence against the zombie hordes. Bruce McDonald’s terrifying horror offers a new twist on the zombie formula by exploring the nightmarish qualities of language and the dangers of uncontrolled repetition.

Selected and hosted by Ethan Lyon, co-host of the Autism Through Cinema podcast.

**RELAXED SERIES:**
**IN DREAMS ARE MONSTERS**<br>

Our In Dreams Are Monsters relaxed series will focus on two films that explore the limits of the human experience and the experience of living with autism. The absolute edge of consciousness provoked by overstimulation and the effect it has on the mind and body, especially the autistic mind and body, will be our focus for this short series.

Whether it’s the threat of your body morphing without your control or the nightmare of being locked in repetitious speech through an aural virus, both _The Fly_ and _Pontypool_ feature characters who are forced to re-evaluate their relationships with their own bodies when they encounter technology that threatens their sense of self.

After each screening join us for a relaxed discussion in the Blue Room as we unpack what makes these threats so chilling and how we can understand something of what it means to be autistic through these films.

Screenings selected from our In Dreams Are Monsters season by Ethan Lyon, a doctoral student at the University of Southampton and a co-host of the Autism Through Cinema podcast. His research focuses on fostering understanding around the lived experience of autism through gothic horror cinema from the 1930s to the 1960s.
