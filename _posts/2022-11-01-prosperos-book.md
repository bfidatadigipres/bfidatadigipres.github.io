_Prospero’s Books_ is a version of Shakespeare’s _The Tempest_ starring John Gielgud. Shakespeare’s play centres on Prospero, Duke of Milan, who has been deposed by his brother, Antonio, supported by Alonso, King of Naples, and now lives on an island with his daughter, Miranda. Opening with a storm in which the corrupt brother and his courtiers are shipwrecked on the island through Prospero’s magic. _The Tempest_ shows Prospero’s staging of an action in which he intends to take his revenge on his usurping brother.

Initially approached by Gielgud, who has cherished the idea of putting the enigmatic drama on screen for some time, Greenaway rapidly transformed the play into his own idiosyncratic vision. The film picks up on a brief mention in the text of 24 books from his library which Prospero is permitted to take into exile. These desert island volumes become an abstract counterpoint to the story, like the number count from one to 100 in _Drowning by Numbers_. While remaining faithful to Shakespeare’s text, Greenaway has put the words of all the characters into Prospero’s mouth for the first two-thirds of the film.

The results are fascinating, and sure to polarise viewers of Greenaway’s work even more than any of his previous films. 

**Peter Greenaway on ‘Prospero’s Books’**  
One of the reasons we have called the film _Prospero’s Books_ rather than _The Tempest_ is to indicate to an audience that it is not a straight attempt to reproduce a familiar text. One of my many interests was to pursue the 24 books that Gonzales, Prospero’s loyal courtier, supposedly put into the bottom of the leaky vessel in which Prospero was sent out into exile. That idea, I suppose, really holds the material together.

And it seemed quite logical from there to consider _The Tempest_ very much as a text, as something written. So what happened in the end is that I made the 24th book _The Tempest_ itself. So the whole film is structured around the idea of Shakespeare/Prospero (Gielgud) sitting in his cell on the island writing the play that you see.

The first word of the play is ‘Bosun’, which is a very interesting word because it is one that is never written down. It was used by seamen who were basically illiterate, so that when they came to write the word down it was ‘boat-swain’. It’s a nice opening point about the topsy-turvy use of oral and written language.

So the film opens with Gielgud sitting at his desk experimenting with the word ‘Bosun’, and you see it written up on the screen many times. The evocation of that word in conjunction with the first book of the film, which is the Book of Water, supposedly put together by Leonardo da Vinci, sets the film off. Right at the beginning, then, the audience knows we are at the origins of the play, and I make no attempt at straight illusionism.

At the end of the film the books are all destroyed. What happens, then, is that the apocryphal books – which of course never exist – are created in the first minute and destroyed in the last minute of a two-hour film. They are there only for the film, which I think is an intriguing idea.

_Following this so far? Good. Because it gets worse. In addition to the labyrinthine complexity of its narrative,_ Prospero’s Books _is visually the most dense of Greenaway’s films, thanks largely to the first extensive use of high definition television (HDTV) processes for the big screen. HDTV uses twice as many lines as conventional television to achieve better resolution, higher contrast and a wider range of colours. The resulting image – which also has a wide, cinema-like screen ratio – can be manipulated using all the sophisticated techniques of video editing: slow motion, superimposition, and animation._

_Shot on 35mm film,_ Prospero’s Books _is being edited using a combination of conventional film techniques and television post-production. Greenaway has edited three separate versions of the film which run in parallel and will ultimately be mixed together into a single two-hour narrative. He has spent a month in Japan using state-of-the-art HDTV editing facilities provided by the television company NHK. In order to test the potential of the technology, NHK contributed about £2 million worth of editing time free of charge (representing more than the entire production budget of about £1.5 minion)._

_The high definition techniques allow Greenaway to unite the sumptuous cinematography evident in_ The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover _with the sophisticated image manipulation of his television production of Dante’s_ Inferno_. Greenaway is wary of the film being seen as a ‘technological freak’, but believes he has only scratched the surface of the technical possibilities.

Working in conjunction with Tom Phillips on _A TV Dante_, there seemed to be a way through television to engender a whole series of new ways of making pictures, which I was much more familiar with in terms of painting and draughtsmanship than I was with cinema. It was an ability primarily to reorganise the screen ratio, to play with colour in a way you can’t in the cinema, and to extend and reshape the elements of the pictorial imagination, which you can do easily in painting. There was a time when I believed that the cinema had an ability to use all the letters of the alphabet and TV could only use the vowels. I don’t believe that to be the case any more; I think TV has its own vocabulary, its own alphabet. So what I wanted to do in _Prospero’s Books_ is to make the first tentative steps towards an expanded cinema which uses television vocabulary but still hangs on to the cinematic idea of creating images which are bigger, noisier, louder, more engulfing than you are.

It’s a terrible admission to make, but I do feel for me that cinema has somehow ceased to be a spectator sport. I get tremendous excitement out of making it rather than out of watching it. I suppose on another level it is like trying to regain those first days of the cinema when the audience rushed out because they thought that the waves coming in were going to wet their feet.

The play would certainly seem to start off as a revenge drama, with Prospero in the first five minutes ranting about his past and vowing revenge. But then two-thirds of the way through, almost without prior warning, the situation is broken open completely and there is a moment of truth when Prospero decides to forgive everybody. We have actually used this as a pivotal moment in the film, and for my purposes I am very happy with that sudden change of heart. But you must not be misled into thinking that this is psycho-drama. It is a drama of conceits and allegories and metaphors, and under these terms a sudden change of heart can no doubt be seen to be relevant to all the other concerns of the play.

There is a deliberate amalgamation or confusion between Shakespeare. Gielgud and Prospero – they are, in effect, the same person. It is Shakespeare’s last play, his farewell to illusionism, his farewell to playing games, his farewell to all this anti-naturalism. Gielgud at 87 is obviously near the end of his life, and he has had an incredibly long theatrical career. So in terms of English classical theatre, it is his goodbye to illusionism, to costumes, to dressing up, to playing games. And of course within the confines of the play itself this is exactly what Prospero does – in the famous last speech he actually turns to his audience and begs their forgiveness and abandons his magic before he leaves the stage.
