With his wife (Manville, then married to Oldman), child, comfortable home and job as an estate agent, Clive ‘Bexy’ Bissel (Oldman) would seem a respectable citizen; his abiding passion, however, is football hooliganism… Clarke’s TV drama, inspired by the rivalry between the ‘firms’ of violent hooligans of the 70s and 80s, centres on one of Oldman’s most forceful yet subtly persuasive performances.

_The Firm_ was to be Alan Clarke’s final film, though no-one involved in this very vigorous BBC production could have known as much during the shoot in the spring of 1988. Indeed, the film has enjoyed as healthy an afterlife as anything Clarke ever made. His onetime collaborator David Hare rates it ‘one of the few authentic television masterpieces.’ Phil Davis, who plays Yeti, is of the view that it ‘sums up the 1980s.’ Producer David M. Thompson wryly notes its achievement in having built ‘a certain hooligan cult following.’

The script – about a vicious turf war between self-styled ‘supporters’ of rival football teams who ruck with one another in the vicinity of their local stadiums – was by actor Al Hunter, who drew upon first-hand research. But according to cameraman John Ward, Clarke – a staunch fan of Everton FC – turned down Hunter’s offer of an introduction to the real firms who had inspired the drama: ‘Alan said, “No, I’m a football fan, they’re the guys who are ruining the game.”’ Clarke and Hunter were to have deeper disagreements. ‘Things were changed as drafts went on that were not always to Al’s liking,’ Phil Davis remembers. ‘But that was the thing about Alan, he shaped everything to his own wishes.’

Leaving football aside, then, it seems fair to assume that the director of _Scum_, _Contact_ et al was drawn to _The Firm_ because of what it had to say about the masculine propensity to violence and how this can be massaged if one keeps very intensely homosocial company. ‘Funny old guy, Alan’, Gary Oldman recalls, ‘because he abhorred violence, was appalled by it. And yet he could display it so well because he had a great understanding of where it was coming from.’

_The Firm_ is about prospering estate agent Clive ‘Bexy’ Bissell (Oldman), a man who – as David Leland put it – loves his wife, loves his family, and loves to slash the faces of people he hates with a Stanley knife. No stereotypical knuckle-dragging yob, then. But through Bexy – and Davis’s Yeti, with his Ray-Bans, ponytail, white mac, and convertible GTI – Clarke was clearly gesturing to a particular 1980s ‘type’: the ‘yuppie’, a well-paid professional with no care for anything but his or her self-gratification.

Is _The Firm_ an authentic account of 80s-era hooliganism in the UK? It certainly references various socio-economic factors that had changed football by that time – the mixed fortunes of the game’s traditional working-class constituencies, the rising violence in and around the grounds, and the growing subcultural obsession with what was the right clobber to wear to the match. But one could argue that Clarke threw into this mix a special despair he was feeling about the state of the nation. ‘Alan certainly got very tired of England in the 80s,’ remembers Jane Harris, Clarke’s ex-partner and mother of his two children. ‘It was becoming a mean little country and he didn’t like that.’

In Gary Oldman, Clarke at least found a lead actor with brilliance and authenticity to spare. ‘I was never a member of a crew,’ Oldman says of his south London upbringing, ‘but I was born within the sound of Millwall supporters.’ By 1988 Oldman had played Sid Vicious and Joe Orton and worked with Nic Roeg; and he was aware that Clarke, discoverer of Ray Winstone and Tim Roth, preferred not to cast known faces. But once the two men had met and hit it off, Oldman’s name was first on the team-sheet.

A whole cottage industry’s worth of books and films about British hooliganism have come out since _The Firm_, and most have seemed to want to rub their real-life subjects the right way with tasty accounts of hard-man behaviour. _The Firm_ does none of that. And if its towering bleakness is maybe not the happiest memorial to Alan Clarke, the undeniable brilliance of the direction certainly is.
