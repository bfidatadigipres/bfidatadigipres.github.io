_We are pleased to be screening an original 35mm distribution print of this film. Given its age, the colour of the picture has now faded to a pink hue. We hope this does not take away from your enjoyment of what is quite a unique opportunity to view such a rare print._

A young woman, newly released from a psychiatric institution, moves with her husband into a country farmhouse on an eerie, rural island. There, they encounter a mysterious drifter, whose presence seems to trigger Jessica (Lampert), who begins to hear voices and experience a series of chilling visions. The longer she stays on the island, the more Jessica suspects this strange woman is not as she appears. John Hancock expertly builds up tension in the film as it edges towards its white-kuckle climax. Part gothic horror, part psychological thriller, John Hancock’s dream-like vampire tale is a meditative, quietly terrifying exploration of escalating paranoia and anxiety.

In _Sight and Sound_’s 2012 poll, John Hancock’s _Let’s Scare Jessica to Death_ (1971) ranks as the 894th Greatest Film of All Time. A further click on the BFI website reveals ‘one critic voted for this film’. Reader, I am that critic. I’ve voted for it again in 2022. In the build-up to the big reveal, I’m almost more interested to see if the needle moves for _Jessica_ – which has had more attention in recent years – than in whether _Vertigo_ (1958) gets bumped from the Number One spot.

Everyone asked to vote has their own criteria: varying definitions of greatness, personal enthusiasms balanced against reverence for the canon, a zeal to overturn established pantheons and elevate less familiar films to cobwebbed plinths, even a listmaker’s nagging need to ensure a top ten represents a range rather than a cluster from a favourite filmmaker or area of specialisation. The diva who took seven of her own records to that desert island on the wireless has few equivalents in the diverse international electorate. No matter how much consideration the voter might give to the notion of ‘greatness’ as being distinct from ‘favourite’, it is, in the end, a personal choice.

The higher reaches of the list, with films whose votes are up in the hundreds, are where some sort of consensus emerges. Yet even that is arbitrary and fragile. In the inaugural 1952 poll, Robert Flaherty’s _Louisiana Story_ (1948) was joint fifth in the top ten; by 2012, it was ranked 588th, with a vote of two (one more than _Jessica_, admittedly). A key change is simple: _Sight and Sound_ now polls a lot more critics than it did at the outset (_Louisiana Story_ got its place with only 12 votes) and makes an effort to solicit votes from a wider range of voices. This inevitably means a longer list, with many, many more one- and two-vote titles.

So, do I really think that a 1971 horror movie is one of the Ten Greatest Films of All Time? Yes, of course I do. I wouldn’t have voted for it if I didn’t.

But it’s complicated. And personal. I first saw _Let’s Scare Jessica to Death_ at the Palace Theatre, Bridgwater, in Somerset, in 1973, when I was 14  (i.e., underage for the X certificate). It was the first grownup horror film that genuinely terrified me. It combines the relentless approach of George Romero with the quieter chills of the classic ghost story as shuffling townsfolk (bearing scars that show they’ve been bled by the local vampire) besiege a New England farm and mentally fragile incomer Jessica (Zohra Lampert) finds her friends taken from or turned against. A sequence shot in broad daylight in which Jessica and her nemesis Emily (Mariclare Costello) take a swim is among the most purely frightening moments of cinema, with a payoff as Emily disappears under the water while wearing a black bathing suit only to bob up moments later in a soaked 19th-century wedding dress and advance, zombie-like, out of the lake.

It’s a movie unconstrained by genre, made by people who wanted to do something scary but for whom that wasn’t the limit of their ambitions. The lasting impact of a horror film can be gauged by how often subsequent horrors riff on it – decades on, not a week passes without a film xeroxing _Psycho_ (1960), _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968), _The Exorcist_ (1973), _Jaws_ (1975) or _Halloween_ (1978). _Jessica_ is evoked less often, but Alex Ross Perry’s _Queen of Earth_ (2015) and A.D. Calvo’s _Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl_ (2016) use it as a touchstone.

For ages, it was a film only I seemed to have seen, though its stature as a minor classic has become more secure (it’s central to Kier-La Janisse’s 2012 book _House of Psychotic Women_). Horror films work on specific fears and interests. Certainly, there are connections between Jessica and my own experience: as a child, I was moved from the city to the country by craftsman parents who bought a derelict farmhouse (with an orchard) and made a going concern of the place despite a certain hostility from the locals. This, loosely, is what happens in _Jessica_. I had a similar, immediate, personal connection with Don Taylor’s terrifying TV episode _The Exorcism_, part of the anthology series _Dead of Night_ (1972).

I can also see how random circumstance – unconnected with the quality of the film but all to do with me – dictates my conviction. I recognise that polling people for the Ten Greatest Anything is inherently absurd, but it’s also interesting. We learn a lot from these lists, about ourselves as much as the films we vote for (or don’t).

If the stars had aligned slightly differently, Willard Huyck’s _Messiah of Evil_ (1973) might have got a UK theatrical release in the 1970s, but it was one of many, many American independent horror films that didn’t (_Jessica_, in this respect, was lucky – it was made by Paramount). I didn’t see _Messiah_ until it turned up on poor quality VHS in the 1980s; I’ve still never seen it in a cinema. _Sight and Sound_ didn’t review it until 2010. Objectively, _Messiah of Evil_ is close to _Let’s Scare Jessica to Death_ in quality. If I’d seen it at 14, in a cinema, it might have left as big an impression on me as Hancock’s film. So when asked to nominate my favourite horror movies or film experiences or Greatest Film of All Time candidates, _Jessica_ is confirmed in my mind while _Messiah_ isn’t.

Now magnify that by every choice made by every critic in the poll.
