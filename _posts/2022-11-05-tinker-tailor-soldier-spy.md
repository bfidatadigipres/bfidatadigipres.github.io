With a remarkable cast (Benedict Cumberbatch, Kathy Burke, Tom Hardy and Stephen Graham are in there too), this adaptation of John Le Carré’s Cold War espionage mystery is inevitably classy and (given the running time) complex in its plotting. As the taciturn George Smiley, brought out of retirement to investigate a mole within MI6, Oldman bravely – and very successfully – follows in Alec Guinness’s footsteps.

Two big questions hover over the film _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_. How good a slow-burn spy thriller is it, and how well does it adapt one of the trickier narratives in contemporary fiction? Retired agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is brought back to uncover painstakingly the identity of a mole – a double agent, working for the Soviets – who is one of the four men who currently lead the ‘Circus’, author John le Carré’s nickname for MI6. _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ is set in the early years of the 1970s. It was, historically, another low dishonest decade, as Auden called the 1930s, and for most cinemagoers in 2011 it will be ancient history: interesting, but not quite as interesting as the 1950s or 60s – currently being boomed on television by _Mad Men_ and _The Hour_. _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_’s director Tomas Alfredson, one calculates, was a six-year-old in Stockholm in 1971 not particularly concerned, one presumes, about the Cold War, from which Sweden had wisely kept itself neutral.

Dense historical framework is vital to le Carré’s design and the moral climate of his trilogy – of which _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ is the first part – charting Smiley’s battle of wits with the Soviet intelligence officer codenamed Karla. With 127 minutes of screen time at its disposal, the film can only lightly sketch in that framework (which it does brilliantly), whereas the 1979 BBC television adaptation had 290 minutes to air le Carré’s nuances. Smiley, the novel is at pains to stress, belongs to that heroic generation of war-winning gentleman spies. He is ‘loyal to his own time’ – but his time is passing. Alfredson conveys this sense of _fin de ligne_ by means of a pervasively crepuscular tone – this is a film without luminosity. Darkness is falling for Smiley’s generation. His unmasking of Karla’s mole – the cancer destroying the agency – will be a partial vindication of the cause he has served: his ‘legacy’, a monument. It could even, who knows, be a cure for what has gone so badly wrong.

If war is fog, espionage brews the mother of fogs. Nebulosity works in  
le Carré’s novels, but it poses problems for film. Alfredson – on the evidence of _Let the Right One In_, whose unexpected success surely brought him this plum assignment – is extraordinarily strong on mood. Scripted by Bridget O’Connor and Peter Straughan, this adaptation sharpens up le Carré drastically, creating (as the novelist never does) a clear-cut beginning, middle and end, but contriving to retain the murky essence of the source text. There is homage, even in the necessary infidelities of the adaptation. The end of the film may be, for some tastes, rather too clear-cut (Alfredson does not have the luxury of two sequels). The beginning – a shootout in Budapest as the attempt to ‘turn’ a Hungarian general goes wrong – involves some radical rearrangement of le Carré’s text. Purists may object that le Carré does the episode off stage by report and gossip, not as in-your-face action. But the creation of tension, nervousness and – finally – debacle is masterfully done. One forgives Alfredson his liberties.

In later stretches of narrative, Alfredson skilfully thins down le Carré. Smiley’s incorrigibly faithless wife Ann, a major presence in the novel, is almost wholly absent. Only a shapely rump, writhing in adulterous embrace, remains. George (ever the spy) is watching that rump. He too writhes. Spies? Voyeurs? What’s the difference? Both are engaged in a dirty-minded business. The scene in Delhi with Karla, lengthy and pivotal in the novel, is similarly reduced to a few glimpsed moments. Karla is there – but as a shadow. Many other things are done as adeptly. The film’s periodisation is pitch-perfect. Dimplex, Gannex and Ajax (if you don't know what they are, you weren’t there) feature nostalgically among the many tactfully placed props. The feel of the film (for those who were there) is eerily accurate.

Scandinavian is the favoured flavour for popular narrative at the moment. The Swedish director brings a tartness to the narrative which, like the drop of angostura in Smiley’s pink gin, sours the whole. Put another way, there’s a palpable whiff of _Wallander_ in Gary Oldman’s thoughtful interpretation of Smiley – the same clever use of meditative, inscrutable silence. Particularly effective – and original to the film, I think – are the scenes of Smiley swimming in Hampstead, horn-rims firmly on, hair Brylcreemed back, brain, underneath, working remorselessly. In Alfredson’s film, le Carré’s primal influence is necessarily felt – but not dictatorially. Liberties are taken. Rather more conflicting is the makers’ (and doubtless some of the audience’s) concurrent awareness of earlier adaptations. How to capitalise on, yet differentiate the film from, the overwhelmingly successful 1979 TV version? How to use the widely listened to 1988 and 2009 radio versions? Use, that is, and at the same time create a necessary dividing space. Some of the film’s cast (notably Oldman) hew very different interpretations from preceding adaptations; others stay close.

Alfredson’s _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ is a hugely successful treatment of formidably resistant materials. He achieves his success by interpreting le Carré, and taking his interpretation in some illuminatingly new directions (of which, one is told, the author, who made a papal visit or two to the set, approved). The cast is immensely strong and, one senses, Alfredson has allowed what is the cream of the current British acting troupe a corresponding freedom to interpret their roles. Oldman, in particular, makes full use of that freedom. In short this is as much an enrichment as an adaptation of the book Alfredson was given to remake. One can only hope that the film will do as well as it deserves to and that the director will be assigned the remaining parts of the trilogy.
