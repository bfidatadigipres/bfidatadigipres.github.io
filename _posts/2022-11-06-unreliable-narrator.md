Veracity and doubt play off each other to uncanny, witty ends in imaginative films by Greenaway, John Smith, Patrick Keiller, Steven Ball and Philip Sanderson. The voice illuminates and obscures in equal measure, dryly satirising the authority of the documentary narrator, and interrogating film language and the relationships between sound and image. Weird tales and odd instructions seep up through the gaps.

**Windows**  
Composed of shots of windows taken from inside the director’s house, Peter Greenaway’s _jeu d’esprit_ offers a miniature groundplan for what was to grow, immensely, into one of his abiding concerns: the poetic possibilities and humorous plausibility of precisely marshalled statistics. The narrator, as always the acme of authority, gives some of the facts attached to 37 people who met their ends in the parish of W. in 1973 as a result of falling out of windows. One was a harpsichordist whose spirited playing can be heard on the soundtrack. The chief pleasure of this snippet derives from the density of Greenaway’s writing, his skill in investing a well-turned sentence with unspoken possibilities. ‘At sunset on 14th April1973, the seamstress and the student of aeronautics who played the harpsichord jumped into a plum-tree from a window in this house’. In the last moment of the film, ‘this house’ – Greenaway’s house, his imagination, that which we have been observing from the inside – is suddenly introduced, connected with these thirty-seven people in the mythical parish of W. An ornithologist makes an appearance; there are several violent unexplained deaths; one man under the influence of an unknown drug thought he could fly... Though only four minutes long, _Windows_ sheds considerable light on Greenaway’s interior landscape: it is also a conjuring trick, an example of making something out of nothing.  
**John Pym, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, April 1972**  

**Girl Chewing Gum**  
Experimental film which draws attention to the cinematic codes and illusions it incorporates by denying their existence, treating representation as absolute reality. A random street scene in Dalston. The ‘director’s’ voice instructs peremptorily making it appear that the accidental arrival and movements of people in the frame are actually carried out to comply with his demands.  

**Dear Phone**  
Static shots of manuscripts retailing various fantasies all revolving round protagonists with the initials H.C. and their use of the telephone are juxtaposed with shots of red telephone boxes. Over the former, a narrator smoothly reads the manuscript’s largely illegible text; over the latter, various telephone sounds-ringing, engaged and dialling tones, the speaking clock and conversations on crossed lines-are heard.

_Dear Phone_, together with _Water Wrackets_, bridges the gap between Greenaway’s earlier ‘home movies’ (_Intervals_, _H Is for House_ and _Windows_) and the later, more ‘public’ works such as _A Walk through H_ and _The Falls_. Partly cunning pastiche, largely impromptu invention, this light-hearted expose of structuralist conventions yields itself easily to the film-maker’s more directly personal concerns. Greenaway’s attraction to lost and forgotten corners of domestic landscape avoids the charge of whimsy because it is formulated as part and parcel of the conventional filmmaking process. Images of the original manuscript are juxtaposed with its supposedly transparent yet necessarily opaque realisation on celluloid. Assembly of the film is then completed by the addition of a ‘final mix’ sound track. This is composed solely of post-synch sound effects and commentary that supposedly reinforce yet necessarily contradict the edited pictures: telephone tones are heard only over shots of empty call-boxes, and the narrator’s unhesitating voice only over images of the illegible manuscript. Thus, the conventional relationship between script, image and sound is shown to be as essentially contingent as that between subject and object in lived experience.

Every Greenaway film, but _Dear Phone_ in particular, is marked by an existentialist intuition that its own reality as an act (the presence of the author) contradicts its reality as an event (the absence of the same author) – that cinema’s ‘esse’, to reverse the Berkeleyan dictum, ‘_non_ est percipi’. In _Camera Lucida_, Roland Barthes states, ‘The Photographer’s “second sight” does not consist in “seeing” but in being there... Every Photograph is a certificate of presence’. The cinematic effect of Greenaway’s absurdist fantasies is, paradoxically, to ground the ‘being’ of the Photographer /Filmmaker in reality, in an English world of ‘noise’ as frighteningly total, self-sufficient and real, in its own polyglot way, as Chantal Akerman’s New York (_News from Home_), Marguerite Duras’ suburbs (_Le Camion_) or Raul Ruiz’s arrondissement (_De grands evenements et de gens ordinaries_). What all these films have in common is a static picture-track (authenticity / Death of the Photograph) in opposition to a moving sound track (fiction / Life of the Voice). The difference between them and Greenaway lies in his greater and more ruthless modernity, which eschews all the older and more humane traditions of an art uninflected by television. Both the documentary and fictional subjects and objects in his work seem ‘fixed’ in the grain of the image’s finitude, mummified in such unnatural things as a telephone box, outside time (unlike, say, the characters who live through Duras’ _India Song_). But, in the age of the Photograph – fast fading as Duras herself realised – the ability to conceive of Time as duration also seems to be disappearing. Communication, as on the telephone, now must be instantaneous to be effective.  
**Robert Brown, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, April 1972**  

**Insight: Terence Conran**  
A short film on the designer and entrepreneur of modern industrial design Terence Conran.  

**Green on the Horizon**  
An enigmatic, haunting blend of fake public information film and occult jaunt. A woman tours the sparse marshlands of southern England, but what is she seeking? With a tape recorder as her guide, she travels by bike and by foot in pursuit of her secret mission. This playful Super 8 film was, said the filmmakers, ‘influenced as much by Tarkovsky and _The Avengers_ as it was by avant-garde formalism.’  

**The Clouds**  
With its dense, poetic and philosophical text and its sequences of apparently unrelated images, _The Clouds_ (d. Patrick Keiller, 1990) has many threads: the narrator makes parallels between his own conception and birth and the geological formation of the earth. Descriptions of geological time are echoed by images of rocks and water. Mythical giants who lived early in the earth’s history show their remains in electricity pylons that dominate the landscape; boats and bridges are the backdrop to Kathleen Ferrier’s rendition of traditional Scottish song.

Keiller’s characteristic use of shots in which the camera doesn’t move, but instead switches from one scene to another, or between different perspectives on the same scene, is reminiscent of the early British documentary tradition, of Humphrey Jennings and even Free Cinema. But Keiller has moved away from using images to narrate, using them rather to obliquely illustrate a fractured and personal text.

_The Clouds_ is a film poem: its meanings are not exhausted in a single viewing, and one can return to it and discover new things, new connections between separate images, and between words and images. It also crystallises many of the methods of composition and narration that Keiller would use in his next, feature-length films, _London_ (1994) and _Robinson in Space_ (1996).
