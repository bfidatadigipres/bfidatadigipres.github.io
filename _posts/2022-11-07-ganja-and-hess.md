Marlene Clark and Duane Jones star as the eponymous lovers of Bill Gunn’s iconic vampire romance, one of the defining classics of the genre. After his erratic assistant stabs him with an ancient dagger, anthropologist Dr Hess Green (Jones) is afflicted with a ravenous craving for blood. When his assistant’s wife Ganja Meda (Clark) comes looking for her now dead husband, she and Hess fall passionately in love.  
**Kelli Weston, bfi.org.uk**  

Philadelphia-born actor/playwright/novelist/ director Bill Gunn, who died from encephalitis in 1989 aged 54, remains one of America’s most underrated creative forces. He was a fiercely individualistic talent whose work tackled issues germane to the African-American experience with an ingenuity and complexity that few could match. His acerbic screenplay for Hal Ashby’s _The Landlord_ (1970), for example, gets to the heart of white middle-class gentrification of economically deprived black areas in a manner that resounds today. Even in the more permissive climate of late-60s/early-70s American cinema, Gunn’s work was seen by the establishment as overly controversial: his feature debut _Stop_ (1970) – a tortuous love-quadrangle – was slapped with an X certificate, before Warner Bros recut and finally shelved it. It remains unseen today, though there is hope that it will be unearthed.

The issue of frustrated expectations is relevant to Gunn’s best-known work, _Ganja & Hess_, which boasts its own dismaying history of troubled distribution. Its studio, Kelly-Jordan Enterprises, was expecting a straightforward blaxploitation cash-in after the success of William Crain’s lurid _Blacula_ (1972), and was horrified when Gunn delivered nothing of the sort. Despite its rapturous reception at Cannes in 1973, the film was swiftly recut into a travesty of skinflick salaciousness, and boxed up under no fewer than six different titles including _Blackout: The Moment of Terror_ and, even more terribly, _Black Evil_.

So what offended the studio so much? Well, even by elliptical arthouse standards, _Ganja & Hess_ is a challenging work. It’s a bleak, kaleidoscopic vampire film in which the V-word is never once mentioned, and it substitutes bloody thrills for an oblique mélange of contemporary class, racial and religious commentary, Afro-European symbolism and sexual deviance. Its fragmentary structure and explicit (but never titillating) fusion of sex and death recalls the psychologically troubling work of Nicolas Roeg (in particular 1980’s _Bad Timing_) more than the Manichean social dynamics of standard blaxploitation fare.

The hazy plot follows the exploits of wealthy anthropologist Dr Hess Green (_Night of the Living Dead_’s Duane Jones), who becomes a vampire after his crazed assistant George Meda (a terrifyingly intense Gunn) stabs him with a dagger that carries an ancient African curse. Meda commits suicide, and Green falls in love with his haughty widow Ganja (the statuesque Marlene Clark), who soon becomes his vampiric partner in crime.

This troubling film is so visually rich and thematically complex that it’s not hard to see why Spike Lee co-opted it for his forthcoming Kickstarter-funded remake _Da Sweet Blood of Jesus_. If Lee attains half the disquieting power of Gunn’s film, he’ll do well.
