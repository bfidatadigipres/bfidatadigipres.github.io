Horror icon Barbara Hershey stars in this underseen and affecting film about a single mother repeatedly attacked by an unseen force. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and hounded by this spectral creature for no apparent reason – and no one will believe or help her in her ordeal. Released in the same year as _Poltergeist_, whose success eclipsed it, this remains one of the most affecting horror films you’ll see.  
**Anna Bogutskaya, bfi.org.uk**  

Given the story’s claim to a basis in truth (though what self-respecting horror movie can nowadays dispense with such a claim?), _The Entity_’s formulary aspect is doubly disturbing, as though the thing itself had been observing trends in the movie market and come up with a combination guaranteed to get it on the screen: an invisible macho rapist violating a single working mother in Southern California.

Frank DeFelitta’s screenplay, taken from his own ‘true’ novel, dutifully surrounds Carla with a supporting cast from any B-horror flick: a psychiatrist who argues earnestly for a rational interpretation (Sneiderman may look modern, object to smoking, say ‘fuck’ a lot and drive a late-model Volkswagen, but is otherwise straight out of the 1950s); a boyfriend who sees the attacks as rendering Carla unfit to be his wife; and a team of daffy parapsychologists who look as though they may at any moment decide to play it all for laughs, but are nevertheless on hand to provide the requisite note of religious awe (‘Hang in there, Joe’, comments one as the experiment gets under way. ‘And pray’ adds Dr Cooley thoughtfully).

The plot is equally full of loose ends: how, for example, does Carla manage to hide from Jerry the appalling bruises she shows to Sneiderman? Why is the total destruction of Cindy’s apartment never referred to again, since it is plainly the work of a force infinitely stronger than Carla? And would the parapsychologists really walk out on Carla pre-midnight, muttering, ‘If you’ll excuse us, Mrs Moran... ‘? The nature of the attacks is also a highly ambiguous, not to say exploitative, approach to certain areas of sexuality, notably wife-battering and the implication that Carla may encourage and even, in some way, enjoy her defilement.

But leaving aside such niceties of interpretation, the film barrels its way through events, helped by a finely understated performance from Barbara Hershey and a highly skilled construction along the lines of basic cinematic effect. DeFelitta’s screenplay has much of the genuine chill of his earlier Audrey Rose, and _The_ _Entity_, despite all its formulary ingredients, actually works rather well. The attack in the bathroom, building from an ominous series of strange angles of Carla relaxing in the tub, via a door quietly closing, to her being jerked round the room by her invisible assailant, is neither very profound nor very pleasant, but it is well put together.
