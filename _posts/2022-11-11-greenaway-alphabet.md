Anyone looking for a way into the works of Peter Greenaway would do well to begin with _The Greenaway Alphabet_. His films are visually appealing but can challenge the unsuspecting viewer not prepared for their density of ideas and references. This very personal documentary by multimedia artist Saskia Boddeke, also Greenaway’s wife and collaborator, offers an insight into the man, his inspirations and the autobiographical and psychological background to his work.

We learn that his daughters from his first marriage appear as two of the characters in _The Falls_ (1980), while a nostalgic visit to his childhood home in Newport, South Wales, is linked to scenes of wartime Britain in his Tulse Luper trilogy. It emerges that the character of Smut in _Drowning by Numbers_ (1988) is based on Greenaway as a child, exhibiting the fascination with collecting and classifying that the director inherited from his father.

In contrast to the fairly rigorous order of Greenaway’s films, the organisation of _The Greenaway Alphabet_ feels more instinctive and free-flowing. And this is not  just Peter Greenaway’s alphabet, but that of his wife and, especially, their daughter Pip, his companion and foil throughout the film. Ideas and thoughts seem to surface naturally through their conversations rather than being predetermined or imposed.

As well as baring Greenaway’s soul, Saskia literally undresses him, which seems only fair as he has demanded the same of most of his actors over the years. She films him naked on the beach and in other intimate situations, such as having his hair cut or trying on trousers at the tailor, mundane moments that possess an honesty and simplicity.

This is very much Boddeke’s film and she deftly maintains the balance between the personal and the objective; affection for the subject is implicit but doesn’t obscure truth. At times she emulates Greenaway’s penchant for symmetrical framing, elsewhere using clips, multiple screens and projections to convey the effect she wants. Most appealing are the scenarios in which Peter and Pip engage in intellectual or artistic exercises in carefully chosen locations. Though staged, these vignettes never feel artificial and reveal an endearing side to Greenaway that rarely surfaced in public during the 1980s and 1990s.

During these decades, he was declared both a genius and ‘the most arrogant man in British cinema’ and, while the genius is still apparent, the arrogance appears to have faded with age. Any residual pretension is quickly dispensed by Saskia’s frank, no-nonsense interjections and Pip’s tenacious inquisitiveness. He certainly isn’t a ‘regular dad’ and, growing up in such a creative environment, it’s no surprise that Pip herself has become an artist.

At one point, Pip asks her father about his legacy, something he surely need not worry about. Whatever your view of his films (or of the concept of cinematic authorship), he is undeniably one of the few true auteurs of British cinema and from _The Greenaway Alphabet_ it’s clear that his imagination and delight in the act of creation show no signs of waning. He has several films, artworks and writing projects in train and we can only hope he sees them all through to completion. In the meantime, Boddeke’s film eloquently reminds us of the humour and passion with which he purveys his unique view of art and human nature.

A lesson in lexicography, _H Is for House_ recounts the objects that begin with the letter H, as seen through the eye of a child – a tactic later to feature in the narrative for _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ when an aristocratic toddler produces his own rendition of the country house’s gardens. But it is also a playful translation of sorts of the Canadian avant garde film _Zorns Lemma_ (1970) by Hollis Frampton, in which the letters of the alphabet are serially moved through by way of images that represent or evoke each letter. The associations in Frampton’s film move from the obvious to the abstract and actively engage the viewer in decoding its rationale. Smoke is at what pointed used to represent the letter ‘S’. The connections are not always so obvious.

As Greenaway himself remarked for the benefit of cataloguers at the BFI National Archive: ‘No scripting in this film – it again follows the credo – make a film of collected images filmed in a casual way of what turns up whilst enjoying – for example – a country walk, often with my young family of the time – walking at their pace, interested in what at that time they were interested in – let the images dictate.’ Greenaway’s sharp eye would break down these eerie landscapes into a series of interrelated puzzle-like frames, just enough for him to retrospectively wind tall tales around like a knot. Or perhaps that should be a slip knot.

While the images in Greenaway’s features would often be centred around symmetrical framing and distance, his early films were constructed differently. Walking green landscapes surrounding the Wiltshire villages of Wardour and Bridzor – ‘They sound like Tolkien locations’ he says – Greenaway reflected on their deeply inscribed histories, noting how their once substantial populations had been decimated by the Black Death in 1346. The timeless rural idyll of the English countryside gives birth to fantasy and whichever narrative it is we want, and whether we make reference to their histories or not; a quality Greenaway fully exploited. Not least by playing with the dialogues that can take place between image and text.
