_Please note, the discussion will take place before the screening. The panel will feature music supervisor (for John Hughes) Tarquin Gotch; journalist and 80s film enthusiast Hadley Freeman; musician, composer and member of  The Dream Academy Nick Laird-Clowes. The event will be hosted by writer and broadcaster Matt Everitt._

Judd Nelson marching across a playing field to Simple Minds’ ‘Don’t You (Forget About Me)’ in _The Breakfast Club_ (1985); Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy getting together at _Pretty in Pink_’s prom to OMD’s ‘If You Leave’; Matthew Broderick singing ‘Danke Schoen’ on a float in _Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_ (both 1986). Some directors craft indelible images, some film unforgettable dialogue. But if no one would claim John Hughes as a visual poet, his 1980s filmography delivers, time and again, narrative crescendos in which the moment and its music are so right for each other that they become more than the sum of their parts.

‘His knowledge of music was incredible,’ recalls Tarquin Gotch, the A&R and manager who, on a visit to the set of _Weird Science_ (1985), fell into a day-long conversation with Hughes which led to several years working as his music supervisor. Hughes integrated music from the earliest stages: ‘He would write them into the script,’ says Gotch. Both Ringwald (_Sixteen Candles_,  _The Breakfast Club_, _Pretty in Pink_) and Anthony Michael Hall (_Sixteen Candles_, _The Breakfast Club_) received mixtapes from Hughes as sonic mood-boards for planned projects that never went into production. Fusing scene and song from the start gave Hughes a hotline to his audience, as the intensity of adolescent identification with pop music found itself reflected on screen. ‘He was showing teenagers’ inner lives,’ says Gotch, ‘talking to the outsiders he identified with and telling them they weren’t alone.’ It was a move that came naturally to Hughes, music having already served that purpose when he was a teenager himself. ‘He wasn’t a jock, he wasn’t a nerd; his ability to find cool music was what John used in high school himself to differentiate himself, to give himself  a clique.’

‘He had such a keen ear,’ says Nick Laird-Clowes, whose cover of The Smiths’ ‘Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want’, with his group The Dream Academy, scores Cameron Frye’s encounter with George Seurat’s _A Sunday on La Grande Jatte_ (1884-86) at the Art Institute of Chicago – a brief oasis of calm in the midst of Ferris Bueller’s general misrule. ‘’He was bold enough that he could use pop music – quite indie pop music – and not be frightened to throw out the score. And it wasn’t just to tell you when the film was set, or a marketing tie-in.’ Substituting songs for score also gave Hughes’s films a straightforward vérité: Jon Cryer’s Duckie, mourning unrequited love in _Pretty in Pink_, would most likely listen to The Smiths, not a string orchestra. ‘The long-suffering Ira Newborn [Hughes’s regular composer] described himself as “king of the stings” [short musical phrases], as that was all that was left of his scores after John had finished with them,’ Gotch tells me. Hughes was hardly the first to raid jukeboxes for his soundtracks, but his selections were carefully designed to express something mere action could not, rather than provide period detail or a quick time-stamp. Compare a precursor such as _American Graffiti_ (1973), George Lucas’s classic snapshot of teen suburbia, which rounded up 1950s rock ’n’ roll (including The Crests’ 1958 hit ‘16 Candles’) but with the more blandly comprehensive effect of a Greatest Hits or Best Of.

A forthcoming CD and vinyl set, _Life Moves Pretty Fast: The John Hughes Mixtapes_, a sprawling 74-track compilation, draws on his run of films from _Sixteen Candles_ (1984) to _Uncle Buck_ (1989). It celebrates his ability to utilise 80s pop, from its dream-home heartaches to its fight for the right to party, from mainstream to underground. And it effectively creates one new master mixtape by shuffling together songs from different films, out of their chronological order. This obscures but doesn’t conceal Hughes satisfying a particular obsession: the Day-glo melodies and synthetic sensibilities of the era’s British pop music. OMD, Spandau Ballet, Yello, Kajagoogoo, Nick Heyward and New Order, but also its rougher edges: Killing Joke, The Jesus and Mary Chain or The Psychedelic Furs. Gotch had to open an account with Rough Trade to feed Hughes’s Anglophile habit. ‘The best thing was when we were all in Los Angeles: we’d go round to his house, he’d have an edit of the new film and we’d literally needledrop [with different records], trying music against picture.’ But finding exactly the right song was not always the end. ‘You’d want to run round the house cheering, but then he’d say, “Now let’s try something completely different,” and put on some country or opera.’

Box-office success bought Hughes creative and financial control, and with it the ability not just to license but to commission his favourite artists. His hands-on approach had something of the original meaning of A&R, matching artist to repertoire. Simple Minds didn’t write their most famous hit, ‘Don’t You (Forget About Me)’, but were talked into covering the song, written by one of the film’s composers. With _Pretty in Pink_, Hughes asked OMD for a short-order emergency rewrite. ‘We came over to LA, armed with a two-inch tape of our song “Goddess of Love”, which we’d written for the movie,’ says Andy McCluskey, the group’s singer, ‘only to be informed by John, “I like the song but it doesn’t make sense now, because we’re reshooting the ending… Can you write another?” We worked until 3am writing “If You Leave”. It was proper Tin Pan Alley songwriting to order.’ After using This Mortal Coil’s ‘Song to the Siren’ (a Tim Buckley cover) during production of _She’s Having a Baby_ (1988) for its climactic birth scene, Hughes was turned down flat by the group. Their replacement was Kate Bush, whose ‘This Woman’s Work’, unusually, plays from start to finish. It’s considered to be one of her greatest songs. ‘Unbelievable. I found it so emotional,’ says Nick Laird-Clowes. ‘I couldn’t believe it had been a commission.’

Hughes’s approach pre-dated the 90s mixtape movies of Tarantino – a director who’s said that he scripts films after, not before, compiling their soundtracks. But he also left an aesthetic strong enough to sustain considerable warping at the hands of later directors: Richard Kelly’s _Donnie Darko_ (2001), with its high-school setting and Anglophile soundtrack (Tears for Fears, Duran Duran, Echo & the Bunnymen), is essentially a Hughes movie pushed through a subversive wormhole. More recently, the way _SpiderMan: Into the Spider-Verse_ (2018) creates a mixtape of newly commissioned work by hip-hop names that perfectly reflects Miles Morales’s adolescent sound-world, written into the fabric of the screenplay, is deeply Hughes-ian. _Stranger Things_, meanwhile, has mined similar Hughes-meets-Amblin effects across four series, giving Kate Bush a Number One in ‘Running up That Hill (A Deal with God)’ – 37 years after its release. ‘If _Stranger Things_ wants to do the same for us,’ McCluskey laughs, ‘we’re available.’
