_+ panel and Q&A with writer David Hare and actor Bill Paterson_

Almost incredibly, David Hare made the visually highly sophisticated _Licking Hitler_ ‘without having ever looked down a camera until the first day of shooting. My film directing came primarily from having been to the cinema a lot. It’s my view that anybody who knows what they want to say can develop the means for saying it.’ He was particularly fortunate in having an innovative and supportive producer in David Rose, who had long been aware of Hare not only as a writer but also as a director. As Rose put it: ‘He obviously was very much in command of the direction of his stage plays and knew precisely what he wanted. It seemed to me that among his qualities was a precision that would obviously be very valuable in filmmaking. This feeling was reinforced by the screenplay of _Licking Hitler_; it was clearly written as a film – you could see from the page exactly what he intended to see on screen.’

In spite of Rose’s support, however, Hare still had problems with the BBC.  One of these revolved around the familiar film/play argument: ‘When I insisted at BBC Birmingham on calling _Licking Hitler_ a film, it was thought to be quite controversial because at that time they just didn’t recognise the category of “television film”. Thanks to Channel 4 that’s now changed, and indeed it’s Film on Four which has given the Channel much of its identity to date. I’ve always wanted to work in feature films since I was a boy – it’s what all of us of a certain age always dreamed of doing. Really, I went into the theatre because there was then no possibility going into film. Theatre was a second choice, and indeed it’s generally said of my stage writing that it’s cinematic, that it’s trying to burst out of the stage, and that there’s a certain freedom of movement through time and place. I don’t, however, write short scenes, and an awful lot of “epic” writing that I now see on stage has suffered terribly from a misunderstanding of the epic form. A number of young writers seem to think that if you write a great many monologues and short scenes, that’s epic writing. But epic writing on stage is actually about juxtaposition, about what you put next to what, and I’m afraid that television, too, has been an appalling influence in making writers think that plays are just little bits of scenes dribbled together.’

Formal questions loomed large in Hare’s arguments with the BBC hierarchy over _Licking Hitler_. In the first place, corporation executives tried to insist that he shoot more sequences outside in order to ‘justify’ his use of film as opposed to videotape. Hare is particularly hostile to video, for two main reasons: ‘I dislike the look of video and I dislike the way in which it is rehearsed. I associate it with production values which are not my own. The performance is the thing that gets put in last and is considered least important. No director, no matter how good he is, can ignore the pressures of time and the technical process, and the actor is simply expected to perform at the last possible moment. And it’s a bastard medium – the actor can neither get the “through line” on his part which he can in the theatre, nor can he get the moment-to-moment steady construction of his part which he can from film by examining every single second. And so he’s left recording in these half-baked slabs, and because video is a bad acting medium it’s not good for any work which happens to depend on good acting.’

Secondly, Hare’s refusal to shoot ‘cover’ raised a few hackles in the corporation. This way of working is part of his deliberate and concerted attempt to get away from what he calls ‘the depressing grammar of so much British television – the master-shot, the two-shot and the close-up.’ As he points out, however, not shooting cover both requires a certain amount of nerve on the director’s part and also poses an implicit challenge to the power of the producer: ‘It really does need courage when you’re shooting just to let things go and trust them. If you don’t shoot cover then that means that the producer has to accept the film in the form that the director intends it; there are no choices left in the editing room. That’s why some producers still sometimes order directors to shoot cover. When I made _Licking Hitler_, I was continually asked why I didn’t make master-shots – the people back home really felt a loss of power. But of course directors fear this way of working too because they are liable to get trapped in performances which may not be the performances  they want.’
