**A contemporary review**  
The blossoming new black cinema is gradually reclaiming the generic territory seeded by the 70s wave of Blaxploitation pictures. While _New Jack City_ redrafted the parameters of _Shaft_ and _Superfly_, _Def by Temptation_ returns to the potentially rich area of black horror first colonised by the absurd _Blacula_ and then enhanced by more interesting, albeit marginal, pieces like Bill Gunn’s _Ganja and Hess_. The guiding spirit of Spike Lee is also in evidence: the opening sequence, in which a black bartender spiels on the phone to a succession of girlfriends before succumbing to the wiles of the temptress, seems to have strayed in from _She’s Gotta Have It_, while later barroom encounters, preceding the ‘feeding’ scenes between the shape-changing temptress and her victims, have the feel of a black version of _Cheers_.

This sharp, funny and borderline creepy socio-sexual horror story continues with a series of ambiguous scenes in the temptress’ red-sheeted four-poster as she disposes of sundry victims, either in the approved fashion or in more bloody, bizarre manner. On one occasion, she seduces a mainly gay muscle-man into a straight encounter, only to penetrate him anally by (it is implied) growing outsize male sexual equipment. Later she develops fangs borrowed from Fredric March’s Mr Hyde and serpent eyes like those of Jacqueline Pearce in _The Reptile_.

The scenes between Joel and his actor friend are marvellously written and played in a Spike Lee, semi-improvised manner, but the central opposition between the naïve Joel and the inhuman temptress is disappointing, linked as it is to conventional, reactionary values. The complex, amoral world of the bar and the bedroom gives way to a backward-looking moralism that allows for a traditional (albeit in extreme form) vampire movie finish in which faith conquers all and the temptress is reduced to smoking bones by the cross and Joel’s unshakeable faith.
