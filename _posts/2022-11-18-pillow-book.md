**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_The Pillow Book_, it is clear, gathers up the two concerns that have driven so many of Peter Greenaway’s films: the question of sex and power and the question of cinematic representation, of developing a kind of ‘denser’ film than the linear narrative of mainstream Hollywood cinema allows.

That these are his twin obsessions may be what marks him out as an inheritor of the 60s European art movie – for it was the concern with formal experimentation, and with a sexuality that couldn’t be found in mainstream cinema, which gave 60s European art cinema its signature. Yet what is interesting about Greenaway is that he tends, when talking about his own work, to foreground the representation rather than the sex.

Perhaps this is because sex is always a dangerous bargain in his films.  _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ ties together sexual favours with social power – a similar situation to the one in which Nagiko’s father is embroiled in _The Pillow Book_. Sex leads to multiple (off-screen) rape in _The Baby of Mâcon_ and to cannibalism in _The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover_, not to mention the death of Jerome in the present film.

But what is remarkable about _The Pillow Book_, in relation to his recent films, is that sex seems at times not only a liberating compact but a sensuous one. For instance, the effect of the elegant calligraphy on the bodies of the two main actors, Vivien Wu and Ewan McGregor, is often breath-taking  (if troubling) and sometimes erotic.

But the importance of the sensuousness is greater than this implies – for one way of seeing the film is to see it as a riposte, whether consciously or not, to other recent art films about heterosexual sex and representation, such as Jacques Rivette’s _La Belle Noiseuse_. Where in that film the scratching of Michel Piccoli’s pen on paper seems an analogue to a penetrative assault on Emmanuelle Beart’s body, in _The Pillow Book_ the direct painting on the bodies seems rather to offer aesthetic enhancement and pleasure. But most importantly what really separates Greenaway’s from Rivette’s is that in _The Pillow Book_ the heroine stops being the canvas on which the man writes and becomes the writer herself, taking control of her destiny, ready to begin a new life.

So it’s clear that if Greenaway is indebted to the 60s, he is not slavishly so. What marks _The Pillow Book_ out is not merely its partial setting at the millennium, but its millennial or utopian longings. Greenaway seems here to have found a form through which he can imagine past, present, and future on the screen simultaneously (via overlay); he can bring east and west together (through Vivian Wu and Ewan McGregor); and through the Japanese hieroglyph can bring together word and image – since the word is an image. _The Pillow Book_ may have the characteristic ‘violence’ motifs of a Greenaway film: it also has a curious – and curiously moving – utopian quality.

**Peter Greenaway on ‘The Pillow Book’**  
The visual language experiments of _Prospero’s Books_ are continued in  _The Pillow Book_. Neither has a guilty conscience about putting the word ‘book’ in their titles, if only because this demonstrates the equivocations of a film tradition that always starts with text before it moves on to image, which seems to suggest filmmaking as an illustration of text. There are various symmetries. The first film was developed from Shakespeare’s _The Tempest_, a 400-year-old classic English text, the second from a 1000-year-old classic Japanese text, Sei Shonagon’s _The Pillow Book_. But unlike _Prospero’s Books_, the second is a contemporary story with opportunities to open up new strategies and structures which the first deliberately kept under a tight discipline.

The overall visual metaphor for _The Pillow Book_ is the oriental hieroglyph as a template for a cinema practice. The history of Japanese calligraphy is also the history of Japanese painting. Image and text are one. The text is read though the image, and the image is seen in the text – very possibly an ideal model for cinema, considering the uneasy marriage of text and image that it tries to cement. With the Japanese hieroglyph predominantly in mind as a model – more sinuous, more painterly perhaps than any other in the Orient – the subject of such a film would most naturally be Japanese.

To develop a contemporary story on an ancient calligraphic tradition, the language used must necessarily be very old and very new: 2000 years of calligraphic marks and ten years of computer visual invention, and a century of cinematic vocabulary. There are three particular areas of comparatively new concern: multiple screens, deconstructed chronology and a persistent changing of screen ratio.

These visual language devices are becoming familiar on television: insert frames, overlay frames, colour-coded frames, overlaid text, multiple use of text and image. All these have been major characteristics of all forms of visual advertising for some time. But their extended use, to service and structure a narrative feature film, is not at all common. _The Pillow Book_ tries to engage in this multiple language using a content that is sympathetic and relevant to such treatment. Here the form and the content in this case seem meant for each other; this is a film about ‘you are what you read’, ‘your life is an open page’, ‘I can read you like a book’. And every effort has been made always to find a rationale to bind language to content, as image and text are bound together in the Oriental hieroglyph, and never to succumb to the seduction of a purely decorative use of such potential, nor to shy from the Pleasure Principle.

The narrative demands a mixture of tenses, and the insert-frames and multiple screens can embrace images of past, present and future, not sequentially as is traditional, but all at once, arranging them in significant patterns of scale, priority, importance and colour: not necessarily in clear demarcated blocks but overlaid or interlaced to make equivalents to how we perceive time and tense. And the frame priorities can be arranged to accommodate irony, humour and criticism – to use the typical Godardian facility to make the important visually small and the trivial overwhelmingly large, or to make sleight-of-hand travel slowly, revealing the cheat as its apparent effect is demonstrated in real time. This is all arranged on one viewing plane, for an audience to make appraisal and comparison – a reach-out towards the freedoms and language that Cubism and Joyce and Eliot gave to Modernism, a movement and a philosophy and a way of construction that seems to have entirely bypassed cinema. Or maybe cinema has willingly bypassed Modernism.

Using other possibilities of the complex frame construction, referential visual quotes are made of East and West, of the old and the new; in particular the dominant Western tradition of the Renaissance viewing-frame and that of the largely unframed Oriental picture space: the scroll and the hanging vertical ‘picture’, or the ‘un-edged’ vistas of folding screens and ‘endless’ wraparound landscapes of Oriental ceramics, and the insert-vignettes of Japanese prints. The film borrows the device of the calligraphic chop-signatures [the personalised stamp-marks that identified a particular calligraphic artist], for making imprimaturs of other kinds. These it uses to negotiate conflicting Western left-to-right and Eastern right-to-left readings. The Western left-to-right reading indicates positive action, spelling confusion to any true reading of Japanese text and image combinations, while the Eastern right-to-left reading seems unbalanced to a Western sensibility, uncorrectable in a mirror and even morally confusing (especially if we believe that, in the West, evil enters stage-right).

One hopes the film to be full of such attempts to marry form and content, under the banner of the example of the hieroglyph that unites image and text. The images that are here are not necessarily the most imaginative in this area, but all contribute something to the idea of making the search.
