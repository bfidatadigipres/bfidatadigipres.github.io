_+ Q&A with directors Peter Baynton and Charlie Mackesy, and producer Cara Speller_

When Charlie Mackesy published his book _The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse_ in October 2019, he started a sensation. Inspired by drawings he’d first posted on Instagram, this fable-like tale of kindness and hope became an instant classic. It spent over 100 weeks on the _Sunday Times_ Bestsellers List, becoming the biggest selling adult hardback since records began.

While the book’s unique illustrations hinted it would be ideal to forge an animated film, Mackesy, modestly, couldn’t envisage it. ‘I’d hoped it would,’ he confesses, ‘but you don’t imagine your little story will come to a film, do you? We all have pipedreams, but they don’t necessarily come to reality.’ And yet together with his close friend, Matthew Freud, he set out to make it happen.

Despite fielding ‘a lot of offers’ for the screen rights, Mackesy and Freud were determined to do it right. ‘We wanted to do it ourselves really,’ explains Mackesy. ‘Keep the message as simple and as close to the book as possible.’ Cara Speller, an Emmy award-winning, Academy Award-nominated producer, with a strong background in animation, felt the same. She read the book in November 2019 and immediately set up a meeting with Mackesy and Freud.

‘I spoke very earnestly about how much I wanted to turn this into a film and how beautiful I thought it could be,’ Speller reveals, ‘and how I wanted to create an environment where Charlie was at the centre of everything, of all the decisions on the film, and the creative vision on the film. And I think that appealed to Matthew and Charlie.’

Mackesy was intrigued. After beginning his career as a cartoonist on  _The Spectator_ before exploring work in fine art and sculpture, his abilities as an artist were beyond question, but he had no experience in animation. Jumping into this world would mean not only adapting his book for the screen, but directing the animators, auditioning actors and much more. ‘It was from nothing to full immersion, which is quite a shock,’ he laughs. Thankfully, adds Speller: ‘He’s a very quick learner.’

Rapidly, the team came together, with Speller’s NoneMore Productions joined by J.J. Abrams and Hannah Minghella of Bad Robot Productions. Minghella explains ‘We started talking about the story and the approach to the film right after the world had shut down due to the pandemic. I think for all of us, escaping into Charlie’s world was a source of great comfort. I found myself drawing strength and hope and inspiration from Charlie’s words on a daily basis and our weekly meetings were truly a bright light in an otherwise dark time.’ The film was also set to be executive produced by former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and acclaimed Academy Award-winning actor Woody Harrelson.

Out of necessity, the team decided to bring an experienced director onto the project to work with Mackesy. Speller called Peter Baynton, who had previously been the animation director on the charming 2019 adaptation of Judith Kerr’s book _The Tiger Who Came to Tea_. ‘They felt that I would be a good person to just literally talk to Charlie about the process, and what that might be,’ says Baynton. In October 2020, Baynton and Speller paid Mackesy a visit. ‘We spent a day together in Charlie’s garden, just talking about all sorts,’ says Baynton. ‘We listened to the audio book, which he’d just finished. And we talked about the characters and what the film could possibly be.’

One of the difficulties of adapting _The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse_ is its lack of a traditional narrative. ‘I would say it’s journey, a story of a journey into a relationship,’ says Mackesy. In it, a young boy befriends a cake-loving mole, a wary fox, and a wise horse. As they progress through a snow-covered landscape, they exchange words of wisdom; maxims like ‘Being kind to yourself is one of the greatest kindnesses.’

It’s touching sentiments like these that turned the book into a phenomenon, particularly at a time when the world was enduring a global pandemic. And yet necessarily, a film needs a more rigid structure. Working with writer Jon Croker, whose credits include the beloved family film _Paddington 2_, Mackesy began to shape the screenplay. ‘I think the film has more of a narrative in it,’ he says. ‘It’s more linear than the book. The film has a definite purpose which is to find the boy a home. He declares at the beginning that he’s lost. In the book he doesn’t. He just hangs out with them.’ Minghella adds: ‘We discussed many different ways to start the film, many different ways to frame it. But any time it started to feel like we were giving too much specificity to the circumstances of the story, the characters or the world, it worked against the magic of the book which allows every reader to see themselves in the Boy or the Mole or the Fox or the Horse.’

**Peter Baynton – Director**  
Peter is an award-winning director of animated films.He has been obsessed with drawing pictures that tell stories since he was a kid. After a brief foray into architecture, where he learnt his buildings would be neither safe nor tasteful, he decided to learn the craft of character animation instead, studying at Central St Martin’s in London.His first film after graduating, _Over the Hill,_ won The McLaren Award for Best British Animation, and he was selected by Screen International as a UK Star of Tomorrow. He has been directing animated shorts, music promos and commercials for 14 years since then, and has picked up over 30 awards at film festivals around the world along the way, including an Annecy Crystal in 2013 and a couple of British Animation Awards. After years of making shorts and commercials, in 2015 he decided to follow his heart and pursue longer form animation, working as a storyboard artist on the BAFTA winning CBeebies show _Sarah & Duck_, and then as 2D Animation Director for _Paddington 2_. In 2019 he was Animation Director for C4’s Emmy award-winning _The Tiger Who Came to Tea._ In 2020 he started working on a film of Charlie Mackesy’s beloved book _The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse_ with NoneMore Productions, and directing this film with Charlie has been the greatest privilege of his professional life. He is now in the early stages of directing a feature film for Lupus Films Ltd, to be released in 2024.
