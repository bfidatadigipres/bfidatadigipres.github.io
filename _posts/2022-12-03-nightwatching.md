Like Nicolas Roeg and Ken Russell, Peter Greenaway is a cinematic adventurist who for several decades wowed the British arthouse with a succession of challenging and deeply idiosyncratic films, only to slip out of favour and in effect disappear from public awareness. Given that none of his film projects – not even the epic _The Tulse Luper Suitcases_ trilogy (2003-04) – has been released either in UK theatres or for the UK home market in the decade since his _8½ Women_ (1999), _Nightwatching_ represents something of a comeback, though it seems a further sign of his fall from grace that even this film has taken over two years to reach our screens following its 2007 completion.

How appropriate, then, that _Nightwatching_ should focus on an artist who, like Greenaway himself, found his coded, carnivalesque works first winning him approval and then driving him to the margins. In 1642, at the peak of his career, Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn (an earthy Martin Freeman) reluctantly agrees to create a group portrait of the Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq (later known as The Night Watch) but imports into his picture cryptic clues to the peccadilloes, hypocrisies and even murderous plots of his subjects, so engendering his own ruin – and incidentally inventing a new kind of art which, in its strikingly dramatic postures and chiaroscuro effects, is a forerunner of cinema itself.

Here, conversely, Greenaway’s cinema has been styled to resemble no less than a work by the Dutch master. Every scene is staged with overt artifice, lit to accentuate the long shadows and framed like a _tableau vivant_ (often in imitation of specific paintings), while Rembrandt alone, much like the figure of himself he concealed in the background of _The Night Watch_, occasionally looks directly at the viewer (and speaks to camera), uniquely aware that he is an object of both spectacle and narrative. This is a portrait of an artist at work, in love and in lust – but it also offers a radical reinterpretation of the painting as an allegorical cipher for crimes and conspiracies carried out by the Militia itself, which comprised Amsterdam’s cultural, spiritual and economic élites. It is a theory that Greenaway would resume and expand in his next feature, the film essay _Rembrandt’s J’accuse_ (2008), which should be viewed with _Nightwatching_ as a diptych.

This is a work that bears the unmistakable signature of its creator. There are all the usual Greenaway obsessions with witty wordplay, sexual/political power games and the effects of light on a roomful of objects. The idea of art framing murder can be traced all the way back to Greenaway’s _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ (1982), while the character of Marieke (Natalie Press) – the abused orphan befriended on the roof by a ‘nightwatching’ Rembrandt – clearly resembles, in her appearance, manner of speaking and interest in the night sky, the ‘skipping girl’ (Natalie Morse) from _Drowning by Numbers_ (1988). Perhaps the real question is not so much whether _Nightwatching_ represents a return to form for Greenaway, but rather whether such form has any place in today’s cinemas. Nostalgic fans of the director are likely to get exactly what they want from _Nightwatching_ – but for all its experimentation, intellectualism and intricacy, it has little to offer that’s new. Perhaps, though, this is an unfair criticism of a film that in fact invites us to look again, with unblinkered eyes, at the old.
