_+ Q&A with James Norton, Siobhan Finneran, Will Johnston and Jessica Taylor_

Sally Wainwright’s multi-BAFTA award winning hit _Happy Valley_ features Sarah Lancashire in her iconic role of Sergeant Catherine Cawood.

When Catherine discovers the remains of a gangland murder victim in a drained reservoir, it sparks a chain of events that leads her straight back to Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton). Her grandson, Ryan (Rhys Connah), is now sixteen and has ideas of his own about the kind of relationship he wants to have with the man Catherine refuses to acknowledge as his father, leaving Catherine’s sister Clare (Siobhan Finneran) caught in the middle. In another part of the valley, a local pharmacist gets in over his head when a neighbour is arrested.

_Happy Valley_ series three (6x60’) is a Lookout Point production for BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Executive producers are Sally Wainwright and Sarah Lancashire, with Faith Penhale and Will Johnston for Lookout Point, Ben Irving and Rebecca Ferguson for the BBC. In advance of series three, the first two series of _Happy Valley_ are available to watch on BBC iPlayer now.

**James Norton** is an acclaimed stage and screen actor and producer with credits including Agnieszka Holland’s _Mr Jones_, _McMafia_, _Black Mirror_,  _The Trial of Christine Keeler_, _Grantchester_ and Sally Wainwright’s seminal crime drama _Happy Valley_ for which he earned a BAFTA TV nomination. In 2021, Norton was nominated at the British Independent Film Awards for his performance in _Nowhere Special_, playing a single father with terminal cancer and most recently he produced and starred opposite Gemma Arteron in Netflix thriller, _Rogue Agent_.

In 2005, Finneran originated the lead female role in the stage play _On the Shore of the Wide World_ and was awarded the Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

Later film credits include  Mrs Swift in the 2013 film release, _The Selfish Giant_, which earned her a British Independent Film Award nomination.
