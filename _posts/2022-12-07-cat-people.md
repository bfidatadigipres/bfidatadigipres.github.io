Everyone agrees that the title came first: _Cat People_.

In March 1942, Russian-born Val Lewton – formerly a pulp novelist, pornographer, publicist, story editor and second-unit producer – left a job with independent David O. Selznick and joined RKO Pictures as a producer. RKO had taken something of a pasting in Hollywood for their sponsorship of Orson Welles, which had led to the astonishing but financially unrewarding _Citizen Kane_ (1941). Replacing vice-president in charge of production George Schaefer, who had brought Welles aboard, was Charles Koerner, who came over from the exhibition side of the business and was charged with executing the studio’s new-minted policy of ‘showmanship, not genius.’

At RKO, Lewton began assembling a team, depending heavily on his contacts from the Selznick organisation: director Jacques Tourneur, with whom he had worked on the second unit of _A Tale of Two Cities_ (1935), and writer DeWitt Bodeen, who had been a research assistant to Aldous Huxley on a _Jane Eyre_ script that eventually became the 1944 film with Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. They tell slightly different stories of how _Cat People_ came to be. According to Tourneur, ‘Val Lewton called me up at RKO one day and said “Jacques, I’m going to produce a new picture here, and I’d like you to direct it.” He said, “The head of the studio, Charles Koerner, was at a party last night and somebody suggested to him, ‘Why don’t you make a picture called _Cat_ _People_?’ And Charlie Koerner said to Lewton, “I thought about it all night and it kind of bothered me.” So he called in Lewton and asked him to make the picture. Tourneur later added ‘Val said: “I don’t know what to do.” It was a stupid title and Val, with his good taste, said that the only way to do it was not to make the blood-and-thunder cheap horror movie that the studio expected but something intelligent and in good taste.’

Bodeen’s version is that ‘Val departed for RKO two weeks before I’d finished my work at Selznick’s, and when I phoned him, as I had promised, he quickly made arrangements for me to be hired at RKO as a contract writer at the Guild minimum, which was then $75 a week. When I reported for work, he ran off for me some US and British horror and suspense movies which were typical of what he did not want to do. We spent several days talking about subjects for the first script. Mr Koerner, who had personally welcomed me on my first day at the studio, was of the opinion that vampires, werewolves and manmade monsters had been over-exploited and that “nobody has done much with cats.” He added that he had successfully audience-tested a title he considered highly exploitable – _Cat People_. “Let’s see what you can do with that,” he ordered. When we were back in his office, Val looked at me glumly and said: “There’s no helping it – we’re stuck with that title. If you want to get out now, I won’t hold it against you.”

The oddest thing Bodeen, Tourneur and all Lewton commentators insist on is a contempt for the title. Bodeen has Lewton in despair giving him a chance to walk away from such an absurdly-titled project while Tourneur – whose credits at the time included _Nick Carter, Master Detective_ (1939), _Phantom Raiders_ (1940) and _Doctors Don’t Tell_ (1941) – simply sneers at such a ‘stupid title’. What, pray, was a cat/werewolf horror movie supposed to be called? _Remembrance of Things Past_? _Cat People_ seems a simple, evocative, eerie title rather than a 1942 precursor to _Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster_ (1965), _Blood Orgy of the She Devils_ (1973) or _Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator_ (1989). It marks out its territory perfectly, affords both a literal and a metaphoric reading (it’s not called _The Cat Woman_) and has a resonance that remains 60 years on.

_Cat People_ is not – though many commentators have said it is or ought to be – a respectable psychological study of a woman with a neurosis; _Cat People_ is a horror film about a woman who turns into a panther. Too much writing about Val Lewton is embarrassed that such a tasteful man should have made horror pictures, and many of the anecdotes about its making suggest some tension between a philistine front office eager for a lurid cat werewolf movie and a daring band of filmmakers intent on slipping them a serious film about psychiatry instead. Lewton himself made his intentions clear in his early notes about the character of Dr Judd, whom he planned as:

‘A man, possibly a doctor, who always gives the scientific or factual explanations for any phenomena that occur, brushing the supernatural aside, and yet, who is always proved wrong by the events on the screen. This device, I hope, will express the audiences’ doubts even before they are fully formulated in their minds and quickly answer them, thus lending a degree of credibility to the yarn, which is going to be difficult to achieve.’

The innovation of _Cat People_ was not ambiguity – which often in horror films serves merely as a respectable get-out clause, allowing audiences who don’t recognise the validity of supernatural stories to read fantastical events as symptoms of a deranged mind (cf., _The Innocents_, 1961) – but subtlety. Lewton decreed:

‘We tossed away the horror formula right from the beginning. No grisly stuff for us. No mask-like faces hardly human, with gnashing teeth and hair standing on end. No creaking physical manifestations. No horror piled on horror. You can’t keep up horror that’s long sustained. It becomes something to laugh at. But take a sweet love story, or a story of sexual antagonisms, about people like the rest of us, not freaks, and cut in your horror here and there by suggestion, and you’ve got something. Anyhow, we think you have. That’s the way to do it.’

For Lewton, the special-effects lycanthropy of _The Wolf Man_ simply wasn’t frightening enough, and the domestication of the Universal Monsters into well-loved children’s figures suggests that he was right. Though Irena never sports yak-hair and fangs, _Cat People_ is unambiguous about her status: the film’s last line (‘she never lied to us’), along with details like transforming footprints and a shredded bathrobe, prove that Irena really is a Cat Person: Dr Judd interprets what she tells him as a childhood trauma, but we are supposed to understand what really happened before Irena was born: her father made love to her mother in the forest, impregnating her, and she transformed into a panther and killed him. The lesson is not that a psychological study is more worthy than a cat werewolf movie, but that a horror film can have psychological depth. That Irena is a cat person doesn’t make the film any less affecting as the story of a troubled marriage.
