_+ extended intro by Peter Greenaway (Saturday 10 December screening only)_

Peter Greenaway, one of the most inventive, ambitious and controversial filmmakers of our time, returns to the cinematic arena of _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ in a film that brilliantly showcases his legendary trademarks for breathtaking visual framing and provocative subject matters.

Winner of Best Film Out of Official Competition at the Rome Film Festival, Greenaway’s latest feature explores the life of celebrated 16th century Dutch painter, printer and engraver, Hendrik Goltzius, and is his second biopic on Dutch Masters after _Nightwatching_.

Greenaway’s film is based on the trip taken by Hendrik Goltzius in 1590 to Colmar in Alsace to find finance to support his printmaking business in  The Hague.

‘I had a little trading company. The Pelican Company. Engravers, printers, an actor or two. All of us specialised in words. We traded in words. Words in books. Words on the stage. I wanted to make pictures as well as words. Pictures in books. Pictures on the stage.’

Goltzius, played by the Dutch poet and actor, Ramsey Nasr – since 2009, Poet Laureate of the Netherlands – makes a contract with the local governor, the Margrave of Alsace, played by American Oscar-winning actor, F. Murray Abraham, to make a set of 50 illustrated volumes of the erotic stories of the Bible in return for cash payments and, most significantly, for the presentation at his court of six biblical erotic dramas acted out by his company of printers  and actors.

‘We conceive of producing an illustrated Old Testament with the familiar moral stories told with a singular new freedom.’

‘In other words “dirty books”? How much?’

The six presentations are based on the all-time prohibitive taboos of Voyeurism, Incest, Adultery, Paedophilia, Prostitution and Necrophilia, dramatised through the stories of Adam and Eve, Lot and His Daughters, David and Bathsheba, Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife, Samson and Delilah, and from the New Testament, Salome and John the Baptist.

The Alsatian court and the Dutch company, arguing political and religious difficulties in a Europe divided so recently into Catholic and Protestant camps, become embroiled in a drama of freedom of speech and freedom of ideas that destroys the Margrave and activates the commission.

Since Goltzius’s occupation is printmaking and engraving, the drama is enacted very self-consciously through the business of visual representation both of the late 16th century and of now. Goltzius, in 1600, commentating on his own adventures of ten years before, says:

‘Every new visual technology is expensive. And every new visual technology, sooner or later, gets into bed with lechery.’

Such a statement in 1600 would not at all be irrelevant when applied to much contemporary activity in photography, cinema and the Internet.

**Director’s Comment**  
It is a curiosity that every new visual technology in its infancy seems to gravitate towards erotica and pornography – oil painting in the 1520s, photography in the 1840s, cinema in the 1900s, the Internet in the 1980s and Second Life in the 2000s. Is it a flagrant demand for attention, a cynical attempt to attract funding, or a real curiosity to see what that attention-puller of all time – sex – will look like in a new visual language?

This same characteristic could be said to apply to the newly enhanced technology of the visual imagination of the 1590s – the printed metal engraving. And perhaps its major practitioner at that time was Hendrik Goltzius, Dutch master-printer with a damaged right hand, whose mastery of the burin was unrivalled across Europe. It helped of course that the current fashion in visual imagery was the Mannerist enthusiasm for the nude in every conceivable position, contortion and exhibitionist display that could be imagined.

As with all new technologies, the new and often experimental equipment involved was expensive, and the makers had to persuade, coerce, beg, plead, bribe and fight to find the funding to support it.

_Goltzius and the Pelican Company_ is the story of the Dutch engraver Hendrik Goltzius persuading one of the petty German princelings of Europe to pay for an expensive printing press to make a limited deluxe edition of a boldly illustrated Old Testament. And like a good advertising executive hoping to clinch a deal, Goltzius is prepared to sweeten his offer by getting his Pelican Printing Company from The Hague to fulsomely dramatise six erotic biblical tales that demonstrate the six sexual taboos – voyeurism, incest, adultery, paedophilia, prostitution and necrophilia. They start with the very first copulation tutored by Satan on Adam and Eve and continue with the story of Lot and his daughters, the adultery of David and Bathsheba, the seduction of the under-aged Joseph by Potiphar’s wife, the demonisation and disloyalty of Delilah and the humiliation of Samson, finally skipping to the New Testament to finish with the tale of necrophilia of Salome and John the Baptist.

Since it is 1590 and Europe is about to plunge into savage and bitter religious wars, tensions are high in the German court striving for liberty of thought, but there is another more insistent and constant perpetual war that never ends, has few truces, no peace conferences and persistent aggression, and this is the never-to-be-resolved battle of religion and sex.
