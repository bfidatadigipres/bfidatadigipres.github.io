_+ intro and discussion._
Michael Caine plays Ebenezer Scrooge in this Christmas comedy favourite that appeals across the generations. The exuberant Muppets take on Dickens’ characters, offering their own perspective on the Victorian story, with smart dialogue and music from Paul Williams. Something to enjoy every time...
We will be presenting the full length version of this title at all screenings. This version includes the song When Love is Gone which was cut from the original theatrical release.
We are pleased that the screening and discussion afterwards will be hosted by Lillian Crawford, freelance film and culture writer and co-host of Autism Through Cinema Podcast.
