It’s Christmas at Button House, and Mike and Alison are heading to Mike’s parents to celebrate with family. Alison promises the Ghosts that they’ll be back by the evening and lets them know that each has a Christmas surprise in the Library. The Ghosts are touched and inspired to give Alison a special Christmas present to remember – but can they pull off their ambitious idea in time? The hit comedy show follows up its fourth series with this special Christmas episode. We will also be screening the 2020 Christmas episode  _The Ghost of Christmas_.

Lolly was included in the _Elle_ List’s 2019 50 Game-Changers of Now; _The Evening Standard_’s 2019 and 2018 Progress 1000 (the annual list of influential Londoners); and voted _The Observer_ (newspaper) Rising Star of Comedy.
