Bill Murray’s Frank Cross is a modern-day Scrooge. An unpleasant TV executive, he pushes his team to the limit when he plans a live production of _A Christmas Carol_ on Christmas Eve, expecting them to forego any celebration so they can achieve his aims. The spirit of his unpopular mentor visits him before a trio of ghosts appear over the course of one night. But will they be enough to put Frank on the right path? One of the most underrated Christmas films, _Scrooged_ has gradually built up a cult following and now ranks as a Christmas favourite.  
**bfi.org.uk**  

Every child has seen _Mickey’s Christmas Carol_, if he/she has not actually listened to an audio tape of some notable reading the original, and in this respect _Scrooged_ is unlikely to disappoint: the plot, of course, is fireproof and the filmmakers’ tone spot on. The longsuffering Bob has become a black secretary, better paid than Scrooge’s clerk, one imagines, though no less indispensable and no less intimidated. Claire (Karen Allen), open, freckle-faced and trusting, is an equally willing doormat; as is James Cross (played by the star’s own brother) who year after year suffers with stomach-turning forbearance Frank’s slights. The syrup, including, of course, Claire’s philanthropic work at the derelicts’ hostel, is spooned on with gusto; and only occasionally – for example, when father Cross the butcher slings a parcel of veal on his son’s lap as a Christmas present – is one reminded that the writers are something more than pasticheurs.

The live Christmas special has the improbable Buddy Hackett as Scrooge, John Houseman in a burgundy dressing-gown, and a female Tiny Tim who back-flips rather than hobbles on set; the script calls for a mouse with miniature reindeer antlers, a difficulty which Frank suggests be solved with a stapler. A former long-hair now a captain of television, Frank Cross is played as a vivid, but appropriately two-dimensional Dickensian cypher, obsessed with the faintly sadistic pleasure of making heaps of money from the abhorrent sentimentality of Scrooge.

As a seasonal entertainment for children to whom _Nightmare on Elm Street_ is mother’s milk (and indeed for the rest of us), _Scrooged_ carefully treads a delicate line. The Ghost of Christmas Future opens his shroud and hobgoblins leer behind his rib cage; Christmas Present, on the other hand, a piping fairy with an ever-ready pair of fists, speaks of an older tradition brought not quite up to date. Richard Donner has on the whole wisely avoided a cruel or even sarcastic mockery of the easily mocked sentimentality. Like Old Brown, after all, the Spirit of Christmas will tolerate only so much tomfoolery.
