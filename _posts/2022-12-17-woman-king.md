_+ intro and Q&A_

The Agojie were an all-female unit of warriors who protected the African kingdom of Dahomey in the 1800s. The story follows the emotionally epic journey of General Nanisca who trains the next generation of recruits to defend their way of life and fight against enslavement.

Presented by Dr Michelle Asantewa, a member of the African Odysseys steering Committee, the screening will be followed by a discussion of its themes and treatment of African history.

There is a paradox in the kenning-like title of this latest feature from director Gina Prince-Bythewood (_Love & Basketball_, 2000; _The Secret Life of Bees_, 2008; _The Old Guard_, 2020). A ‘woman king’ is surely a queen – but unlike Shante (Jayme Lawson), the chief consort to King Ghezo (John Boyega) and a woman who very much desires the luxurious, sheltered life of a conventional queen, the Agojie, a group whose very name means ‘king’s wives’, in no way conform to the expectations of their gender: they are the king’s female guard, preferring the hardship and discipline of a warrior’s life to the sex, marriage, baby-making and domestic servitude that would otherwise be their lot. ‘Woman King’, it will emerge, is a near-mythical status conferred upon a woman whom the king regards as his equal in counsel and vision. Equality, however, is an elusive idea here, under constant negotiation.

There are other contradictions. For while _The Woman King_ is set in a particular time and place – the West African Kingdom of Dahomey in 1823 – and while Ghezo was an actual king and the Agojie were an actual fighting force under him, other characters are more nebulous. The middle-aged Agojie general Nanisca (Viola Davis) is named after a real person, except that that person joined the ‘Dahomey Amazons’ as a teenager over half a century later, in 1889. Similarly, Nawi (Thuso Mbedu), the 19-year-old recruited to the Agojie after violently rejecting the older man her family has chosen to be her husband, is named after an actual woman said to have been the last surviving Agojie, who claimed to have fought as a teenager in the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892 (some 70 years after the film’s events), and who lived till 1979!

So Dana Stevens’ screenplay (from a story she wrote with Maria Bello) plays fast and loose with historical chronology, while even the recorded names Nanisca and Nawi are Anglicised versions, with no close equivalent in the local Fon language. Other characters, like Nanisca’s tough lieutenants Amenza (Sheila Atim) and Izogie (Lashana Lynch), or the Portuguese-Brazilian slaver Santo Ferreira (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and his half-Dahomean companion Malik (Jordan Bolger), are fictions (although Ghezo did have close relations with the Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa). Even as the film concedes from the outset the uncomfortable truth that the real Dahomey under Ghezo was no less actively involved in slave-trading than its enemy the Oyo Empire, it also implies that by the film’s end, such practices, at Nanisca’s urging, would soon be replaced with palm oil production – whereas in reality, Ghezo was still selling into slavery both captives from raids (often conducted by the Agojie) and even Dahomey’s own citizens till the end of his reign three decades later. Let’s not even mention the mass human sacrifices carried out annually in the Kingdom – after all, the film does not mention them.

None of this really matters. For with its rape-revenge plotting (Nanisca’s opposition to the Oyo general Oba Ade, played by Jimmy Odukoya, is deeply personal), its improbable reunion of a long-estranged mother and daughter, its emancipating romance and its exploits of derring-do, _The Woman King_ keeps reminding us that it is a myth, and that its play on history is exaggerated and idealised. Indeed, its empowered women have not a little in common with the all-female militia (in fact modelled on the Agojie) in Ryan Coogler’s _Black_ _Panther_ (2018) or the Amazon army in Patty Jenkins’ _Wonder Woman_ (2017), making this a sort of superhero story _avant la lettre_ set in an African past. Prince-Bythewood’s film is not so much accurately recreating the past as allegorising a timeless struggle – for liberation, for equality and for progress – and it creatively engenders a brief moment when men and women, white and Black, find an agreeable accommodation with each other and together overcome oppression.

Certainly _The Woman King_ is an adventure epic, full of vicious close-quarters battles and daring rescues, but it is also an exemplary intersectional feminist call to arms for the African sisterhood to keep building on the achievements of their female ancestors and to keep fighting – and dancing – as they did, or might have done, back in Dahomey, with or without the approval of their patriarch, in a film itself written, directed, shot and edited by an ensemble of women.

She taught English Literature, Editing and Creative Writing at London Metropolitan University and currently facilitates writing workshops as an Independent Scholar. She set up Way Wive Wordz Publishing, Editing and Tuition Services, an education platform to accommodate a range of learning and creative aspirations.

She lives in London. She writes a regular blog: waywivewordzspiritualcreative that highlights a range of cultural, educational, creative a spiritual experiences.

**Robin Walker**, also known as The Black History Man, is one of the UK's most pre-eminent African scholars. Born in London, Walker read economics at LSE before studying African World Studies under Dr Femi Biko and later Kenny Bakie. Since 1992 Robin has been lecturing in adult education, universities and conferences on African World Studies, Egyptology and Black History. Robin has authored or co-authored 13 books, including classic titles such as _Classical Splendour_, _Roots of Black History Sword_, _Seal and Koran_, the best study there has ever been on the Songhai Empire of West Africa (_Everyday life in a West African Empire_). Perhaps his most notable and critically acclaimed work is the title _When We Ruled_, which is hailed as the single most advanced historical synthesis on the history of Africa and its people to date. This established Walker as a leading authority on African studies in the English-speaking world.
