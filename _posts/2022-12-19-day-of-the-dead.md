**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
Although _Night of the Living Dead_ and _Dawn of the Dead_ were supposed to be the first two thirds of a trilogy, _Day of the Dead_ is not necessarily the final chapter of George A. Romero’s living-dead series. Loosely inspired by Richard Matheson’s novel _I Am Legend_, in which the old world is destroyed and replaced by a functioning society of the undead, the game plan was for _Night_ to deal with the beginnings of the holocaust, _Dawn_ to follow the complete breakdown of society, and _Day_ to depict a future world where living and dead have come to terms, and trained zombies fight wars on behalf of human masters who live in walled city states. The current film was facetiously announced as _Zombies in the White House_ – it closes on a shot of Sarah’s Crusoe-style home-made calendar as she marks off November 4th, election day – and should have ended (as does Romero’s unreleased-in-Britain _Knightriders_ and his projected version of Stephen King’s _The Stand_) with the establishment in the ruins of the old society of an ambiguously utopian new normality. However, given the need to release the film unrated in the U.S. in order to avoid the stigma of an ‘X’ rating, Romero had to abandon his elaborate original script for _Day of the Dead_ as economically unfeasible. Instead, he has backtracked in the history of the zombie apocalypse to the point when – following hints dropped in _Dawn_ – it is generally acknowledged that the living dead retain some species of conscious thought, and science in the shape of the Frankensteinian Dr Logan is pioneering the domestication of the zombie hordes.

_Day_ follows the earlier films in that it is a self-contained unit rather than a conventional sequel, so that the series gives the overall impression of three reports on isolated incidents in the larger story of the end of civilisation as we know it. As in _Night_ and _Dawn_, the most sympathetic and thoughtful (if not heroic) male character is Black, and the zombies are depicted in a less unpleasant light than the violent human characters (with the crazed militarists replacing the bikers, National Guardsmen and sheriff’s posses of the earlier episodes); and as in _Dawn_, the moral focus of the film is a woman who wants to do more than repeat the errors that seem to have brought about the crisis. Although no definite cause is given for the living dead plague (John has a slightly misjudged tirade which construes the zombies as the vengeance of God), Romero, through the character of Logan, does give further details of the rules by which the zombies live. In scenes which approach the gruesome humour of _Re-Animator_, Logan demonstrates his theories by pruning away an entire head except for the fragment of the brain that accounts for the urge to eat, and by disconnecting all internal organs in order to prove that the hunger impulse exists even when a zombie has no stomach to digest what it has eaten.

Throughout the series, Romero has been influenced by the black comedy and blacker worldview of the EC horror comics. In fact, he seems to have been working with the traditional EC plot (a villain commits more and more outrageous crimes, and is given an ironically apt comeuppance by supernatural means) all along, with American society cast in the role usually given to an individually hateable character and suffering its just desserts in the shape of the living dead, who are seen to mirror any number of vices: conservative complacency, consumerist frenzy, mindlessly instinctive political positions, pointless greed. Here, Romero scales down the story and gives us, in the thoroughly despicable Rhodes (one major confrontation scene has him threatening to shoot Sarah for refusing to sit down during his lecture to the assembled survivors, and his penchant for summary executions more than justifies his own fate) and his equally thuggish followers, actual individual bad guys who can stand in for greater evils and be graphically pulled apart in the style of EC’s famous gross-out last panels.

In the characters of Logan and Bub (brilliantly played by Richard Liberty and Howard Sherman), Romero also gives us authentic EC monsters – the scientist blathering about his theories and his personal problems, and giving schoolmasterish speeches to his tethered zombie test subjects (after one has misbehaved, he locks it up in the dark, ‘So you can think about what you’ve done’); the zombie half-remembering his pre-death life in the army with mocking salutes, pacified by Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ on a Sony Walkman, and finally pursuing His Master’s Killer in an implacable, shuffling chase sequence that is effectively a panel-for-panel reshoot of many of EC’s merciless poetic-justice finales. With the aid of make-up superstar Tom Savini, Romero has done a far better job than the Amicus anthologies ever did of visualising the comic/horrid fates of his villains: one’s head is turned into a gory bowling ball with eye-socket finger-holes; Rhodes is literally pulled apart, defiantly shouting ‘choke on ‘em’ to the zombies gobbling away at his intestines.

While the film owes much of its power to its gross pay-off, Romero has not neglected the serious side that has set his zombie films apart from those of his imitators. In fact, _Day of the Dead_ stands practically alone in the mid-80s as a fundamentally non-comic horror film (compare _Re-Animator_, _The Evil Dead_, _Return of the Living Dead_, _Fright Night_, _House_, etc.) and – like _Dawn_ – has the wit to devote much of its running time to character development, oppressive atmosphere and pointed social comment. As in _Night_ and _Dawn_, there is an acute sense of claustrophobic discomfort about the stronghold in which the survivors are besieged – here a larger, purpose-built, more depressing bunker – and the feeling for explosive tensions and petty quarrels inflated to murderous feuds is cleverly played off against the larger, frequently forgotten threat of the zombies.

The film slips once or twice – Terry Alexander’s overdone Jamaican accent almost turns him into the modern equivalent of the superstitious Mantan Moreland or Willie Best characters in 40s zombie movies. But for the most part, Romero reveals not only his proven skills as a director of action and personal unease, but a command of poetically profane dialogue that ensures many of the dialogue scenes are more forcefully shocking than the special-effects horrors: in particular, the series of explicit and roundabout threats made by Rhodes and his men against Sarah, the only woman in the group, who is sexually unavailable thanks to her (deteriorating and plainly doomed) relationship with Miguel. After the disappointment of the lazy _Creepshow_, _Day of the Dead_ marks a return to form for Romero, the man who can claim almost single-handed to have reinvented the horror film for the post-1968 cinema.
