Described by Martin Scorsese as ‘A uniquely haunting film’ and once thought lost forever, _The Queen of Spades_ is the perfect horror tale for a winter’s day. It’s 1806 and in St Petersburg, Captain Suvorin (Anton Walbrook) refuses to partake in the fashionable card game of faro, infamous for fortunes being won and lost on the turn of a card. Instead, he purchases an old book that unveils supposedly true stories about people who have sold their souls for power or wealth. He becomes fascinated by one story, which he believes is about the now elderly Countess Ranevskaya (Edith Evans). Desperate to learn the secrets of her wealth, he starts to court her ward, Lizavyeta (Yvonne Mitchell). But danger lies ahead. Thorold Dickinson (_Gaslight_) does a fine job creating a sinister, claustrophobic atmosphere and adopts a variety of innovative techniques to create a sense of foreboding. This new restoration is the perfect winter’s day antidote to those needing a post-Christmas chill.<br>

It seems we’re finally witnessing some degree of posthumous restitution for the spectacular run of bad luck that afflicted one of Britain’s most talented directors. In a stop-start feature-directing career that was strikingly diverse and highly international, Thorold Dickinson (1903-1984) only managed to make nine films. One of his two best, _The Queen of Spades_ (1949) is finally emerging on DVD in the UK, with extras including an endorsement from one of his most eminent admirers, Martin Scorsese, who calls it ‘one of the few real classics of supernatural cinema’. If not actually lost, it’s been a mislaid treasure of British cinema, a giddyingly dynamic ‘art film’ _avant la lettre_ made on the margins of the British industry.

Based on Alexander Pushkin’s short story of 1833, _The Queen of Spades_ was conceived as a film long before Dickinson got involved. The script was written by Arthur Boys and Rodney Ackland for the Russian-born producer Anatole de Grunwald. Originally Ackland was to direct, but when he left at short notice the whole production was in danger of closing down. The film’s Austrian-born star Anton Walbrook, who knew Dickinson’s gift for melodramatic intensity from their work together on the director’s other masterpiece _Gaslight_ (1940), telephoned him on a Tuesday, asking him to start the following Monday. It was the kind of challenge Dickinson’s instincts responded to (on _Gaslight_ he’d had three weeks’ notice).

Dickinson inherited promising ingredients. The Boys-Ackland script was already an ambitious piece of work, though De Grunwald and Dickinson undertook major rewriting. The sets were conceived by the theatrical designer Oliver Messel; the cinematographer was the great Otto Heller, with whom Dickinson had worked on his first film _The High Command_. Walbrook, between _The Red Shoes_ (1948) and _La Ronde_ (1950), was on superb form as the Faustian anti-hero Herman Suvorin, an impoverished, envious captain of engineers ready to sell his soul to procure the secret of winning at cards. The cast also included two notable screen debuts, from Edith Evans – marvellous as the aged Countess Ranevskaya, reputed holder of that secret – and Yvonne Mitchell, as her put-upon young companion Lizaveta Ivanovna, the victim of Suvorin’s scheming. De Grunwald, meanwhile, guaranteed unusual Russian authenticity; he brought in the unforgettable rough-voiced Maroussia Dimitrevitch as the sensual gypsy singer in the officers’ den where the gambling scenes take place, with Russian ballerina Violetta Elvin as the gypsy dancer. Later Dickinson would get Georges Auric to write the film’s razor-sharp score.

Dickinson films this fable of thwarted ambition and intense desire with the pent-up force of years of frustration – and in a startlingly un-English, high Romantic style. The stiff upper lip, he quickly decided, didn’t work for 1815  St Petersburg. ‘We’ll go all out for flamboyance,’ he declared, ‘and see what the result is.’ It was hugely untimely – the film was booed at Cannes for so eschewing neo-realism – but 60 years on its attack, wit, economy, emotional intensity, inventive visual magnificence and auditory richness seem thrilling. Walbrook takes breath-taking chances as his character accelerates from resentful taciturnity to cunning manipulation to ecstatic overweening to total madness – and carries us with him all the way.

Dickinson, who began as an editor, shifts from scene to scene with intoxicating rapidity and impact, often with a drastic change in musical register (wild gypsy singing, an animated society waltz, a Russian Orthodox choir for the funeral, Gluck’s opera Orpheus and Eurydice). His camera moves with rare fluidity and eloquence, and as in _Gaslight_ the claustrophobically cluttered period detail in the compositions (with especially ingenious use of mirrors) is dramatically integrated, not mere decoration.

It’s a headlong tale of pacts with dark forces in which evil really seems palpable. As one nobleman in the film declares: ‘Evil is… a mighty force that is abroad in the world to take possession of men’s souls – if they will allow it to.’ Dickinson keeps it nicely ambiguous how far the story’s supernatural elements are products of superstition and Herman’s fevered imagination; but the vision is dark, poignant, even tragic. Watching this film makes it seem well-nigh tragic too that Dickinson only made one more feature in Britain, the cruelly underrated and equally unconventional _Secret People_ (1951) with Serge Reggiani, Valentina Cortese and a young Audrey Hepburn. But at least _The Queen of Spades_ can now take its rightful place in our newly enriched history of British cinema.<br>
