Kurosawa’s final film of the war years (in fact Japan surrendered while it was still being made) is the shortest of all his features. _They Who Step on the Tiger’s Tail_ (1945), running just under an hour, is taken from a popular _kabuki_ drama. Set in the late 12th century, it tells how the young general Yoshitsune, fleeing the murderous jealousy of his older brother, the shogun Yoritomo, arrives with his followers at a checkpoint manned by Yoritomo’s forces. The general’s followers, led by his steward Benkei, are dressed as Buddhist priests, while Yoshitsune himself is disguised as their porter. When the post commander, Togashi, suspects the ruse, Benkei pretends to find his ‘porter’ lazy and beats him. Though seeing through the trick, Togashi is so impressed by this bold defiance of feudal convention, and the loyalty that it evinces, that he lets the party through.

Given the stringent situation of the country, Kurosawa was allowed only a single set, the checkpoint post itself; the rest of the film had to be shot on location. He welcomed this stipulation, finding it made the film ‘much easier to shoot’. But he also made an anomalous change to the action: the casting of the comedian Kenichi Enomoto (known as Enoken) in the additional role of a real porter, aiming (he claimed) to ‘make the picture come alive’ – a move described by Donald Richie as ‘a bit like adding Jerry Lewis to the cast of _Hamlet’_. Whatever Kurosawa’s intentions, Enoken’s relentless gurning soon becomes tiresome; but the idea can be seen as a dry run for the far more successful use of the two greedy, cowardly peasants as a downmarket Greek chorus in _The Hidden Fortress_ (1958).

_Tiger’s Tail_, though completed in 1945, wasn’t released until 1952, under a blanket ban by the US Occupation authorities on all _jidai-geki_ (period films); they were held to be inherently ‘feudalistic’ and ‘reactionary’.
