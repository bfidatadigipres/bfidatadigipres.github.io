**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

I came to this one late, as I’d always been led to believe that it was one of David Lynch’s lesser works. Maybe it was the lack of expectation. But when I did finally see it, the film completely bowled me over. It’s predictably uncompromising, gloriously evoking the nightmare state, featuring _that_ phone call – perhaps Lynch’s most unnerving sequence – and with a final shot that maybe holds the key to the entire mystery of the narrative.  
**Mark Jenkin**  

The legend of Luis Buñuel’s collaboration with Salvador Dalí is that if either included an image or incident open to rational explanation or interpretation, it would be dropped. Yet _Un chien andalou_ (1928) and _L’Age d’or_ (1930) afford many meaningful readings. It may well be that with _Lost Highway,_ director David Lynch and co-screenwriter Barry Gifford – author of the novel _Wild at Heart_ – have succeeded where Buñuel and Dalí failed, creating an almost entirely meaningless, or perhaps senseless, ﬁlm.

A synopsis can only be tentative, since the ﬁlm delights in contradictory or unexplained events, fracturing narrative logic at every turn. While in Lynch’s _Blue Velvet_ (1986) and _Twin Peaks_ (1989-90) the _noir_ plots are surprisingly worked through and explained, _Lost Highway_ goes out of its way to be inexplicable. The twinning of Fred’s wife Renee and Mr Eddy’s moll Alice is impossible to rationalise as a _Vertigo_ (1958) imposture, a _High Plains Drifter_ (1972) resurrection or a _Mirror Images_ (1991) twin-sister exchange. As a photograph at one point demonstrates, Renee and Alice are sometimes separate and sometimes one. If this bothers you, then there is no way into or out of _Lost Highway_ for you.

The opening ‘Fred Madison’ section of the ﬁlm is so powerful that the ‘Pete Dayton’ sequence inevitably disappoints. Fred and Renee receive the videocassettes, each showing more as the camera gets closer to them. Then Fred encounters the mystery man – Robert Blake in Bela Lugosi make-up, delivering arguably the most frightening performance in 90s cinema – and by this point Lynch fulﬁls his declared intention to fashion ‘a 21st-century _noir_ horror ﬁlm’. He invests the Madisons’ house with shadows that, in Raymond Chandler’s phrase, betoken ‘something more than the night.’ Lynch has always excelled at sidesteps into pocket-sized universes – behind the radiator in _Eraserhead,_ within the Black Lodge in _Twin Peaks –_ but here he makes the simple shadowed corner into which Fred fades the most dreadful place his cinema has ever taken us.

Though the ﬁlm slackens off when Balthazar Getty takes over the lead, Bill Pullman, an older version of the characters previously played by Kyle MacLachlan, represents Lynchian Man at his most susceptible to the forces of darkness, as demonstrated in the astonishing ﬁrst encounter with the mystery man. More signiﬁcant, perhaps, is Fred’s explanation to the cops that he hates video cameras because ‘I like to remember things my own way … how I remember them, not necessarily the way they happened’. This whole ﬁlm is not necessarily the way things happened. The Fred/Pete transformation just about makes emotional sense in terms of the entrapment of the _noir_ hero within the narrative and the wiles of an eternally reborn _femme fatale;_ while the twinning and melding of Alice and Renee play perfectly, thanks to Patricia Arquette’s mastery of the art of holding back. But the ‘Pete Dayton’ section of _Lost Highway_ founders a little on its lack of speciﬁcity. Have Fred and Pete exchanged bodies, with Pete coming out of some limbo to usurp Fred’s place in the world (as Bob did with Agent Cooper in the last episode of _Twin_ _Peaks_?) Or has Fred transformed only into a _physical_ likeness of Pete, retaining his own memories and personality? Pete has his own skills at intuitive engine tuning – ‘The best goddamn ears in town’, Mr Eddy comments, patting the ﬁlm on the back for its consistently superb soundtrack, designed by Lynch himself – but he seems disturbed by Alice’s resemblance to Renee.

Fred Madison lives in a horror story where an ordinary life can be pulled apart because of a stray thought and none of the trappings of American success can offer more than illusory comfort. But Pete Dayton’s world is culled from the _noirs_ Gifford extemporises on in his distinctive book of movie reviews,  _The Devil Thumbs a Ride and Other Unforgettable Films._ The Pete scenes trot out _noir_ motifs – ﬂeeing lovers, double crosses, a fall-guy protagonist – as landmarks rather than events, but the potency of the Fred scenes is never entirely dissipated. Among the most disturbing moments in the ﬁlm are a terrifying phone call from Mr Eddy and the mystery man (lying together in suggestive darkness) to Pete, and later Alice’s reminiscence of being forced at gunpoint to strip for Mr Eddy (with Marilyn Manson proving against the odds that it is possible to outdo Screamin’ Jay Hawkins with a more demented rendition of ‘I Put a Spell on You’). Fred returns at a desert site where time has run backwards, so that the mystery man’s shack is ﬁrst seen in ﬂames and then de-explodes to wholeness. The last section of the ﬁlm, which jumbles elements from all that has gone before, is all momentum where most movies would be all explanation, fading out with the lost highway of the title (a stray phrase from Gifford’s novel _Night People,_ not a reference to Hank Williams) and a high-speed car chase into a desert darkness.

As always with Lynch, it is hard to distinguish between a ﬁctional universe created to force a reassessment of your relationship with the real one, and a personal world that suggests an unsympathetic interpretation of its creator’s feelings. The abused and murdered women of _Blue Velvet_ and _Twin Peaks_ are again featured, though there is more eroticising here of living bodies than of dead ones. However, when it comes to genuine ﬁlm fear – as opposed to Wes Craven’s rollercoaster scariness with pop-culture footnotes – Lynch’s is the only game in town. This is post-genre horror: playing down explicit shock, it works on the evocation of unease through subtle sounds and blaring doom metal, offering blurred moments that resolve brieﬂy into dreadful clarity. After 100 years of cinema, it is still possible to make a truly terrifying picture.

Andrew is a constant influence and inspiration. This film stands for all his work and is a distillation of everything I love about it; the exploitation of the creative potential of sound, the playful approach to reality and, above all, the joy and mischievousness that run through all his films. I’m very proud to have been labelled a fellow ‘shoddyist’ by the man himself.
