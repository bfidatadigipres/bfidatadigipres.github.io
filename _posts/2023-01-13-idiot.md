With his central metaphor of snow – the towering drifts that turn streets and houses into blind burrows where dark, scurrying figures, blanketed by the snow that never seems to stop falling, seek and momentarily find each other-Kurosawa instantly captures the essence of Dostoievsky’s novel: that sense of people as isolated units reaching helplessly out with their sympathies but unable to tear down the barriers of understanding and intention which separate them from peace of the soul.

He simplifies, of course, reducing most of the secondary characters to a single dimension and necessarily removing all of Dostoievsky’s acute social criticism – though some of the simplifications are perhaps explained by the fact that his original cut, never released, ran to 265 minutes – but manages to convey the interlocking despair of human relationships, quite magnificently, through a simple stylistic device: the triangular grouping in which, usually in monologue, one person explains, one listens intently, and the third, marginally excluded, is baffled by the spellbinding emotional waves he cannot quite grasp.

Used repeatedly, this geometrical composition leads almost mathematically to the extraordinary climax of the ice carnival – in itself an extraordinary visual conception with its swirling movement, torches flickering in the darkness and grotesque painted masks, all dominated by the huge ice sculpture of a brooding demon – where all the characters as though summoned by demonic invocation, converge tangentially, at different moments, upon the fixed point of the Idiot.

Yet for all its formality, _The Idiot_ seems to lie outside the Japanese visual tradition; indeed, it has been criticised for being neither Russian nor Japanese. Movement and gesture are hieratic and abruptly stylised, certainly (Donald Richie suggests, quite pertinently, that Setsuko Hara’s performance was probably modelled on Maria Casarès in _Orphée_), but there is a curious _décalage_ between sound and image, almost a feeling that the actors are playing in pantomime accompanied by invisible doubles speaking their lines. The strange almost oneiric effect is of watching a silent film and simultaneously listening to an operatic aria. There is, for instance, a superb moment near the beginning (the first appearance of the triangle) when Kameda and Akama get off the tram and pause by a shop window displaying a huge photograph of Taeko Nasu, on which the camera focuses; at each edge of the frame, reflected in the window as they stare at the photograph, are Kameda and Akama; and off-screen, the measured, hypnotic voice of the Idiot, drawing the camera irresistibly in towards the photograph to fathom the tale of suffering he has drawn from the depths of her eyes.

We are, literally, in a country of the soul, dark and inscrutable, watching these creatures suffering through their dark night in which we, suddenly and mysteriously, are somehow implicated at the end when Kameda returns and asks about Taeko: with Taeko lying dead in the next room Akama does not reply, he simply turns to the camera and stares, accusing, uncomprehending.

The fact that _The Idiot_, apart from being butchered by its producers, has been generally reviled the world over is one more reason for evoking Dreyer’s _Gertrud_, which it so oddly resembles. Strange, poetic, clearly very personal to Kurosawa, it is certainly one of his best films.
