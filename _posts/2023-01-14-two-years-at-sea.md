_The screening on Saturday 14 January will feature an intro and Q&A with  Mark Jenkin and Ben Rivers._

It’s the aesthetic, the grain, the flicker, the texture that draws me in. But it’s the complete lack of backstory that ensures I keep returning to this enigmatic masterpiece. What’s not to love about a Bolex-shot, 16mm black and white, hand-processed genre-bending portrait of personal contentment?  
**Mark Jenkin**

What could possibly appear more strange or uncanny to many of us today than silence, slow action and solitariness? As the world increasingly follows its fervour and civilisation clamours to keep up, irrational timeouts have cultivated our dreams and become the stuff of fantasy. For the past decade, London-based artist-filmmaker Ben Rivers has explored alternate worlds on this very earth via short films and gallery installations that offer up other ways of living and being. With an affection for utopian novels like Sir Francis Bacon’s _The New Atlantis_ and Mary Shelley’s _The Last Man_, and a recurring Ballardian sense of underlying urban dystopia, Rivers has consistently headed for the hills – fertile ground for his imagination, with atmospheric climes and textures ripe for recording on his 16mm Bolex camera.

Fêted internationally for his neo-ethnographic explorations of curious, hermetic existences – such as _Ah, Liberty_ (2008) and _Origins of the Species_ (2008) – and in some cases vanishing environments, as in _Sack Barrow_ (2011), Rivers has successfully extended his signature themes and style into long-form with _Two Years at Sea_, his mesmerising and award-winning feature debut. Revisiting the forest-dwelling subject of his earlier 14-minute film _This Is My Land_ (2006), Rivers observes Jake Williams, who lives alone with his black cat in the woods of Aberdeenshire, entirely off the grid, fulfilling daily rituals that sustain him and  his freedom.

While comparisons can and have been made with the films of Argentine auteur Lisandro Alonso (known for his portraits of solitary and strikingly silent men, especially his 2001 debut _La libertad_, with its pared-down cycle of working, eating, shitting and sleeping), _Two Years at Sea_ is less concerned with questioning the nature of freedom that attends manual work under an open sky, than with mythic time and the effect of the somewhat strange physical human imprint upon inhabited rural terrain. That Jake is filmed in Scope is unsurprising given Rivers’s previous use of the anamorphic lens, most auspiciously in his heady sci-fi featurette _Slow Action_ (2010), but here this lone man’s navigating of expansive spaces unapologetically conjures the sublime.

Jake is nameless, unidentified and nearly wordless in _Two Years at Sea_. Looking like a cross between a twinkly-eyed Father Time and an ancient Roman bust come to life with wild mane and bushy beard, he exists in an undetermined time and place electrified by a protean life force – thrillingly expressed through Rivers’s hand-processed, rich and moody monochromatic images – that’s completely at odds with today’s pace and rampant technological transformations. His is an analogue world, replete with audiocassettes and record player, pen and paper.

Little is revealed about Jake, apart from his amazingly eclectic taste in music (from Indian to Hawaiian honky-tonk and folk), which – in startling counterpoint to the pervasive quiet – is heard blaring from his truck or from the gramophone ingeniously rigged to the facade of his ramshackle house. Jake also has a penchant for quirky interventions into the landscape, such as hoisting a caravan up a tree as a sort of teetering trailer-park Futuro house. His gestures are jittery, joyful, impulsive and determined; the central mystery of his identity is both tempered and fuelled by time-worn photographs that emerge and fill the frame as interstitial transitions or chapter headings between scenes, telltale signs of a less  solitary past.

Despite its attenuated narrative elapsing over a few seasons and its long, lingering takes – some nearing ten minutes as we watch Jake float and fish on a makeshift raft in a neighbouring loch, or fade to black by the dimming light of a campfire – _Two Years at Sea_ is far from minimalist. The film itself is buoyed by a generosity of vision, spirit and affectionate humour that obviate austerity and further distinguish it from Alonso’s more Bressonian _La libertad_. The pulsating widescreen images  hover and surge with electrified meteorological detail, but also with bits of fusain-like dust and goopy watermarks that correspond to the messiness of Jake’s  heap-filled home.

With several caravans’ worth of belongings, in addition to the objects in his house, Jake is a pack rat whose ample, knick-knacky possessions crucially contribute to the film’s sculptural nature. With moments reminiscent of Gordon Matta-Clark’s filmic architectural cut-outs, _Two Years at Sea_ is a portrait of a sentient human being, but one that pays keen attention to the light cast from the forms and objects – and especially windows and walls – that surround Jake and his cat. ‘You can say as much filming some empty bottles on a shelf [as] you can hearing Jake talk about living in that place for the last 20 years,’ Rivers tells me in a phone interview.

Flouting the notion of an objective documentary image, Rivers refuses to provide his film with a label. ‘It’s up to other people to categorise the work,’ he insists. ‘So if a documentary festival wants to show it, that’s fine by me, but I’m not going to call it a documentary. I’m going to call it cinema. All cinema has varying levels of construction, and that’s what’s so interesting about it. I never set out to make a representation of Jake’s life. I set out to make a film which is very close to his life, but it’s a film that in the end exists for itself. In and for itself. And I think that’s a really crucial distinction.’

Citing the work of Robert Flaherty, Humphrey Jennings and even the Lumière brothers as examples where fiction and documentary meet and become intertwined, Rivers is less interested in discussing a cinema of the ‘in between’, though he’s very conscious of the fact that much of his work does indeed raise questions about the nature of ethnography, and purposely interrogates the genre. What he will say is that _Two Years at Sea_ is ‘an exaggeration of certain parts of Jake’s life’, stressing the collaborative working relationship between his subject and himself. Rivers scripted the film, but made alterations whenever Jake felt a task or action would be ‘out of character’. Asked why he chose to go back to Jake when an award from the Film London Artists’ Moving Image Network provided the impetus to work on his first feature, Rivers responds: ‘Jake was the first. Before I made _This Is My Land_, I had never considered making anything even closely resembling a documentary, or something that involved real people in their actual places. Everything before was constructed or made by myself. He holds a pretty important place in my filmmaking development.’

Setting some rules for himself at the outset, Rivers chose as a challenge to make a feature with a sole character and without dialogue as a way of creating cinema out of an alternate language in order to ‘immerse the viewer in a world atmospherically and with a different kind of intellectual engagement... a language of gestures and movements. There’s a language of the objects seen in the film, of space and of the way that space is constructed,’ he continues. ‘You can look at what he’s accumulated and see it as a kind of language built up to portray the person he is. From the things that one surrounds oneself with emerges the language of cinema.’

**A Portrait of Ga**  
The purest film included in this season. A camera, a voice, some music.  A beautiful and apparently simple portrait of a loved one, but also a love letter to the medium of film itself; a past-tense art form that shows us ghosts and freezes time. Truly transcendental filmmaking.
