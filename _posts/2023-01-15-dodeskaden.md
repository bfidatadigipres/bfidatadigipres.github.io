After five years’ absence, Kurosawa returned to the cinema with his first colour feature. It was also his first following the end of his collaboration with Toshiro Mifune and the archetypal superman/hero figure he often portrayed. Instead, we witness life among an ensemble of characters living together in a Tokyo slum. Kurosawa’s painterly skills come to the fore as he portrays their lives through striking imagery.

The least seen film of Kurosawa’s last quarter-century is also one of his most eccentric. Returning to the territory of _The Lower Depths_ (1957), the film is set in a shantytown growing out of a rubbish tip, whose inhabitants live life as it comes, either through stoic endurance of poverty or sexual abuse, or augmented with vividly realised fantasy.

The film’s onomatopoeic title sonically depicts the sound of an imaginary trolley car (an English rendition would be ‘Clickety-Clack’), though it’s the beggar’s increasingly elaborate mental pictures of his dream house that ultimately prove the most affecting.

It was Kurosawa’s first colour feature and it shows: his delight in experimenting with outlandish lighting, design and makeup effects recalls Orson Welles’ similar glee over the possibilities offered by RKO’s studio facilities.  
**Michael Brooke, _Sight and Sound_, May 2009**  

**A contemporary review**  
Kurosawa has said in an interview that Rokuchan ‘symbolises the artist, the cineaste who creates entirely by the power of his imagination, using as a means of communication the tramway, i.e. the cinema’. Certainly Rokuchan and the omniscient Tamba represent different aspects of the artist’s own vision. Tamba directly parallels the mysterious Old Man of _The Lower Depths_; and despite its different origins and Kurosawa’s insistence on the basic difference that _Dodes’ka-den_ is set in real, contemporary Japan, there is an immediate and evident link between his screen version of Gorki’s play, made thirteen years earlier, and this film. For one thing _The Lower Depths_ has clearly influenced the structure of the present scenario.

Yamamoto’s original work, _Town without Seasons_, was a cycle of quite separate stories, set in different periods. Kurosawa and his scenarists have ingeniously interwoven them into an integrated, contemporary panorama. Rather disconcertingly, Kurosawa said at the time he made the earlier film that he found _The Lower Depths_ ‘a very comic play’, and indeed built up a knockabout farce element in his otherwise very straight treatment of Gorki. Here, too, high comedy mingles easily with the pathos of the derelicts. The scene where Shima brings his office buddies home, only to be painfully humiliated by his wife-but is ready to assault them when they mildly sympathise with him – exactly catches the ambivalence between tragedy and farce.

Kurosawa’s reading both of Gorki and of Yamamoto quite evidently arises from his incorrigibly optimistic view of humanity. With all the physical deprivation and cruelty of their lives, each of the little groups in the film represents a different face of loyalty: the sake boy’s to the girl who tries to kill him, the child to the father who does, unwittingly, kill him; even the unfaithful wife who seeks reconciliation. This, and the simple fact of survival, is what links the characters and imbues Kurosawa’s human comedy with a sense of affirmation.

Even though the film is now 100 minutes shorter than its reputed original length of 224 minutes, the large cast of characters and the variety of action remain entirely coherent, cohesive and symmetrically balanced. It is achieved not so much by the technique of caricature (though Kurosawa has claimed his aim was to create a series of caricatures of different aspects of human character – ‘humours’ in the old sense – and that the acting style he imposed was directly influenced by the Kyogon vaudeville theatre of Japan) as by the economy and speed of impression, the precision with which a single stroke is made to count, that is associated with traditional Japanese graphic style. Above all, the film is indeed ‘graphic’.

It was Kurosawa’s first colour film, and he uses colour like a painter. The colours move from realism into fantasy: the faces of the sick beggar and his child become livid blues and greens and their dreams materialise in wild Dayglo colours; the houses of old petrol cans are multihued, and Kurosawa was fascinated by the magical colours that the rain produced from the chemically polluted soil of the dump where he was shooting on location. Even the sky and the sun, when they appear, turn out to be children’s drawings like those in Rokuchan’s hut; and when the real sun failed to shine for him, Kurosawa simply painted the shadows as he shot. Yet the unique and individual expressionist techniques of both images and acting in _Dodes’ ka-den_ never compromise the essential human quality and human optimism of the film, any more than they appear incongruous beside the sudden, wholly realistic images of the real riverside locations. The mature assurance and total originality of _Dodes’ ka-den_ (made on a shoestring for the company ‘The Four Musketeers’ which Kurosawa had formed with three other major directors) makes only the more tragic the inactivity of the rest of the decade since _Red Beard_.
