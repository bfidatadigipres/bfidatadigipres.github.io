Season co-programmers Asif Kapadia and Ian Haydn Smith will be joined by a guest speaker for this introduction event to discuss the key themes structuring the Kurosawa season and the films screening. While celebrating Kurosawa’s samurai and action films, they will also explore the less familiar elements that make this giant of cinema’s work so brilliant.

‘The term “giant” is used too often to describe artists. But in the case of Akira Kurosawa, we have one of the rare instances where the term fits.’(Martin Scorsese)

Like a gathering storm, much of Kurosawa’s cinema begins with a portent of the turbulence to come. But within his work lay a poetry – both in his visual style and the depth of his characters – and a fascinating exploration of Japanese culture past and present. And throughout, from his startlingly assured first feature _Sanshiro Sugata_ (1943) to the ruminative and often humorous tone of his last, _Mâdadayo_ (1993), the thoughts and actions of his characters, and the changes unfolding in the societies they live in, were reflected in the elements. The climate plays a key role within all of Kurosawa’s work. But there are also a variety of themes that run through his dramas. Rather than journey through his work chronologically, this season breaks up his filmography into six themes. All are indivisible, but by focussing on specific elements within each film it is hoped that Kurosawa’s brilliance will shine even brighter.

After a rewarding apprenticeship under Kajirô Yamamoto, whom he assisted on 17 features, Kurosawa made his feature debut in 1943 with _Sanshiro Sugata_. It’s a great starting point to enjoy the filmmaker’s style and to appreciate themes that would recur throughout his work, from exploring the teacher/student dynamic and the role of the hero to more existential inquiries. These films employ the structure of the family or professional lives to explore Japanese society and to probe the nature of power structures, cycles of violence in history and the role of myth within society. From his Shakespeare adaptations to his contemporary thrillers, Kurosawa earned the adulation of audiences and the admiration of filmmakers, with Federico Fellini describing him as ‘the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be’.

‘With a good script a good director can produce a masterpiece; with the same script a mediocre director can make a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can’t possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water. That is what makes a real movie. The script must be something that has the power to do this.’ (Akira Kurosawa)

‘Kurosawa has said that he could not possibly define his own style, that he does not know what it consists of, that it never occurs to him to think of it. While quite ready to talk about lenses, or acting, or the best kind of camera-dolly, he is unwilling to discuss meaning or aesthetics. Once I asked him what a certain scene was about. He said: “Well, if I could answer that, it wouldn’t have been necessary for me to have filmed the scene, would it?”‘  
(Donald Ritchie)

‘When I begin to consider a film project, I always have in mind a number of ideas that feel as if they would be the sort of thing I’d like to film. From among these one will suddenly germinate and begin to sprout; this will be the one I grasp and develop. I have never taken on a project offered to me by a producer or a production company. My films emerge from my own desire to say a particular thing at a particular time. The root of any film project for me is this inner need to express something. What nurtures this root and makes it grow into a tree is the script. What makes the tree bear flowers and fruit is the direction.’ (Akira Kurosawa)

‘He taught me practically everything I know, and it was he who first introduced me to myself as an actor.’ (Toshiro Mifune)

Kapadia’s debut feature _The Warrior_ (2001), starring the late Irrfan Khan, shot in the desert and Himalaya of India won BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a Director as well as being nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language.
