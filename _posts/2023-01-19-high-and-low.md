**SPOILER WARNING The following notes give away some of the plot.**  

Among his collaborators and crew, Akira Kurosawa was known as _kaze-otoko_ – ‘wind man’. (The nickname _tenno_ – ‘emperor’ – was wished on him by the Japanese press.) It’s not hard to see why. From the scuttering of windblown leaves that provides a dry, mocking ostinato to the dances of death in _Yojimbo_ (1961) to the pennants snapping and fluttering above the doomed armies of _Ran_ (1985), his characters are buffeted by winds of fate. But it’s not only wind. Throughout his work, weather plays such a determining role it almost becomes a character in its own right. In _Dersu Uzala_ (1975) the chief adversary is no human agency, but the vicious Siberian cold that all but kills the inexperienced Russian surveyor; the mists that drift around Cobweb Castle in _Throne of Blood_ (1957) seem emanations of the otherworldly forces that lure Lord Washizu (the film’s Macbeth figure) to his downfall. And no Kurosawa movie feels complete without at least one torrential downpour – most unforgettably in the 25-minute battle that climaxes _Seven Samurai_ (1954), with the swordsmen skidding and sliding in the mud and slashing wildly at the bandits as they canter by.

Interestingly, the one climatic extreme largely absent from Kurosawa’s period films is intense heat. It’s as though for him the world of the _Jidai-geki_ (period drama) operates at a cooler, more remote level. Heat he reserves for his present-day urban stories, presenting it as correlation of the social melt-down of post-1945 Japanese society, with endemic crime and corruption replacing feudal oppression as the country’s besetting disorder.

In three Kurosawa movies in particular, the scope and slant of the action are not just coloured, but virtually defined by an oppressive heatwave. The crime dramas _Stray Dog_ (1949) and _High and Low_ (1963), and the psychological drama _I Live in Fear_ (1955, are all pervaded by images of relentless, inescapable heat. Every character, male and female alike, is constantly dripping with sweat. Shirts stick wetly to backs, foreheads are mopped, hats and newspapers waved in futile quest of a breeze. Outside the sun beats pitilessly down on pedestrians inching along dusty, airless streets, hugging the walls to catch the least sliver of shade. Interiors scenes are nagged by the whine of electric fans, whose ineffectual clamour seems only to fray everyone’s tempers further.

It’s as if the heat in these films was not so much the cause as the end result of human aggression, a form of emotional global warming. Anger is the element in which almost everybody swims, with most of the characters operating somewhere along the scale from irascibility to outright fury. In this shortfused atmosphere, violence is the inevitable outcome, with the killer in the two crime movies an erupting boil on the unhealthy skin of society worse than others in degree, perhaps, but not in kind. In both films the pursuing detective comes to feel a perverse identity with his quarry, seeing him as the man he might all too easily have become.

But Kurosawa takes his heat imagery a stage further. In all three of these films a character makes a descent into hell. In the two crime movies he manages to survive and return; in I Live in Fear the protagonist descends into a mental hell of his own making and ends up trapped there forever, gazing at a nightmare vision of the world on fire.

_High and Low_, made 14 years after _Straw Dogi_, shows us a Japan growing prosperous and – it seems – healed from the wartime wounds. Some have even done well enough to be able to ignore the sweatbath of summer, living high above the urban sprawl of Yokohama in air-conditioned villas, well placed to catch any breezes that blow. One of these privileged individuals is Kingo Gonda (Mifune), a rich industrialist scheming to seize control of the ill-managed company he works for. At the crucial moment an attempt is made to kidnap his son. It’s bungled; the kidnappers mistakenly seize the boy’s playmate, son of Gonda’s chauffeur. But they still demand the same vast ransom, reckoning Gonda’s conscience will work in their favour. If he pays up his plans will collapse and his career will be ruined.

This dilemma, though, proves not to be what the film is about; it’s even something of a macguffin. Or perhaps a semi-guffin, since it preoccupies the first half of the movie. _High and Low_ makes the metaphor of a descent into hell even more explicit; in fact, the film’s Japanese title, _Tengoku to Jigoku_, literally means ‘heaven and hell’, and the action splits between these two locations. The first half of the film plays out in ‘Heaven’, Gonda’s luxurious villa, as he wrestles with his conscience, consults the police and finally decides to pay the money demanded. This section of the film is shot soberly; Kurosawa, foregoing his usual dynamic editing style and oblique angles, films in long, unbroken, meandering takes, giving precedence to the dialogue. We might almost be watching a filmed play.

Once the ransom’s paid and his career is ruined, Gonda virtually drops out of the action. The actual handover of the cash, a virtuoso four-minute sequence shot aboard a high-speed train in real time, acts as a midway interlude after which we descend into hell, following the police investigation through the grimy inferno of midsummer Yokohama. This soon becomes a murder hunt, since the kidnapper kills his accomplices to cover his tracks. In this half of the film Kurosawa reverts to the style of filmmaking we expect at this mid-stage of his career – restless, dynamic, fuelled by nervous tension, with a fast mobile camera, insistent cutting and swift horizontal wipes that speed the action and mirror the urgency of the police investigation. Led by Inspector Tokuro (Tatsuya Nakadai, Mifune’s chief opponent in _Yojimbo_ and later the star of _Kagemusha_, 1981, and _Ran_), the cops penetrate steadily down into the murky depths of society, to the sordid waterfront bars and heroin dens where the killer hunts for fresh victims, a far cry from Gonda’s elegant villa.

But we’re constantly reminded of that villa, perched high above the city in aloof seclusion. Every so often Kurosawa’s camera lifts from whatever grimy back alley the police are raking through, and there it sits, cool and white and far beyond the reach of the sweltering masses below. It’s precisely that contrast, in fact, that first impelled the kidnapper, an impoverished young intern, towards his crime – as he tells Gonda when they at last come face to face. ‘Your house looked like heaven,’ he says accusingly. ‘Hate made my life worth living.’

Here, as in _Stray Dog_, the cops find they’re starting to align themselves with the criminal, to share his viewpoint. ‘That house makes you angry,’ growls one of them, dusty and sweating, gesturing at Gonda’s villa, ‘as if it’s looking down on you.’ Once more it’s a moot point whether the soaring temperatures are the cause or the outcome of so much festering social resentment.
