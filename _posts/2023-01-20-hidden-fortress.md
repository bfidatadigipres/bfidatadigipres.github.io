If Kurosawa had proven himself skilled at subverting the conventions of Japanese genre filmmaking, with this hugely entertaining film he not only proved he could embrace a straightforward adventure, he showed he could beat most other filmmakers at their own game. His trump card was to foreground two lowly farmers. One of Kurosawa’s most influential films, it’s a rip-roaring ride.

A story of rival clans, hidden gold and a princess in distress, _The Hidden Fortress_ is a thrilling mix of fairy story and samurai action movie. It was Kurosawa’s first film shot in the widescreen process of Tohoscope, and he exploited this to the full in the film’s rich variety of landscape locations, including the slopes of Mount Fuji.

_The Hidden Fortress_ became Kurosawa’s biggest box office hit to date and won several awards, including the Golden Bear at the1959 Berlin Film Festival. Some twenty years on, the film’s influence would have even greater impact on world box offices, when George Lucas borrowed its plot for the first of his _Star Wars_ series.

This epic adventure, with its sweeping narrative and well-defined characters, is one of Kurosawa’s most accessible and rousing pictures. At times, it seems as if the director has made a Hollywood version of feudal Japan – the fire festival sequence resembles a big production number from a musical. But, what makes it interesting is Kurosawa’s observations on ancient Japanese society. For example, through the eyes of a cloistered princess (fleeing to safety with the mysterious General Rokurota, played by Toshiro Mifune) we witness religious rituals and the role of women in a male hierarchy. George Lucas cited _Hidden Fortress_ as his inspiration for _Star Wars_, with the two bungling, disreputable soldiers transformed into R2-D2 and C-3PO. An engrossing film.

**A contemporary review from 1959 Berlin Film Festival**  
Kurosawa’s _The Hidden Fortress_ erupted into the festival like a rhinoceros into a prairie of mild sheep. Never before has Kurosawa’s allegiance to John Ford been more apparent; this, one felt, was the definitive Eastern-Western. The story is simple: a Samurai in disguise is conducting a Princess in disguise through enemy lines. To render their passage less ostentatious, the Samurai enlists two peasants into their company with the promise of gold. The by-play of these deceitful, raucous peasants, acted in broad, antic Kabuki vein full of comic whoops and barks, forms the light relief in a series of hair-breadth escapes, dazzlingly choreographed sword fights and shock effects timed with a master’s instinct. There is one moment strongly recalling the appearance of the Indians in _Stagecoach_: the little band seems to have reached temporary security when from every fold in the innocent landscape a menacing army materialises.

The superior adventure film obviously lies close to Kurosawa’s heart, and his authority in the genre commands respect. Far below the stature of _Seven Samurai_ in its conception, _The Hidden Fortress_ is an example of a popular theme handled with such skill and enthusiasm as almost to disguise the fundamental lack of narrative distinction. Toshiro Mifune, stunningly athletic and as controlled as a panther, is the star.
