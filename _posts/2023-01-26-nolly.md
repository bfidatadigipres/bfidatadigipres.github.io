_+ Q&A with writer Russell T Davies, cast Helena Bonham Carter, Mark Gatiss and Augustus Prew, exec producer Nicola Shindler and director Peter Hoar. Chaired by Boyd Hilton._

Academy Award-nominated and BAFTA-winning actor Helena Bonham Carter (_The Crown, Enola Holmes 1 and 2, The King’s Speech, Harry Potter, Burton and Taylor_) stars as Noele (or Nolly to her friends), who was a legend in her own lifetime. As flame-haired widow Meg Richardson in the long-running soap opera _Crossroads_, she was one of the most famous people in Britain. Then in 1981, at the height of the show’s success and the peak of Nolly’s fame, she was axed without ceremony, without warning and with no explanation. With the boss’s words ‘all good things must come to an end’ ringing in her ears, Noele Gordon found herself thrown out of the show that was her life for over 18 years.

_Nolly_ is a bold exploration of how the establishment turns on women who refuse to play by the rules, the women it cannot understand and the women it fears. And, it is a love letter to a legend of television, and to the madcap soap she starred in. _Nolly_ is an outrageously fun and wildly entertaining ride through Noele Gordon’s most tumultuous years, and a sharp, affectionate and heartbreaking portrait of a forgotten icon.

_Nolly_ begins streaming on ITVX from 2 February.

**About the panel**

**Russell T Davies** was awarded the 2006 Dennis Potter Award at BAFTA for his writing services to television and an OBE in the Queen’s 2008 Birthday Honours list for services to drama.

Russell was born in Swansea in 1963. A graduate of Oxford University, he completed the BBC Director’s course before becoming a TV producer. He started writing whilst working in the Manchester department of Children’s BBC. He has created several award-winning series including the ground-breaking _Queer as Folk_, _Bob and Rose_ for which he won the British Comedy Award for Writer of the Year and Best Comedy Drama, _The Second Coming_ for which he won the RTS Award for Best Network Drama and Broadcast Award’s Best Single Drama. He went on to revive the classic British science fiction series _Doctor Who_ which received numerous awards and for which Russell won the BAFTA for Best Drama Series, and _Torchwood_ for which he won the BAFTA Cymru for Best Drama Series. He created the trilogy _Cucumber_, _Banana_ and _Tofu_ for which he won the BAFTA for Best Drama Writer and BPG Innovation Award in 2016. He adapted _A Very English Scandal_ on BBC One for which he won the Rose d’Or Award for Best Limited Series and TV Movie and Broadcast News Award for Drama of the Year 2018. He wrote the 6-part drama _Years and Years_ for BBC One/HBO starring Emma Thompson and Anne Reid and more recently, he wrote the acclaimed 5-part series _It’s a Sin_ for Channel 4/HBO MAX which depicts the lives of a group of gay men and their friends who lived during the HIV/AIDS crisis in the UK, which has received numerous awards. He has recently taken over as showrunner on _Doctor Who_.

**Mark Gatiss** has had a long and varied career as a writer, director and producer behind the camera, as well as being a critically-acclaimed actor and published author. His early success on television was as part of the comedy troupe _The League of Gentlemen_, for which he both wrote and appeared onscreen as various characters. He had a childhood passion for _Doctor Who_ and both wrote for and starred in the modern revival. He was also the writer and executive producer of _An Adventure in Space and Time_, a drama of the genesis of the series as part of the show’s 50th Anniversary celebrations  in 2013.

In 2017, he curated and directed _Queers_ – a series of eight monologues for BBC Four to mark the 50th Anniversary of the 1967 Sexual Offences Act which saw the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality.

Recent screen acting roles include The Duke of Marlborough in the BAFTA-winning and Oscar-nominated _The Favourite_ (2018), Disney’s _Christopher Robin_ (2018), BBC One’s _Gunpowder_ (2017_)_, _Wolf Hall_ (2015_)_ and _Game of Thrones_ (2014-2017).
