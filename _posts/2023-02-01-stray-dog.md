**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

In _Stray Dog_ a young police detective, Murakami (Toshiro Mifune), has his gun stolen by a pickpocket. Humiliated by the loss and taking it as a personal slight, he sets out to hunt down the thief – a quest that gains in urgency when the stolen gun becomes a murder weapon. Tipped off by a prostitute that the gun may be sold on the black market, Murakami takes on the guise of an unemployed drifter and, in a virtuoso eight-minute dialogue-free montage sequence, roams through the sleazy underbelly of Tokyo, his casually slouching posture at odds with the fierce watchfulness of his eyes.

Though _Stray Dog_ was one of Kurosawa’s biggest successes prior to _Rashomon_ (1950), he always spoke of it disparagingly – ‘It’s just too technical. All that technique and not one real thought in it’ – and this montage sequence may suggest why. Powerful and visually inventive though it is, with a sense of documentary authenticity and backed by Fumio Hayasaka’s atmospheric score with its snatches of nightclub jazz, it looks a little like bravura technique for its own sake. Half as long would have been just as effective.

_Stray Dog_, like so many of Kurosawa’s early films, teams his two favourite actors, Mifune and Takashi Shimura, pivoting the action around their contrasting and complementary screen personas. Shimura plays Murakami’s section chief Sato, calmer and more settled in his personal life and a steadying influence on his younger colleague. This seems a touch schematic, and we might also expect him to be the more tolerant of the two, with greater sympathy for human weakness. But Kurosawa shows us the downside of the older man’s apparent good nature: to him, all the criminals he pursues are simply evil, to be eliminated. Murakami, for all his anger and personal resentment against his quarry, can’t see it so simplistically. ‘I can’t think that way yet,’ he says. ‘In the war I saw men turn bad very easily.’ (The war, still recent, casts a long shadow over the film. ‘He changed completely after the war,’ says the killer’s mother, smiling helplessly.) Murakami’s ‘yet’ is pointed. Give him time, and he may well become like his boss – outwardly more amiable, but with the crucial sensitive edge of his human sympathy eroded.

For the moment, though, as Sato notes, his young colleague has a lot in common with the man he’s hunting. ‘You understand him too well,’ he warns, quoting a saying that ‘Mad dogs only see what they’re after.’ Murakami, with his obsessive pursuit, is turning into a mad dog himself, slavering and panting in the heat. Eventually even Sato starts to share in the single-minded obsession; heat is a great leveller. But the pursuit gets nowhere until the weather breaks, the skies opening in one of those torrential Kurosawan drenchings. Yet though the case is solved, there’s no easy closure to grant us release. When Murakami finally confronts and disarms him, the killer – who’s no more than a youth – doesn’t snarl defiance but howls abjectly like a punished child. We’re left with a desolate sense of lives distorted and wasted. 
**Philip Kemp, _Sight and Sound_, February 2002**  

While Kurosawa’s depiction of life in the poverty, crime and disease-ridden slums in _Drunken Angel_ creates a vivid portrait of the underbelly of occupied Japan, the political issues of the Occupation era are more precisely – albeit metaphorically – analysed in _Stray Dog_. Detectives Murakami and Sato explicitly identify the criminal Shinjiro Yusa, who has stolen the former’s gun, as a representative of the _après-guerre_ generation, so that the film associates crime with the post-war period and the cultural milieu of the Occupation.

But _Stray Dog_’s perspective is more complex than that; Murakami, the flawed hero, can also be interpreted as a critical personification of traditional Japanese values. The critic Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto interprets Murakami’s desperate desire to recover his gun from a Freudian perspective: the gun is the phallus. While this interpretation is tenable, it’s more rewarding to read Murakami’s response in a political light. The policeman’s particular devotion to his own weapon may be related to the values of _bushido_, the samurai code, according to which, in the words of the Japanese author Inazo Nitobe, the sword is ‘the soul of the samurai’. Thus Murakami’s despair at the loss of his gun and dedication to its recovery suggest a connection with _bushido_ values: in this case, the gun is the ‘soul of the policeman’.

These warrior values were, of course, the values promoted by Japan’s military government of the pre-war and wartime era. In the context of the film’s production during the Occupation, when that militarist ethos was explicitly repudiated, it’s no surprise to find such values subjected to sharp critique, as when Murakami’s superior questions his obsession with recovering his own weapon, neglecting the wider problem of illegal weapons traded on the black market: ‘You should have tried to get all the guns, not just your own.’ The suggestion is that Murakami’s _bushido_-influenced attitudes are hampering his effectiveness as a detective. The militarist past, meanwhile, is explicitly evoked in a number of scenes: when Sato interrogates a fearful bellboy at a hotel, he reassures him with the words: ‘The army officers may have beaten you, but we won’t.’

But violence in _Stray Dog_ isn’t only associated with Japan’s past. The criminal Shinjiro Yusa’s associations with the new Japan are underlined by the nature and context of his crimes. Whereas the gangster boss in _Drunken Angel_ inhabits a traditional Japanese house, in _Stray Dog_ a similar old-fashioned wooden dwelling is where Yusa murders a woman; here, tradition is associated with innocence, and the post-war with crime.

This interpretation is strengthened by the presentation of Yusa’s girlfriend, the showgirl Harumi, to whom he has given an extravagant Western-style dress, paid for out of the proceeds of his criminal activities. In a visually dramatic scene, she affirms her commitment to him by putting on the dress in place of her traditional Japanese yukata, and dancing frantically until her mother tears the garment from her body. In response, Harumi breaks down and embraces her mother, implicitly rejecting both the dress and the man who gave it to her. This rejection of a Western-style garment is soon followed by her rejection of her lover, whom she betrays to Murakami.

_Stray Dog_ thus seems to embody a distinctly ambivalent attitude to both Japanese tradition and the modern values of the West. Its conclusion, however, seems to point to a way forward, reconciling Murakami’s _bushido_-inspired commitment to his weapon with his successful performance of his professional duties in the post-war police force. In the film’s final scene, he apologises for having been too obsessed with the recovery of his own gun; Sato reassures him with the knowledge that his pursuit of his own weapon has led to the police’s capture of a whole stash of illegal weapons.

In the context of the post-war constitution, which pledged Japan to pacifism, it’s surely no coincidence that the focus of _Stray Dog_ is on the question of disarmament. Despite the many ambiguities of these two late-1940s masterpieces, Kurosawa, it seems, did ultimately endorse the project of the Occupation.
