An idealistic young doctor is unwittingly infected with a patient’s syphilitic blood. Although determined to continue his vocation, his medical condition has a profound effect on his relationship with the woman he loves, while the man who infected him comes to play a significant role in his life. Kurosawa and Mifune create the first of their noble heroes in Kyoji Fujisaki, a man committed to service and whose values lay in the betterment of society over the individual.

Kurosawa’s fraught, dark melodrama ventures into territory that no Hollywood film of the era would have gone near. It opens in ominous fashion, with an immense rainstorm. The plotline is grim in the extreme: Toshiro Mifune plays an overworked surgeon who contracts syphilis from a patient – a disease that in 1940s Japan was well-nigh incurable. He keeps his condition secret, injects himself with drugs, but calls off his marriage. It takes a certain boldness to make a love story in which venereal disease comes between the devoted couple; Mifune brings a febrile intensity to his role as the hero tormented by a desire he can’t risk fulfilling.
