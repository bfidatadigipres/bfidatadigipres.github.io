In this lavishly illustrated talk with clips and slides Adrian Wootton (CEO of Film London and film curator) will explore Kurosawa’s remarkable trilogy of films, _Throne of Blood_, _The Bad Sleep Well_ and _Ran_, adapting Shakespeare plays into resonant cinema that also drew deeply on Japanese history and artistic traditions of painting and theatre.
