_+ intro with director Pierre Földes_

Based on a collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami, this animated feature film follows the lives of multiple characters as they navigate post-tsunami existence and the existential repercussions of urban life, including an unambitious bank employee, his frustrated wife, a delusional accountant, a lost cat and a giant talkative frog. It’s an ambitious treat that flirts with the surreal and delivers on all fronts.

Tokyo, a few days after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Kyoko suddenly leaves her husband after spending five days in a row glued to unfolding earthquake footage on TV. Her helpless husband Komura takes a week’s leave from work and heads north to deliver a box and its unknown content to two young women. His colleague Katagiri, a simple debt collector by profession and an awkward loner in life, returns home one evening to find a two-meter-tall frog asking for his help to save Tokyo from an imminent earthquake. Through memories, dreams and fantasies, Kyoko, Komura and Katagiri, influenced by their visions of earthquakes – which are manifested as evil willow trees, giant earthworms, secret vows, mysterious boxes and a dark, endless corridor – attempt to rediscover their true selves.  
**Production notes**  

The work of novelist Haruki Murakami seems to be finding new life on screen with increasing frequency. Lee Changdong’s _Burning_ (2018) revelled in the ambiguity of its source text through the alluring but intentionally opaque performances of its actors, while Ryūsuke Hamaguchi expanded one Murakami short story (and drew from several others) for his three-hour film _Drive My Car_ (2021). Despite operating in a different medium with different narrative priorities, director Pierre Földes takes a not dissimilar approach to Hamaguchi, interlinking separate short stories from Murakami’s collection _Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman_ and folding them into loosely connected vignettes.

Set in Tokyo in 2011, in the wake of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami but before the aftershocks, the film follows its group of characters as a ‘very big earthquake, even worse than the one that struck last week’ threatens the city – at least, according to a giant anthropomorphic frog. The stories begin together before diverging into separate chapters, their characters connected by nightmare. Two businessmen are haunted by disturbing dreams – of being trapped in stark, collapsing corridors, of being eaten whole by giant worms disguising themselves as commuter trains. These sequences immediately present an interesting visual tension which runs throughout the film, as Földes contrasts the surrealism of these nightmares with the naturalism of its quasi-rotoscoped acting. The existential crisis of each character leads to conversations with others that bring up long anecdotes, references to films, books and more, each tale containing stories within stories. The Russian doll approach to narrative suits _Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman_: it visually leans into the surreality often found in Murakami’s stories, visualising his idiosyncrasies by exploring different variations on its art style.

Földes flirts with psychological horror as he conjures different textures, flashbacks bringing with them changes in the style of lines and colouring. The film feels malleable and unbound from reality – we see one man drawn through swirling scribbles, the lines then detaching themselves from him and turning into the crest of a wave. But the distinctive animation lends realism to the volume and movement of the characters’ bodies.

Though some of the animation can seem a little rough, for the most part it’s gorgeous, the beautiful layouts and compositions filled with fascinating detail. Translucent lines and rough crosshatched textures throughout the background art give the film both tactility and a touch of ephemerality. It’s a perfect embodiment of its combination of realist elements and strange visions, historical concerns and waking dreams. The film’s directness and its dry sense of humour – brought out most of all through the editing and tongue-in-cheek superimpositions – make _Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman_ an invigorating translation of writing to the animated form.
