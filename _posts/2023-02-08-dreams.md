A portmanteau work comprising eight tales inspired by recurring dreams the director had, Kurosawa’s penultimate film – the first solely written by him since 1945’s _The Men Who Tread on the Tiger’s Tail_ – is one of his most personal and playful. His on-screen alter ego, identifiable by the trademark hat he wore in public, journeys through a variety of scenarios, focussing primarily on humanity’s relationship with nature. It features Ozu favourite Chishu Ryu as a wise old man and Martin Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh.

**A contemporary review**  
Apparently Kurosawa has signed on to make another film and we must wish him luck with this venture, yet in the nature of things-the director is over 80-it is possible that _Dreams_ will be his swansong. The film does seem to be a summation of sorts, not least because of its simplicity of theme and its personal directness – attributes of the work of aged artists from Titian and Rembrandt to Renoir and Matisse. Is it as great as the late work of these artists? Is it a great work at all? Criticism, so far, has been divided.

The press handout was unusually austere, a sequence of stills and the cast-list. Yet even without reading a production blurb, I would imagine that the title is to be taken literally: these are dreams (and nightmares) which Kurosawa has actually experienced and which stayed in the memory in the way that certain iconic dreams do, to haunt or console. One deduces this from the oddly private and even arbitrary quality of several episodes. They have been tidied up, of course, to be changed into cinematic spectacle; yet the details and transitions of emotion remain unpredictable and quirky: you feel that such touches could not or would not be invented.

The film opens with a summer downpour. ‘Rain in bright sunshine: it’s when foxes go courting in the forest,’ mother says to little Akira, aged five or so, who promptly goes off to explore. In the forest, beautifully shot (no one shoots rain like Kurosawa), the foxes, actually human dancers, are in stealthy procession. Passing a tree, they spy the child, who hurries back home in fright. But his dream-mother is severe and presents the little boy with a dagger in a sheath. ‘They have seen you, haven’t they? You must commit suicide!’

The second and third episodes have a strange dark melancholy. In the former, a party of climbers is struggling in a blizzard; the leader encourages his men, urging them above all not to fall asleep. An angel appears and, pressing a magic blanket over the leader’s shoulders, lulls him to the verge of unconsciousness. He shakes her off (obviously she is a demon, not an angel), but finds that his followers are dead.

Immediate transition to episode three. Now we are in the war, or near the end of it. Twilight: a fierce dog, wearing a body vest that seems to contain bombs, barks at a lonely officer. From the end of a tunnel a ghost platoon in full marching gear emerges and halts. The officer addresses the soldiers, urging them in hectoring tones to turn back, which they eventually do. Fiercer than ever, the dog continues to bark at the officer... (The underlying emotion of this fantasy is cowardice, sadness, fear.)

The next episode is altogether brighter, though it too has sinister elements, notably in its crow-haunted ending. This is the celebrated Van Gogh sequence-celebrated because the painter is impersonated by none other than Martin Scorsese. Some critics, alas, have found this risible, perhaps because Scorsese does so little to play down the accents of Little Italy. Yet after all, there are not many lines of dialogue at issue: the sequence is predominantly visual, consisting mainly of Akira as a young man wandering in splendid Van Gogh landscapes, photographed now naturalistically (with ‘real’ fields, bridges, buildings), now by reference to the paintings themselves which, thanks to the skill of matte processes, have been ‘three-dimensionalised’, allowing the actor to enter the compositions in most literal detail.

Two further episodes introduce violent, apocalyptic anxieties. In the first, there is general panic as Mount Fuji sheds its skin in multiple explosions caused, we hear, not by natural eruption but by the meltdown of six nearby nuclear reactors. (Why six? A typical and, one hopes, dream-invented detail.) Japan, anyhow, is an island, and there is not enough room for Akira and his companions, who include a mother and her two children, to escape from the different radioactive gases-gases which have been thoughtfully individualised: you can tell what is killing you by its distinctive colouring. Where to go? Where to fly to? At the edge of a cliff, the only option seems suicide.

Yet in the second apocalyptic episode our hero, now alone, has survived into a post-nuclear landscape of dark volcanic ash. He meets a groaning demon with horns and sees dandelions that have mutated into giant sunflowers. In the valley beneath them he spies other horned humans beside a lake, engaged in what looks like a hopeless lament, a choral ballet of despair.

Switch, with relief, to the final episode, a complete contrast in tone and sensibility. Instead of anguish, peace and serenity; instead of consuming fire, solacing winter. A village on a river, served by stately waterwheels: flowers and children wherever you look. An old man (played by Ozu’s favourite alter ego, Chishu Ryu, now aged 86) gives our hero cogent reasons for death to be ‘happy’. And indeed that procession coming towards us with its merry sound of drums and cymbals, could it be?-yes, it is-a funeral. Evidently, joy is the right note to go out on.

In the reviews of the film from Cannes, there was a repeated disappointed reference to the director’s rhetorical preachiness, with an implication of humanist coat-trailing. Yet I think this is to misunderstand how individual and unanswerable dreams really are. Kurosawa was himself present at the great earthquake of Tokyo in 1923 (there is a powerful description of the event in his autobiography) and one feels that, whatever has happened subsequently, the anticipation of disaster was from that time etched into his deepest character. Hiroshima and Nagasaki confirmed the phobia, as how should they not? I do not agree that the film is too literal, or even that it ‘preaches’ a humanist message. It seems to me to arise not ‘out of rational discourse but from the subconscious, where art originates. For all its expensive production values, simplicity of emotion seems to be the keynote-as it was in Shakespeare’s last plays.
