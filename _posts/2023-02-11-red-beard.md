_+ intro by Ian Haydn Smith, season co-curator (Saturday 11 February only)_

Kurosawa’s last black and white film was his final collaboration with Mifune. It might not be one of their best-known works, but it is one of their richest. Adapted from the short stories of Shogoro Yamamoto and drawing from Dostoevsky’s _Humiliated and Insulted_, it tells the story of the combative relationship between a doctor and his trainee at a rural clinic. The film features only one swordfight – albeit one of the most thrilling he directed – but in exploring themes of humanism and existentialism _Red Beard_ evinces the depth and detail of the 19th-century Russian novels that Kurosawa adored.  
**bfi.org.uk**  

The popular image of Kurosawa is of a director of samurai movies. People who know his work well tend to protest at this, pointing out that he made many other films, several with modem-day settings. Yet in a sense, the popular judgement isn’t wrong. The figure of the samurai – or, rather, that of the _ronin_, the masterless samurai who has to carve out his own path, frequently in the teeth of convention – stands at the heart of almost all his movies. Often literally so – the swordsmen who come to the aid of the peasants in _Seven Samurai_ are _ronin_, as of course is the scruffy sword-for-hire hero of _Yojimbo_. And contemporary figures like the obsessive young cop in _Stray Dog_ or the company executive seeking revenge for his father’s death in _The Bad Sleep Well_ (Kurosawa’s updating of _Hamlet_) also fit the template.

Kurosawa’s perennial concern is with Japanese society and its fatal urge towards social conformity – authority obeyed without question. Hence his predilection for the _ronin_ figure – the maverick who values practical results over etiquette and follows his own judgement with no concern for outward show. The gruff, inspirational Dr Niide at the centre of _Red Beard_ is a _ronin_ within his own profession, a man who marches to the beat of a different drum. As played by Mifune (in his last film for Kurosawa), he’s a figure of overwhelming authority, brushing aside the accepted pieties of medical orthodoxy. (For old times’ sake Kurosawa even tosses in a brief action sequence where Niide demolishes a gang of heavies, with excruciatingly bone-crunching sound effects.) Though a non-Japanese outsider might not guess it, _Red Beard_ and _Sanjuro_ are set around the same period: the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in the mid-19th century, when Japan was being forcibly opened to the west and the rigidly stratified society that had prevailed for three centuries was beginning to crumble. Meticulous and perfectionist as ever, Kurosawa had an entire small town constructed for the film, which took two years to shoot.  
**Philip Kemp, _Sight and Sound_, November 2003**  

Kurosawa’s monumental film, two years in the making, has inevitably invited comparisons with American hospital soap opera: Red Beard the respected master of his clinic, with a simple but essentially sound philosophy and little time for the new-fangled ideas of tiro medical graduates. In fact, Red Beard and Dr Gillespie are as alike as Raymond Massey and Toshiro Mifune. Kurosawa’s canvas is Dickensian, and his characters are sketched with no more profundity than those of Oliver Twist. But psychological subtlety is not his purpose. He is not, like Ray or Olmi or Forman, a chronicler of human minutiae; his strokes, like those of the samurai’s sword, are broad and sweeping, as precisely and simply effective as the wipe he uses as an editing device.

On a superficial level Kurosawa deals, like the Westerns he admires, in blacks and whites. And there are moments in this film, as there were in _High and Low_, which come near to being trite, even sentimental: when, for instance, the girl rescued from the brothel wipes the young doctor’s fevered brow with snow she has scraped from the window; or when, having listened to the story of the wheelwright who has worked himself to death in the clinic because he thought that his wife’s death had ended his share of happiness, the doctor decides at last to put on his hospital uniform and devote himself to good works. Here, as elsewhere, the soundtrack swells with a parody of Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’.

One’s immediate reaction is cynicism; and this is precisely why Kurosawa made the film, as Donald Richie has pointed out. The proposition that good begets good openly invites ridicule in a cynical world; but that Kurosawa is saying, is the cynical world’s loss. As in _The Lower Depths_ and _High and Low_, we are introduced to a hell on earth out of which there gradually emerges a hope for the inmates.

The clinic is under-budgeted, the patients are underfed; they are slum people, the new doctor is told, ‘full of fleas’ and the sense of smell is almost tangible in the crowded images of the patients huddled together against the cold. The good is there, but buried; it needs the infinite patience of a Red Beard to bring it out. ‘Any doctor can help them,’ Yasumoto says of the clinic’s patients after his interest has been aroused by the hysterical woman kept apart from the rest because she is a special case. But he learns his first lesson when the woman nearly kills him, just as later he watches fascinated as Red Beard persists in his efforts to get the brothel girl to take medicine and simply by his persistence breaks through her bitterness and persuades her to take it. Yasumoto at first sees only the horror of the dying man’s spasms. But like Red Beard, he gradually learns to look beyond it, to come to terms with the difficult truth that pity is not enough; that like the seven samurai and like Red Beard, he must also go out and do battle against evil.

Kurosawa’s theme is thus the reverse of sentimentality because he directly challenges us to be cynical and then shows us that our cynicism is as hollow as sending a cheque to a charity before settling down to a good dinner: the doctors in the clinic don’t have coal for their fires because it is more important for the patients’ fires to be kept going. This is not the easiest of propositions to put across, but Kurosawa manages it magnificently.

The film is a fresco of details, and here one can only mention a few of them (a whole essay could be devoted, for instance, to the use Kurosawa makes of natural sound or the part that the music plays in the film). The style is deceptively simple, and the film is studded with examples of Kurosawa’s genius for composition within a frame, like the scene in which Yasumoto and the mad woman are seen at opposite ends of the frame with just the flicker of a candle lighting the central area of blackness. Here the camera is fixed; elsewhere it describes sweeping arcs of movement (the scene in which Red Beard suddenly erupts into violence, breaking the bones of a dozen opponents before mumbling to himself ‘I’m afraid I went a bit too far’). Again, single images of stunning beauty (the extraordinary depth of focus in some of the flashback sequences (the haunting weirdness of the hundreds of little bells set ringing by a gust of wind in the market-place) are counterpointed by long scenes in which the camera lingers long enough over suffering for us to feel it (the old man dying, his body twitching at the bottom of the frame; the operation on an injured girl, with the camera fixed on the girl’s legs tethered to a wall). Like Yasumoto, we are forced to watch; and like him we learn a little more about ourselves.
