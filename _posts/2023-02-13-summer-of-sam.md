_+ intro by Spike Lee_  

**A contemporary review**  
_Summer of Sam_, set in New York during the heatwave of 1977 when serial killer David Berkowitz was terrorising the city, has been largely misrepresented by the press. A _New York Times_ article in June quoted relatives of Berkowitz’s victims railing against its director Spike Lee. ‘He feels that murder is entertainment,’ said one. Berkowitz himself, now serving six consecutive life sentences, expressed his disappointment that the film was raking up ‘what is best forgotten.’

Berkowitz, however, is only a minor player in the movie he helped inspire: _Summer of Sam_ could just as well have been called _Summer of Reggie_ (while Berkowitz was on his killing spree, baseball player Reggie Jackson helped the Yankees win the World Series) or _Scenes from an Italian-American Marriage_. Lee’s real interest is in the relationships between members of a close-knit neighbourhood in the Bronx. With tensions aggravated by the sweaty weather and the fear of a serial killer in their midst, it’s a community which is close to boiling point – similar to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood in _Do the Right Thing_. Lee captures brilliantly the creeping sense of paranoia that affected the city and the strange, macabre thrill of having its own serial killer. (To avoid Sam, who reportedly favours brunettes, women begin dying their hair blond or wearing wigs.) With such craziness in the air, it doesn’t even seem incongruous when the killer begins to think a black Labrador is talking to him, enjoining him to ‘kill, kill, kill.’

The film begins and ends with veteran journalist Jimmy Breslin speaking directly to camera about ‘the summer of Sam’. His presence at once evokes the metropolis we know from Weegee photographs and gritty cop dramas, and creates a strange kind of nostalgia. In _Summer of Sam_, as in Martin Scorsese’s _Bringing Out the Dead_ (set in the early 90s), we’re seeing a New York which no longer exists. Mayor Giuliani may have cleaned up crime (homicides are now at their lowest since 1961, Breslin tells us) but he has also taken the heart out of the city. But _Summer of Sam_ also fit loosely into the serial-killer genre, a line which stretches from _M_ (1931) to _Se7en_. Several plot points even rekindle memories of Hitchcock’s _The Lodger_ (1926): as the lynch-mob mentality gets out of control, an innocent man is targeted simply because he doesn’t fit in.

Lee, who adapted an original screenplay by Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, isn’t above playing up the Italian-American stereotypes. Family loyalty and religious guilt figure as prominently here as they do in Scorsese’s movies. Well over two hours long, _Summer of Sam_ isn’t taut, either. It is an ensemble piece full of flamboyant minor characters (Tony Olives, Joey T), all of them played beautifully. Ben Gazzara’s patriarchal mobster has one big scene in a restaurant, but is barely glimpsed after that; Bebe Neuwirth (Vinny’s boss) and Patti Lupone (Ritchie’s mother) seem similarly underused.

Lee’s focus is more on Vinny’s crumbling marriage to Dionna and his friendship with Ritchie. Mumbling, cursing, intensely physical, John Leguizamo’s Vinny comes across like a diminutive version of Brando’s Stanley Kowalski. Adrien Brody is equally striking as the punk who wanders round New York ‘sounding like a British fag,’ and looking as if he has just escaped from Carnaby Street. Berkowitz then is only there to provide the historical context for what turns out to be one of Lee’s very best films – a sprawling, brilliantly acted character study which touches on love, friendship and betrayal, while also managing to recreate the last days of disco without a note of self-parody.
