_+ Q&A with Blaise Kirschner_

_UNICA_ is the new, eagerly anticipated film by Blaise Kirschner, a personally absorbing exploration of post-apocalyptic game worlds that merges current forms of digital production such as motion capture with drawing and quasi-archaeological procedures, calling attention to the artificial naturalisation of historical and ongoing violence, and the conditions of possibility for its decoding and disruption. Shot in Berlin, as an eerie fiction, _UNICA_ follows a motion-capture performer and an artist, her mother, as their interstitial machine world is built and born from a landscapes on the city’s edge that has grown over war ruins. The programme includes other examples of artist films that draw on computer generated worlds and we look forward to welcoming Jarman Award winner Kirschner for a conversation about their new film and research.

**UNICA**  
UNICA is named after the writer and artist Unica Zürn (1916 – 1970), whose illustrated text _The House of Illnesses_ (1958) figures her body and her institutionalisation as one formation. Rethinking contemporary forms of immersion in simulated worlds through Zürn’s body-building, _UNICA_ attends to the syncretic lifeforms that emerge from the intra-actions between the organismic, technological and phantasmal today. The latent presence of an unnamed catastrophe is repeatedly evoked by the protagonists, an artist and a motion-capture performer, via overlapping references to post-apocalyptic computer games, drawings, and dreams. This deliberate indeterminacy is extended to Teufelsberg, a forested hill on the outskirts of Berlin made from the debris of Second World War ruins, where parts of the work were filmed. By merging motion capture with quasi-archaeological procedures, _UNICA_ calls attention to the artificial naturalisation of historical and ongoing violence, and the conditions of possibility for its decoding and disruption.

**Hudson Valley Ruins**  
Depicting various domestic spheres of a suburban north American context, _Hudson Valley Ruins_ is a machinima video that relies on _The Sims 3_ computer graphics engine to depict the absurd, alienated, and often uncanny lives of several characters, focusing on two young girls and their visions, experiences, and fantasies.
