**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

US cinema had quite a run of prestigious, serious-minded relationship crisis movies in the 1970s and 80s (_Kramer vs. Kramer_, _Shoot the Moon_, much Woody Allen), but none delivered a jolt of pure malice like Danny DeVito’s savage black comedy. The shock was augmented by having Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, hitherto known for their romping _Romancing the Stone_ adventures, now stomping each other into the ground as wealthy yuppies Barbara and Oliver Rose, whose divorce turns into a full-blown war zone.

It’s framed as a cautionary tale by DeVito’s lawyer, and we’re spared nothing as their sunny (empty?) soufflé of a marriage curdles: vicious verbal jousts, booby traps and physical abuse using their possessions, symbols of pampered, unexamined lives… it’s all unfair game. The sole compromise is Turner not turning their dog into paté, but otherwise, to its final hand-off rejection, this is bare-knuckle Hollywood brawling, dealing low blows with glee.

**A contemporary review**  
Whereas Danny DeVito’s directorial debut, _Throw Momma from the Train_, was marred by a typically Hollywood streak of sogginess (happy endings all round, and Momma dying from natural causes), one can have no such complaint about his follow-up, _The War of the Roses_. The presence of the director and his two co-stars suggests a spin-off of _Romancing the Stone_, but instead results in what is probably the bleakest portrait of a marriage since the heyday of Ingmar Bergman. Some of the exchanges, especially in the earlier part of the film, ring particularly true to life: Oliver impatiently interrupting his wife’s anecdote at a dinner party, for example, or her flinching at his affected laughter.

Flying in the face of the current trend for ‘feelgood’ endings, the film sticks to its guns to the last, when the mortally wounded Oliver attempts to hold hands with his similarly injured wife – and she brushes him away; which is enough to make the ending of _Duel in the Sun_ seem positively upbeat. The presentation is stylised; DeVito delights in setting his leading players off against each other by visual means as well as verbal – camera angles and tricks of proportion which make one loom larger than the other, for instance. The violence is largely of the Tom and Jerry bounce-back variety (the couple look in remarkably good shape for people who have been hurled on to a hard floor from a great height), but otherwise only two concessions appear to have been made to popular sentiment.

One is the framing device by which D’Amato is seen to be telling the story; at the end he sends his prospective client packing with the un-lawyerly advice that married couples should stick together through thick and thin – which gives the audience a chance to decide whether to view the entire saga as a tale which has either been inflated in the telling or made up from scratch. The other concession is a brief insert of Oliver’s dog to indicate that it hasn’t been made into pâté after all (even though Oliver thinks it has): a regrettable failure of nerve, and rather unfair to the cat which has already been sacrificed to the wheels of Oliver’s Morgan. On the minus side as well is Marianne Sägebrecht’s housekeeper, a character so redundant that one can only assume that DeVito took advantage of the actress’ presence in the vicinity when filming began.

The film fairly summarises one of the shortcomings of modern marriage: all consuming aspiration towards a dream of achievement (nice income, nice house, nice children) coupled with flagrant neglect of the spiritual side of things and an obsession with petty point-scoring. Though it’s being presented as a black comedy, it isn’t particularly funny, and one might also carp that Oliver and Barbara are such unlikeable characters that one cares little about their descent, locked in mutual antagonism, into self-destruction, though it might well be the aforementioned spiritual lack which makes them seem so brittle and unpleasant in the first place. Whatever, it confirms DeVito as one of the few mainstream filmmakers who are willing (and powerful enough) to take risks.
