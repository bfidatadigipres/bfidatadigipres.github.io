‘Anyone can be seen to be eccentric if you take him out of his milieu and put him into someone else’s.’ – Ivor Cutler, 1974

Ivor Cutler, the poet, singer, musician, teacher, painter, illustrator, sculptor, playwright and all-round creative, was born in Govan in January 1923. Across a wide-ranging career which lasted more than half a century, he produced over 1,500 written works and made some 400 radio and television appearances.  He published 29 books, many self-illustrated and several of them intended for children, as well as 11 albums of songs, poems, stories, dialogues and plays.

Cutler’s radio career was substantial and sustained, yet to television audiences he was something of an occasional curiosity. Never given his own show barring some untransmitted pilots, he was instead boxed up as an amusing turn in light entertainment shows such as _The Acker Bilk Band Show_ (BBC TV, 1962) or as a frequent, freakish contributor to _Late Night Line-Up_ (BBC Two,  1964-71).

This session sets out to offer up examples of where his style, and perceived eccentricity, was best used. Perhaps the ultimate example, and his most widely remembered screen appearance, was in The Beatles’ Boxing Day spectacular _The Magical Mystery Tour_ (BBC One, 1967). His character, the lugubrious Buster Bloodvessel, declared he was ‘concerned for you to enjoy yourselves... within the limits of British decency.’ We ask the same of you all this afternoon.

**Alive and Kicking – British Poets**  
Ivor Cutler trained as a teacher in the late 1940s and continued in the profession for over 30 years. History records that his teaching methods were unusual; taking a position at the notoriously progressive Summerhill in the early 1950s left a lasting impression. The bulk of his career, however, was spent at two London schools – Paddington Green and Fox Primary – and he would divide his working week between them. His lessons focused on drama and movement, encouraging creativity and improvisation from his pupils.

Cutler was proud of this work and explored ways of bringing it to television on a number of occasions. He wrote to Huw Wheldon in May 1964 proposing a BBC documentary about his teaching at Paddington, where, in his words, the aim is ‘to free the children so that they can grow.’ _Late Night Line-Up_ paid a visit to his Fox class on 12 July 1965, for transmission four days later. Ian Keill’s quarter-hour film ‘Children Dancing’ was shown on two occasions. Cutler tried to interest the channel controllers in further screenings but it was not to be, and the film was not kept.

Later, ABC Television filmed a pilot in spring 1966 initially called _Cock-a-Doodle-Don’t_ but referred to in some documents as _Jinx_. This was made with Fox pupils and appears not to have been transmitted or archived.

All of which means that the sole surviving footage of Ivor Cutler’s teaching practice is a half-hour programme for the London Weekend Television series _Alive and Kicking – British Poets_, initially broadcast in the capital at lunchtime on 18 July 1971. Late night-screenings followed on HTV and weeks later on ATV, meaning it was little seen with just 50,000 viewers catching its first broadcast.

_Alive and Kicking_ transfers the classroom to the television studio. Publicity for this final programme in the series noted that Cutler ‘works a great deal with children, getting them interested in poetry, encouraging them to respond to imaginary situations, words and sounds, to improvise acting and poetry.’ Unlike the preceding editions, this finale chooses to break away from the usual format in which presenter Adrian Mitchell introduced a poet who read their work and then took part in an interview. Ivor _does_ perform his own work by way of interlude, but the strong emphasis on his pupils demonstrates that his teaching was viewed as a key component of his creative life.

**South of Watford**  
Arguably the most rewarding representation of Ivor Cutler’s worldview on the small screen has been via documentary profile. Sympathetic producers such as Paul Spencer and Alison Pinkney made effective and affecting hour-long programmes in 2005 and 2020, but _South of Watford_ on 9 May 1986  came first.

The series ran from 1983-88 and offered a view of contemporary art and culty fare in the capital and the south east of England. The archive of over 80 programmes is now an invaluable record of cultural life across the decade, with programmes about new fashion, the filofax, and the recently opened Barbican, not to mention the first full profiles of artists such as Leigh Bowery and Derek Jarman. Into this open-minded environment stepped Ivor Cutler.

Nigel Miller’s film places the viewer in the artist’s world, following him around town, to his favourite haunts as well as seeing him in concert. Presenter Hugh Laurie is welcomed into the inner sanctum of the Cutler home at Laurier Road, Parliament Hill. Look out for when the ice finally breaks.
