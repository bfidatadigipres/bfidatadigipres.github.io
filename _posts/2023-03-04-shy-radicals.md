With intro and discussion

A portrait of artist and activist Hamja Ahsan, commander-in-chief of the introvert resistance.

_Shy Radicals_ is a portrait of award-winning artist, activist and author Hamja Ahsan, and the story behind his remarkable book and satirical manifesto _Shy Radicals_, which calls for all shy, quiet, and introverted people to unify and overthrow Extrovert-Supremacy.

In his book, Hamja Ahsan has not simply created an artwork, he has created a world that blurs the boundaries between creator and creation, between real life and the life of the imagination, between reality and an imagined fiction in which he is a leading character. The documentary follows Hamja as he deals with the trauma and despair of his brother’s extradition case, whilst traveling the world inspiring and educating others through creativity and activism.  

Hamja Ahsan’s book **_Shy Radicals: Antisystemic Politics of the Militant Introvert_** is published and distributed by Book Works.  

**Hamja Ahsan** is an artist, writer, activist and curator based in London and Maastricht. He was awarded the Grand Prize at Ljubljana Biennial 2019 for the art work Aspergistan Referendum based on the Shy Radicals project. He is founder and co-curator of the DIY Cultures festival of creative activism, zines and independent publishing since 2013. He was shortlisted for the Liberty human rights award for Free Talha Ahsan campaign on extradition and detention without trial under the War on Terror. His recent writing was anthologised in _No Colour Bar: Black Art in Action 1960-1990_. He has presented art projects at PS1 MOMA New York Art book week, Tate Modern, Gwangju Biennale, Shaanakht festival Pakistan and and CCA Warsaw Poland. His practice encompasses all media: conceptual writing, building archives, performance, video, sound and making zines. He is on the editorial board of the Radical Mental Health magazine Asylum.

Hamja will be in conversation with **Daniel Oliver**, a dyspraxic performance artist and academic. He has been making up calamitous participatory performance art worlds across the UK and overseas since 2003. Performances include _Chiperalataartparty,_ which explores dyspraxic time-travel and a post-apocalyptic neurodivergent (dys)utopia; and _Dadderrs,_ a collaboration with his wife, choreographer Frauke Requardt, that focusses on ADHD, dyspraxia, marriage, and parenting. He has recently edited and published a book on his practice called _Awkwoods: Daniel Oliver’s Dyspraxic Adventures in Contemporary Participatory Performance_, published by the Live Art Development Agency.

His academic research is focussed on contemporary performance and live art, audience participation, neurodiversity, and awkwardness.
