_+ pre-recorded Q&A_

A ground-breaking documentary shot entirely from filmmaker Reid Davenport’s physical perspective, both from his wheelchair and his two feet.

Reid Davenport’s documentary explores the legacy of the Freak Show when a circus comes to town and sets up near his Oakland apartment, while also confronting societal perspectives around Disability in an intimate and thought-provoking way. The screening will be followed by a pre-recorded Q&A with Reid Davenport hosted by BFI Disability Equality Lead, Clare Baines.

**Reid Davenport** makes documentaries about disability from an overtly political perspective. _I Didn’t See You There_ is his first feature film. _Life After_, produced by Multitude Films, will be released in early 2024. In 2020, Davenport was named to DOC NYC’s ‘40 Filmmakers Under 40.’ His short film _A Cerebral Game_ won the Artistic Vision Award at the 2016 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival. It is distributed by New Day Films, along with his short documentaries _Wheelchair Diaries_ and _Ramped Up_. Davenport’s work has been supported by Field of Vision, Catapult Film Fund, Ford Foundation, Sundance Institute, XTR, ITVS, NBCUniversal, CNN, and Points North Institute, among others.

**Clare Baines** is a writer/director

Presented with descriptive subtitles for the D/deaf and people experiencing hearing loss. Audio Description available. The Q&A will have live-captioning and BSL Interpretation.
