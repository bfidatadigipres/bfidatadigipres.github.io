A disabled-led discourse on accessible advancements within the film industry.

‘Nothing About Us Without Us’ will be a celebration of the BFI’s Disability Screen Advisory Group’s first cohort of leaders: Andrew Miller MBE, David Proud and Kim Tserkezie, joining us virtually, who will shortly step down after 5 years in post driving inclusive change in film. Hosted by ITV Creative Diversity Partner Samantha Tatlow MBE.

These disabled screen pioneers will reflect on the highlights of their own careers in film and TV as well as the advisory group’s innovative and influential work at the BFI: from the pandemic Press Reset campaign to the creation of the world’s first Disability and Visible Difference Panel.

**Andrew Miller MBE** is the Chair of the BFI Disability Screen Advisory Group and an influential cultural figure appearing regularly in the Top 10 of the Shaw Trust Disability Power100 list. Andrew began his career as one of the first generation of disabled presenters on British TV and went on to become a producer/director of music and arts documentaries. He is currently the UK Arts Access Champion supporting the creation of a new national arts access scheme; he is also Creative Director of Trinity College Oxford and is a trustee of major cultural organisations such as BAFTA, Arts Council England and the RSC.

**David Proud** is an English actor/writer/director and a a co-opted member of the BAFTA Film Committee. David made history in 2009 becoming the first regular disabled actor to appear in the BBC prime time continuing drama, _EastEnders_. David was listed numerous timein the Shaw Trust Power 100 List as one of the top 100 most influential disabled people. In 2020 David wrote two episodes of the BBC Continuing Drama _Doctors_ before joining ITV _Coronation Street_. In 2020 David began a development deal with the BFI for a new feature film co-written with his long-time collaborator Paul Viragh. David and Paul also continue to co-direct his feature documentary produced by the Emmy Winning Lindsey Dryden.

**Kim Tserkezie** has worked as an Actor, Presenter, Writer and Producer for twenty-five years, with a career spanning comedy, drama and documentary. Kim set up her production company, Scattered Pictures in 2011. The company, based in Kim’s home city of Newcastle, develops productions which focus on underrepresented talent and perspectives. In 2022, she was included in the Top 10 most influential disabled people in the UK and named Number 1 in Digital, Media and Publishing. She is currently commissioned to co-write two feature films including a project for Netflix.

**Sam Tatlow MBE** is Creative Diversity Partner at ITV and is part of the team delivering the Diversity Acceleration Plan. She is involved in delivering ITV’s Disability agenda and also works closely with producers and the commissioning teams to ensure a diverse and inclusive team are involved for ITV commissions working particularly closely with the teams in Factual Entertainment, Sport, Daytime and the soaps.

The Q&A will have live-captioning and BSL interpretation.
