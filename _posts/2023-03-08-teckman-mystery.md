Wendy Toye originally trained as a ballet dancer before turning to acting and then directing, both on the stage and screen. She inspired a generation of female filmmakers to pursue a career in a male-dominated film industry. In celebration, we present two recently restored films. _The Teckman Mystery_, a stylish whodunnit, details a biographer’s investigating into the death of a young airman. It will show alongside the award-winning short _The Stranger Left No Card_.

**Wendy Toye**  
Wendy Toye was born in London on 1 May 1917, and at the age of three and a half appeared on stage at the Albert Hall in London as a member of a juvenile dance troupe. Her solo turn as part of the act brought her considerable publicity, and Toye began to perform in music halls and charity shows with many of the day’s top stage stars. By the age of five she was working as ‘stooge’ for Hayden Coffin, the famous musical comedy star, on a regular basis. At the age of nine, she appeared at the Palladium in a ballet she had choreographed herself, entitled  _The Japanese Legend of the Rainbow_, set to music by Scarlatti.

The presentation was an enormous success, and Toye was soon much in demand, choreographing ballets and dance routines for numerous stage companies. She was invited to perform with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballet Russe, where she met the filmmaker/artist Jean Cocteau. Toye later appeared at the Café de Paris, as a member of the Markova-Dolin Ballet Company, and gradually began doing more commercial work, such as choreographing routines for the Crazy Gang at the London Palladium.

In 1931, she made her first film appearance, in Anthony Asquith’s _Dance Pretty Lady_, and in 1935 she appeared as Signora Picci in Paul Merzbach’s _Invitation to the Waltz_. But she was more interested in absorbing the technical process of filmmaking than in a career as an actress. By 1942 she was arranging the dances for _The Young Mr Pitt_ (where she was befriended by director Carol Reed, editor David Lean, cameraman Ronald Neame and actors Robert Morley and Richard Attenborough) and in 1946, she served as choreographer on Herbert Wilcox and Anna Neagle’s _Piccadilly Incident_.

From the 1930s to the early 1950s, Toye remained a popular and dependable stage choreographer and director, working in both the UK and the US. In 1949, she directed the Broadway production of _Peter Pan_, starring Boris Karloff and  Jean Arthur, which brought her additional acclaim.

Around the same time, she met British producer George K. Arthur, who had purchased the rights to several short stories, and was casting about for the proper director to bring them to the screen. Toye expressed interest in one story,  _The Stranger Left No Card_ (1953), and was allowed to make it as a 23-minute film on a budget of £3,000. Precisely timed to a synchronised musical score, the film was a delightfully sinister parable, deeply influenced by Cocteau and René Clair.  It impressed Alexander Korda sufficiently for him to offer Toye a contract.

She displayed talent and imagination in directing the ‘In the Picture’ episode of _Three Cases of Murder_ (co-d. David Eady, George More O’Ferrall, 1953), though she felt little enthusiasm for the routine crime films he then offered her. Nevertheless, she handled _The Teckman Mystery_ (1954) with professionalism and efficiency. She felt more affinity with her next assignment, the domestic comedy _Raising a Riot_ (1955), which was critically and commercially successful.

In January 1956, Korda died of a heart attack, and Toye’s contract was shifted to Rank, where she made _All for Mary_ (1955) with Kathleen Harrison, Nigel Patrick and David Tomlinson, and _True as a Turtle_ (1957), a nautical comedy starring John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn and Keith Michell.

Both films did well at the box office, but Toye had to wait until 1962 for her next film assignment, _We Joined the Navy_, another seagoing comedy which boasted a cast which included Kenneth More, Lloyd Nolan, Joan O’Brien, Mischa Auer and John Le Mesurier. Toye’s last theatrical film was a short entitled _The King’s Breakfast_ (1963), after which she turned to directing television drama. In 1981 she made a colour, videotape version of the _Stranger Left No Card_ for Anglia Television as part of the _Tales of the Unexpected_ (ITV, 1979-1988) series, with Derek Jacobi in the title role; in 1986 she served as an associate producer on the TV movie _Barnum!_ starring Michael Crawford.

Although Wendy Toye complained that Rank refused to support her desire to direct projects more ambitious than her comedies, she took pride in the fact that she never went over budget, and that her responsible example paved the way for other women to enter the field. She continued directing stage comedies until the mid-1990s, when she retired, with a lifetime of work in the theatre and film to her considerable credit.

**Films as director**

_The Stranger Left No Card_ (1952). Cannes Film Festival Award: Best Short Film, 1953. ‘I did some things in _Stranger_ which I probably, two or three years later, wouldn’t have attempted…’

_Three Cases of Murder_ (1953). Toye directed _In the Picture_. ‘A man called  Georges Périnal lit it, and he was such a magic _name_ to me. When I was little I  saw a film called _Sous les toits de Paris_, which he lit – the _look_ of that film was  so extraordinary!’

_The Teckman Mystery_ (1954). 90 mins, black-and-white thriller scripted by Francis Durbridge and James Matthews, based on a TV play. ‘Audiences’ brains weren’t so quick in those days. They were used to things done slowly. The remarkable cuts we can all do nowadays get rid of such a lot of rubbish.’

_On the Twelfth Day_ (1955). Nominated Best Short Film, Venice, 1955. Toye worked closely with Ronald Searle on the production design.

_Raising a Riot_ (1955). ‘I think this is a good film, I think it whizzes along quite well, even nowadays.’

_All for Mary_ (1955). First film made for Rank. ‘It is a period piece, isn’t it? I think there’s absolute truth in it – for the 50s. I don’t think that sort of woman, the Nanny, could ever dominate that sort of little boy any longer.’

_True as a Turtle_ (1956). 96 mins, colour, nautical romantic comedy starring  John Gregson, June Thorburn, Cecil Parker.

_A Life to Be Lived_ (1961). 11 mins, black-and-white, 16 mm, distributed by the British Polio Fellowship. Jack Hedley plays a polio victim trying to adjust to life  and work.

_We Joined the Navy_ (1962). ‘A way of taking the mickey out of pomposity, in a very gentle way ... Fellas don’t always do everything right, or the best, it’s as simple as that, isn’t it?’

_The King’s Breakfast_ (1963). 28 mins, colour, dramatisation in dance and mime of A. A. Milne’s poem. Designed by Ronald Searle, made for the Butter Board.  ‘When this film was made, it was thought to be before its time. It seems now that audiences have become more sophisticated and able to appreciate this type of treatment’ (James Archibald, the film’s producer, writing on the film’s release  in 1968).
