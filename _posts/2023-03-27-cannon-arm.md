_+ intro and discussion_

The perfect film for the run up to London Games Week, this affectionate documentary offers a sublime portrait of a group of outsiders who support Kim Cannon Arm, a man of very few words, in his attempt to break the world record score of the 1980s arcade game Gyruss. It’s a generous and nuanced insight into the power of true friendship.

The post screening discussion will be hosted by Benjamin Brown.

Screening in partnership with Citizen Autistic  
The London Autism Film Club
