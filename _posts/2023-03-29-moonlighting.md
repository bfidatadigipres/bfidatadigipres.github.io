_The screening on Wednesday 29 March will be introduced by  Jerzy Skolimowski_

The astonishing thing about _Moonlighting_, given the battery-farming methods invoked to ensure topicality, is the intricate subtlety with which its meaning is built up layer after layer, so that even someone who had never heard of Solidarity and was therefore blind to that particular parable, could read the film alternatively as a Bressonian study of personal relationships under pressure from social constrictions, or as a casebook even wittier than Polanski’s  _The Tenant_ in exploring the foreigner’s despairing disarray when faced with alien speech and customs. If there is a certain rough-and-readiness about the film, it derives less from the production circumstances than from the off-the-cuff improvisational quality that has always overlaid the tendency towards surrealistic imagery in Skolimowski’s work.

Take, for instance, the classically simple long shot of Jeremy Irons cycling away down a deserted street as Nowak sets off on one of his crazier missions and rounds the corner just as his voice on the soundtrack, mumbling explanations, recalls that he has forgotten an all-important photograph. Suddenly, as the camera waits patiently for the bicycle to return, a dog and a cat appear from opposite sides of the frame, the cat warily arching its back in Cold War fright as it passes the dog indifferently going about its business. Obviously a happening, one of those accidents that reward a filmmaker when he is doing everything right, the shot nevertheless epitomises the extraordinary sense of formalism with which Skolimowski manages to endow naturalism (or vice versa).

A less fortuitous example comes in the first supermarket sequence, where the four Poles gape open-mouthed at the awesomely tempting variety of goods on display, and their delighted foray with rapidly filling trolleys ends just as a hovering supervisor pounces on a hapless female shoplifter. Formal enough in a conventional sense, but a more genuine formalism is imposed on the scene by two entirely naturalistic details which invest it with the quality of an almost surreal warning: the organ blasts dispensing ‘Heilige Nacht’ over the tannoy system as suitable Christmas fare (intimating the Poles’ misery over their enforced absence from church), and the pair of hip Black shoppers swaying ecstatically to unheard rhythms (from earphones which recall the ubiquitous possibility of bugging and wire-tapping).

Throughout the film, in fact, Skolimowski puts naturalistic detail to formal use. Nowak’s early intimation of why communications have been cut with Poland comes from a row of TV sets glimpsed in a shop window: no sound, just images, but with the sense of desolation evoked by shots of tanks in the streets of Warsaw unbearably intensified by the absolute silence. A sense of desolation later transposed to a scene where Nowak, lying brooding in bed with the useless second-hand TV set beside him, imagines that he sees his girl Anna (in fact the reflection of a snapshot tacked on the wall opposite) appear on the screen, momentarily animated in silent reproach by his own agitation. Similarly with a whole network of casual shots designed to illuminate the relative importance in Nowak’s troubled mind of his feelings about the absent Anna, the job in hand and the fate of Solidarity: one of him stopping to stare in horror at a row of Solidarity posters (he had previously passed the same posters in different circumstances without noticing them), or several of him staring longingly at a girl in the house opposite (but not even noticing when she undresses before his very eyes).

Extremely funny in its account of Nowak’s running battle with English manners and customs (‘I can speak their language,’ he mournfully complains, ‘but I don’t really know what they mean’), where he invariably manages to turn misunderstandings to good account, even funnier in its observation of the deadpan skill with which Nowak pulls the wool over suspicious eyes in becoming a master shoplifter, _Moonlighting_ is exemplary in the way it gradually expands Nowak’s duplicity in everything he does to a more general application. At first, all one has to hang on to is the fact that he is not (by his own admission) a member of Solidarity, and that he is merely a catspaw for a mysterious boss able to finagle foreign currency for imperialist living standards in a manner hardly consonant with party ideology. But once in London – at the same precariously safe distance from HQ as Warsaw from Moscow – he is able to exercise a certain autonomy; and his policy of duplicity, however well-intentioned, is gradually exposed as a declaration of bankruptcy in the successive stages of his ‘regime’. First a rude attempt to assert authority (no smoking, no noise), then a gesture of conciliation (the purchase of the TV set), a reluctant admission of fallibility (‘It’s not true I always fail; I’ll show them!’), a time of desperate measures (advancing the clock to persuade the weary workers that they have slept well), a confession of failure (‘I thought I could control these men, but I’m weaker than they are’), and finally abject collapse in the face of rebellion (‘They don’t want to be told what to do any more. Let them try’).

A remarkable film, _Moonlighting_ is all the more remarkable in that this parable never interferes with its character conflicts or its sly humour, and certainly never becomes anything so overt as a message; while its sharp-tongued satire, taking its cue from Jeremy Irons’ superlative portrayal of well-meaning bafflement, is constructively compassionate not destructively mocking.
