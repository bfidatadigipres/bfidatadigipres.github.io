A labour of love for writer-director Elaine Constantine, _Northern Soul_’s initially modest distribution was expanded significantly following critical acclaim and a passion-driven social media campaign. Voted film of the year by _NME_, it follows two young lads in the 1970s as they chase their dream of travelling to the USA, discovering the best in soul music and establishing themselves as top DJs on the Northern soul circuit.

The characters in photographer Elaine Constantine’s first feature are so narrowly focused on music that, aside from the inevitable link between the Northern Soul scene and specific fashions – high-waisted fared trousers, homemade tattoos – other popular culture passes them by. Which means that John (Elliot James Langridge) doesn’t go to the pictures, so he misses out on the origins of the genre he inhabits by not catching Claude Whatham’s _That’ll Be the Day_ (1973) – which beat George Lucas’s _American Graffiti_ to UK cinemas by a few months and remains the template for the mix of teenage rebellion, nostalgic tie-in soundtrack and historical recreation that _Northern Soul_ sticks to very closely.

‘I don’t know if you’ve noticed,’ says guru-like DJ Ray Henderson (James Lance), trying to get John to ditch his loose-cannon best friend Matt, ‘but this is Northern Soul not northern arsehole.’ Besides the music and displays of disco dancing (and proto-breakdance foor-spinning) that owe as much to the fight stylings of Bruce Lee (a onetime cha-cha champion) as the strutting of the Soul Train generation, the heart of the film is the relationship between more-or-less reasonable John and out-of-control Matt (Josh Whitehouse), which seems like a milky-tea echo of the Charlie and Johnny friendship of _Mean Streets_ (1973).

_Northern Soul_ isn’t as explicitly gay as Isaac Julien’s 1977-set _Young Soul Rebels_ (1991), but housemates John and Matt have a lot of shirtless embraces, blazing rows and reconciliations. John gets an outside romance with Antonia Thomas’s interesting if under-characterised nurse; when he shyly admits that he doesn’t know any other Black people like her, she tells him that she doesn’t either, since she’s been marooned in a mostly white county by an American father. The laddish, aggressive, pill-popping Matt, meanwhile, is seemingly celibate, though he is instantly jealous when John becomes friendly with Sean (Jack Gordon), a cockney who is even more committed to Northern Soul than the locals and similarly doesn’t have women in his life.

Early on, the film plays up John’s teenage anger, both at his meek parents for letting a beloved grandfather (Ricky Tomlinson) die in a tyrannical old folks’ home, and at an education system in which he is patronised by an uncaring teacher (Steve Coogan). A historical element that might prove baffling to contemporary audiences is that the hero can storm out of his CSE exams, instantly land a job in a biscuit factory and earn enough to support himself – grim and grinding at the time, this was a period of available jobs for the young unqualified. Sean bursts into the film – amusingly paranoid that every drug buyer is a possible undercover policeman, but ultimately proved correct in his worries – and crashes out, adding a variant accent and shaking up the scene. There’s even a nostalgia here for non-lethal drug habits, though Sean cautions against injecting amphetamines rather than swallowing pills.

_That’ll Be the Day_ (loosely based on the teenage years of John Lennon) and _American Graffiti_ end with their lead characters moving out of the bubble of their subculture, fated to become either a pop star (as shown in _That’ll Be the Day_’s sequel, _Stardust_) or a ‘writer in California’. _Northern Soul_ is smaller-scale: John might go on to be as big in Wigan as Ray Henderson, but mostly he gets through his angry patch (he even reconciles with his parents) and settles into his twenties without compromising his musical tastes.

Rather sweetly, this is a peculiarly English time-capsule of a film, suggesting that the Northern Soul scene meticulously recreated here (the end credits list dozens of folks who have lent their expertise to the project) is an Edenic eternal moment, like the Hundred Acre Wood or 221B Baker St.
