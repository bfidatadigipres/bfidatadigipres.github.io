This gripping and atmospheric Irish psychological drama asks how far you might go to protect someone you love, even if they were accused of something unforgiveable. In a windswept fishing town on the Irish coast, factory worker Aileen’s days are brightened when, out of the blue, her prodigal son Brian returns home, after seven long years living abroad. However, her joy is cut short when one of her co-workers accuses Brian of sexual assault, creating divisions in the town’s close-knit community and within Aileen herself.

Emily Watson, Paul Mescal and Aisling Franciosi, who each garnered British Independent Film Award nominations, deliver devastating performances. Saela Davis and Anna Rose’s gripping, beautifully shot and richly scored film is wracked with tension and dread.

Powered by quietly intense performances and incisive, exquisite filmmaking, _God’s Creatures_ enters the life of a small, windswept Irish fishing village and a family whose bonds are as tumultuous as the sea upon which their survival depends. From those relentless elements emerges a gripping story, epic in its moral dimensions. The tale begins as Brian O’Hara returns home to his family’s hardscrabble oyster farm after seven estranged years abroad. But a mother’s answered prayer becomes her cross to bear. When Brian is accused of a terrible crime, his mother, Aileen, instinctively lies to protect him. Self-sacrifice and defense of one’s own define her maternal identity. As the consequences ripple through the village and tensions long left unspoken bubble to the surface, the film reveals a mother’s stoic devotion and its tragic undoing.

Few sons ever reappear in this coastal village of fading opportunity. It’s a place haunted by acts never accounted for, secrets never told, apologies never uttered – by memories as restless and unsettled as apparitions. It’s also a place of stark self-preservation, where the local fishermen purposely refuse to learn to swim, despite the constant perils of drowning, lest they be obligated to risk their lives to rescue others. Aileen is overjoyed to see her prodigal son come home to revive the family business, no matter how precarious. She watches with pleasure as he falls back into the elemental rhythms of the tides and the balm of hard work. But when the police inform her that Brian is suspected of sexually assaulting her factory co-worker, it is Aileen who finds herself in an accelerating nightmare. Caught between love, shame, and the urge to protect what little she has in the world, Aileen must reckon with the silence and denial that have long held sway in the village.

Directing partners Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer weave a poetic tapestry of intersecting relationships: mother and son, past and present, humanity and nature. They tell a story of reckoning that feels of a piece with the craggy mercilessness and dark wit of the Irish coast. They bring a unique vision that is tender and unflinching, at once authentic to the place and alive with rich, luminous color – a vision that takes the story full circle to two defining moments: one of harrowing surrender and another of affirming reclamation. The directors were captivated by the achingly beautiful screenplay by Shane Crowley. But most of all they were drawn to Aileen.

‘Aileen really moved us because she felt like someone we’d not experienced before in this way. We saw an opportunity to deconstruct and re-imagine the archetype of a mother constrained to the role of bystander by placing her at the centre of our narrative,’ says Davis. Continues Holmer, ‘It was Aileen’s story, her psychology, and her change of heart that inspired us to make a film where the lives of the women in particular are full and thorough, where their interior lives are as cinematic as those sweeping vistas.’

_God’s Creatures_ began as the story does – with the implacable sea. It was the film’s producer, Fodhla Cronin O’Reilly, who first had the notion of looking beneath the maritime charm of an Irish fishing village to the moral complications of the lives within. She grew up in such a fishing village in Kerry, on Ireland’s tempestuous west coast. ‘I wanted to tell a story about the world I came from,’ she says, ‘about the hardships of local fishermen against the cruel sea and how this landscape of crashing waves can make humble lives feel epic. In this primal landscape that seemed to hold us all captive, a disagreement over oyster licenses can carry the stakes of a grand territorial conflict. Here, the mundane and the ordinary seem to stretch into the realm of myth.’

Cronin O’Reilly took a chance on a screenwriter for the project: Shane Crowley, a childhood friend from a neighboring town in Kerry. At the time, Crowley had no professional training, but his long, poetic emails about his travels captivated Cronin O’Reilly with their atmosphere and human insights. “I found Shane’s voice to be so lyrical and distinct,” she says. The two began creating, sparking a process which blossomed into nearly a decade of script development. An idea came into sharp focus as they began to hear more and more stories about women across Ireland who had been disbelieved and effectively ostracised from tight knit communities after making allegations of sexual assault. ‘We were so dumbfounded as to how these women were being treated,’ says Cronin O’Reilly, ‘It felt like these women, women I grew up with, were having their voices stripped away from them just as I was beginning to find my own. I was compelled to use my voice to highlight these stories that require attention.’

They envisioned a story of a mother and son, and a lie that she tells to protect him when he is accused of sexual assault. ‘We wanted to explore male privilege through a mother and son relationship,’ says Crowley. Cronin O’Reilly continues, ‘And to explore the gender politics of our world. A story about the inner conflict of a mother torn between her unconditional love for her son and her own sense of right and wrong. It gave us the opportunity to investigate themes of gender, family, trauma, sexuality, desire, and emigration – and to ask the questions – how could people do this to sexual assault survivors, how could communities treat individuals like this?’
