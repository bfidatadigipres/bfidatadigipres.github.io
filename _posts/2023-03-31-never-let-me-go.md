**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

‘It quietly stays with you, as it’s so intensely thought-provoking. And it’s beautifully shot too.’ – Alex M, BFI Member

Mark Romanek read Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel _Never Let Me Go_ on its publication in 2005, and immediately expressed an interest in filming it. The book has been adapted for the screen by Ishiguro’s friend and fellow novelist Alex Garland (who ‘to a degree Kazuo credits with having an influence on the novel’, Romanek says). It’s set in a version of post-war Britain in which the major scientific breakthroughs were in genetics rather than nuclear physics.

‘The whole fabric of society from 1949 is altered only in that one sense, Romanek explains, “’that human cloning is an accepted fact, just as we accept – or have to put up with – nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.’ The clones, created to be organ donors and destined to ‘complete’ (die) in early adulthood after the second or third extraction, are regarded as less than human, their shortened individual lives a price worth paying for the extension of the average lifespan. More disturbingly still, the clones themselves, brought up in seclusion at Hailsham (in most respects an ordinary English boarding school) and apprised of the reality of their situation in small doses, make no effort to rebel. ‘It’s about the degree to which people don’t tend to try to escape their fates at all,’ says Romanek. In a sense it’s the anti-_X-Men_.

Ishiguro’s novel is narrated in the first person, almost without affect, by Kathy H. (movingly played by Carey Mulligan in the film), one of the more privileged donors who is given the chance to slightly prolong her own life by acting as a ‘carer’ for the others as they undergo their operations, including Ruth (Keira Knightley), her school friend and rival in love for Tommy (Andrew Garfield). The film is also told from Kathy’s perspective; with minimal recourse to voiceover narration (if not quite as minimal as Romanek would have liked) we learn about the nature of her world as she does. ‘You’ve been told and not told,’ says one of the Hailsham teachers (Sally Hawkins), setting up the film’s essential question: how far the donors’ lack of control truly separates them from the rest of humanity. Romanek calls the film ‘a love story with a subtle patina of science fiction’; like Fincher’s _The Curious Case of Benjamin Button_ (2008), it uses a sci-fi conceit to sharpen its abnormal protagonists’ exposure to normal experience.

For Romanek, the clones’ unwillingness to try to escape their fate is ‘completely evident and implicit’. ‘They’ve been brainwashed since they were children to believe that what they’re doing for this alternative society is a tremendous honour and privilege,’ he explains. ‘People who are told they have six months to live don’t go and climb Machu Picchu. People stay in marriages they’re not happy in and jobs they don’t like. People don’t tend to run, and that’s probably an uncomfortable thing to hold a mirror up to.’

This kind of cognitive dissonance has an immediate political dimension that Romanek says is ‘only a few ticks away’ from Ishiguro’s fiction. ‘The clothes we’re wearing today were probably created by people whose circumstances are infinitely less fortuitous than ours, and we know that, but we go on wearing the clothes. The film asks: when you can’t push that notion to the back of your mind any more, what becomes important? How do you come to the end of your life and not regret how you lived?’

As in the novel, Kathy’s first-person narrative gives the film a very restricted point of view, yet Romanek insists that he was never tempted to show what Kathy doesn’t tell us. ‘First of all, I didn’t know how I would do it – I just had a strong, instinctive connection and wanted to make a movie of what I’d read,’ he says. ‘Tonally I thought it would be very fresh. I always respond to first-person things – and Polanski does this better than anybody: the single point of view that never veers off. To me there’s a gemlike purity about films that do that – they’re very rare, but you can find them. So my instinct would never be to be more third-person. [The first-person approach] poses a lot of challenges, but you can crack them. Look at _Rosemary’s Baby_ or _The Pianist_ – I don’t think they break point of view once.’

The constrained or skewed consciousness is the thread that unites Romanek’s three features, and _Never Let Me Go_, he says, breaks from its protagonist’s point of view perhaps once or twice, on neither occasion significantly. Because we see it through Kathy’s mostly incurious eyes, the version of 1980s England that _Never Let Me Go_ presents is far from dystopian, but there is something subtly alienating in the background when the donors venture out into the world.

‘I like creating little rules, so that it feels like there’s an architecture about things,’ Romanek says. ‘But it’s our England, so to speak. We toyed around in the design process with having more overt science-fiction tropes, because initially I thought that that’s part of the fun of it – that it’s ostensibly a science-fiction film. But every time it came up, it just never felt right – it felt mannered or distracting.’

Taking his lead from Ishiguro (who was born in Japan but brought up in England after his parents moved here), Romanek prepared by (re-)exposing himself to post-war Japanese cinema – Naruse, Ozu – ‘because if you overlaid that on to a very British story, it would give it a very Ishiguro tone.’ It’s a piece of recontextualisation that recalls his Satellite years [Satellite Films – a division of Propaganda, the production house Romanek cofounded by David Fincher], but that – given the story deals with universal themes – makes one wonder whether it needed to be filmed in England at all. Romanek, however, sees an inherently British angle to the story. ‘There is something about dealing with such big, universal themes in a restrained and understated manner that is – to generalise – a British type of sensibility,’ he points out. ‘I’ve worked here several times, and had an affinity for the place. I had the advantage of being an outsider. I also had a lot of help – I was surrounded by British people who told me when I was veering off course.’

Romanek’s England in _Never Let Me Go_, successfully meshed with Ishiguro’s, is an estranged vision of a country that itself veered off; but rather than offering a warning about what we might accept, it’s a parable about what we already do.
