Whichever way you look at it, _The Godfather_ trilogy – thanks to its first two superlative instalments – undoubtedly ranks as one of the most highly respected achievements in filmmaking of the last half century.

I first saw the original film shortly after its initial release and was certainly impressed by its scale and sobriety. But it wasn’t until a second viewing in the mid-70s, by which time I had changed from an ordinary, fairly regular filmgoer into a full-blown cinephile watching an average of around half a dozen movies each week, that I saw it again and came to recognise more of its virtues (and, indeed, more of its flaws).

In the meantime, I’d had the chance to see _The Godfather Part II_. This was just as I was falling head-over-heels in love with film as an artform (as opposed to the mere entertainment I’d been looking for as a schoolkid), and I was knocked out. It was a time when I was discovering the work of Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa and Yasujio Ozu, not to mention what seemed to be distinctly un-Hollywoodian American films by the likes of Robert Altman, Arthur Penn, Dennis Hopper, Sam Peckinpah, Terrence Malick and Bob Rafelson. And the _Godfather_ films – especially the second one – seemed to mesh perfectly with the seductive combination of innovative art and adult entertainment purveyed by these directors.

Why Part II even more than Part I? For more than 40 years now, I’ve rated the sequel more highly than the original, even if it doesn’t have Marlon Brando to lend it his peculiar brand of mythic grandeur. I like the first film enormously, for the performances by that extraordinary cast (besides Brando and Al Pacino, there’s James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, not to mention two more superb veterans in Richard Conte and the inimitable Sterling Hayden); for Gordon Willis’ brooding cinematography; for Dean Tavoularis’ art direction; for the carefully crafted dialogue, the measured pace and the stately sense of family ritual.

But _The Godfather Part II_ has nearly all that (sadly, the veterans are no longer in the cast, though you do get the Actors’ Studio’s near-legendary Lee Strasberg as a welcome addition) and more – and I don’t just mean Robert De Niro, at his most hauntingly beautiful as the young Vito Corleone.

There lies the key to the film’s superiority and greatness: it’s both sequel and prequel, extending the original film’s timeframe both backwards to Vito’s arrival in New York from Sicily at the start of the 20th century and forwards to his son Michael’s ruthless protection of his own authority as family capo during a period of expansion into Las Vegas, Cuba and elsewhere.

Where the first film was to some extent simply about the constant conflict between the Corleones on the one hand and competing clans and corrupt cops on the other – with, by the way, the existence of innocent victims of organised crime barely if ever acknowledged – its successor is about something more dynamic: the changes that take place not only in the Corleones (and, more particularly, within Michael himself) but in America itself.

The pernicious and increasing influence of organised crime on ordinary people (including, initially, young Vito, his wife and children) and on the so-called bastions of society – not just the police but the politicians and judiciary – becomes a dominant theme of the film, which coolly chronicles one family’s inexorable progress from petty to corporate crime, from survival instinct to an icy, self-destructive obsession with power for power’s sake.

It’s why the film is imbued with such a strong undertow of melancholy; it’s there, calm and chilling, in Michael’s eyes. And it’s that melancholy, that almost tragic self-awareness about what might have been and all that has been lost, that makes _The Godfather Part II_ far, far more than just another gangster movie.  
**Geoff Andrew, bfi.org.uk, 20 February 2014**  

_The Godfather Part II_ premieres in New York in December 1974 and it is everything Coppola has promised it would be; the film achieves a near-perfect balance between art and commerce, pleasing fellow artists, critics, filmgoers and executive at Paramount. It wins Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted from Other Material, Best Art Direction and Best Music, Original Score. By the time its first run is complete, _The Godfather Part II_ earns a healthy profit as well: close to $60 million in domestic box-office revenues off a $13 million budget.

The widely read _New Yorker_ reviewer Pauline Kael, who in 1969 wrote in exasperation that Hollywood had ‘devolved into  rotting system in which mediocrity and skyrocketing costs work together to turn out films that would have a hard time making money even if they were good’, lauds _The Godfather Part II_ as a turning point for the director and for an emerging New Hollywood: _The Godfather Part II_ is the work of a major artist… who else, when he got the chance and power, would have proceeded with the absolute conviction that he’d make the film the way it should be made? In movies, that’s the inner voice of an authentic hero.’ Writing for the _LA Times_, Charles Champlin is similarly effusive: ‘The creative, aesthetic success of this long enterprise is, I think, on the heroic scale… in its way, _The Godfather Part II_ is more daring than the original… and the risks were worth taking.’

By the time _The Godfather Part II_ wound up its first run in the late spring of 1975 Coppola was indisputably at the pinnacle of his Hollywood career. But he did not stay there (at the top) for long. Just four years later, he would be the subject of press ridicule when the location shoot of _Apocalypse Now_ clocked its 200th day. The director, paraphrasing Euripides, quipped to his co-workers self-effacingly: ‘Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes successful in show business.’ The remark proved prophetic.

The development and production of _The Godfather_ involved a surfeit of intrigue and conflict. The making of the sequel was a good deal less fraught. Indeed, the mostly cooperative and collaborative development and production of _The Godfather Part II_ rather made the case that an indulgence of an auteur theory – that studio investment in the apparent genius of talented filmmakers – might actually work to the benefit of movie-makers and moneymen alike. _The Godfather Part II_ marks the moment when everything seemed perfect for Coppola and for a new generation of filmmakers… just before things would never be so perfect for any of them again.

_The Godfather Part II_ proved to be a turning point in the New Hollywood because it was also the turning point in the career of the industry’s premier player: Francis Coppola. The director navigated the 1970s American film business expertly. In the space of seven years, he directed three box-office blockbusters (and was credited with a fourth as executive producer), received two Palmes d’Or at Cannes, netted 12 Academy Awards nominations (as producer, director and screenwriter) and took home five Oscar statuettes. His many side-projects – the magazine, the indie distribution and production units, the Directors Company experiment at Paramount and later his purchase of the Hollywood General Studio lot in 980 – at first blush evinced the scale and scope of his ambition, but they also set the stage for his comeuppance: ‘whom God wishes to destroy’, and all that. In 1974, Coppola was Hollywood’s most famous, most important director. And _The Godfather Part II_ is the reason why.
