_+ intro by film historian, Ian Christie_

In these two films by Noël Burch, the processes of image making are interrogated and playfully subverted through a range of inventive and elusive narrative devices. In _Correction Please_ attention is drawn to the way early cinema developed its own mode of language. Then, in _Impersonation_, a documentary exploration of the 1980s British art scene is viewed through the prism of a seemingly missing British artist.

**‘Correction Please’: a contemporary review**  
_Correction Please_ is a consciously unselfcontained work. This is manifest not only in the title (which carries the implicit question, what is being corrected?), but also in the film’s relationship to Burch’s continuing theoretical writings. In fact, he has already ‘amplified’ the film-text with an accompanying written one, designed to ‘clarify incidental obscurities for teachers and other users’ (a collection of notes supplied as a booklet with the film, and also printed in _Afterimage_, No. 8/9). But this open-ended quality is most obvious in the structure of the film itself, which disrupts a straightforward development of beginning, middle and end (very much in that order) with a series of provocative inserts designed to question the ‘innocence’ of that development.

The narrative concerns the mission on which young Williamson is sent by his chief, Hepworth, to deliver a letter to the latter’s arch-enemy, the Countess Skladanowsky. The Countess, in the mansion where she lives with her sinister maid and voyeuristic father, reads the letter and hypnotises the messenger. This series of events is staged (with overlaps and repetition) in five separate sequences which allude, through their formal attributes, to what Burch describes as ‘the mature primitive years (c. 1905), Griffith’s middle period at Biograph (c. 1910), the more mature films which Reginald Barker made for Thomas Ince (c. 1915), Fritz Lang’s _Mabuse_ dyptich (1922) – a crucial moment in the elaboration of the visual and symbolic structures of the Cinema Institution – and, finally, the era of “canned theatre”, insofar as it is that of so many films made between 1929 and today’.

The point of tracing this ‘development’ is not the usual one of celebrating a supposed organic, natural growth from primitivism to sophisticated maturity. Williamson, the spectator’s surrogate within the narrative as such, gradually becomes the victim not just of the Countess but of an ‘interiorisation of the picture as an _environment_, centred around the spectator’s illusory self’. Factors which gradually emerge as the story unfolds, such as ‘linear perspective, camera ubiquity, camera movement, eyeline matching’, contribute to this interiorisation which consequently ‘became inscribed in the social reality of the Institution’. Williamson, the ‘pioneer’, is reduced, in the words of the Countess, to ‘a very susceptible subject’ or, as her father more bluntly describes him, a ‘stupid bourgeois pig’.

This dramatisation of the way ‘cinema language’, as it has come to be understood, has evolved into a regime to which the spectator becomes subject, the ‘Institutional Mode of Representation’ (Burch’s phrase) is, of (polemic) necessity, highly didactic, as well as being staged in a pointedly seductive manner. But the corrective lesson is deliberately made problematic by the material with which it is interwoven, a number of films from the period 1900-1906 which, in the use Burch makes of them, raise more questions about the Institution than his film could possibly answer.

Sometimes the ‘jokes’ are both neat and productive. For example, _Gay Shoe Clerk_ provides, with its ‘literal’ illustration of ‘The Dissecting Eye: Fetishistic Version’ (a Buñuelian close-up of a woman’s shoe being fitted), an image which contradicts the legend recounted earlier on the soundtrack (Griffith as inventor of the close-up) not only chronologically but ideologically. The same legend posits Griffith versus the front office (creativity versus capital); but Burch shifts the significance of this fragment of film ‘grammar’ into a psychoanalytic context inexplicable in those terms.

Similarly, _A Picture for the Rogues Gallery_, in which a grimacing, crying woman gradually comes into bizarre close-up, ‘framed’ by the Law and its gaze (a police photographer), succinctly encapsulates the eye /object relation as ‘a violent intimacy’. But not all the examples are this successful. The pieces of bodies falling from the sky at the climax of _Explosion of a Motor Car_ may be an example of ‘The Dissecting Eye: Primal Version’, but to describe the film as ‘an _acting out_ of the infantile fantasies of aggression... rippings and tearings’ seems arbitrarily reductive. Burch’s thesis that cinema in the days of pre-editing gave a ‘delirious impetus (to the) theme of the “divided body”’ may be sound, but this single example does not _usefully_ support it since he does not follow up the gesture.

The problem is duplicated with _The Bride Retires_, in which an on-screen male voyeur watches his young wife undress, acting out ‘a structure of desire which will ultimately come to be “hidden” (repressed?) in the “language” of the close-up, the lascivious pan, etc.’. The difficulty of the conceptual leap, from a single example to an understanding of the Institution at work, is more serious here since the idea of this structure of desire vitally informs the narrative of Williamson and the Countess, a model of Hollywood /Mosfilm constructed in order to be rejected.

What _Correction Please_ convincingly articulates is the way in which a spectator is taken over by the centring process; what it less convincingly demonstrates is the psychoanalytic significance of that take-over. And in turn, what (almost) remains implicit is the sense of what lies beyond this area. This is hinted at by _The Ingenious Soubrette_, in which pictures are hung by a character crawling up a wall, in defiance of rules of perspective. The caption here is ‘The Unimaginable Angle’, i.e. that which will disappear as the Institution becomes entrenched. The ‘unimaginable’ is only one step away from a kind of radical nostalgia which emerges in Burch’s suggestion of the ‘effort’ required to read films ‘made prior to “the Griffith Revolution”’. This ‘primitive’ cinema has become a field of exploration for theorists/filmmakers interested in ways of seeing outside the dominant mode (Burch links Lumière and Warhol; Ken Jacobs refilms _Tom, Tom the Piper’s Son_). It is from this position that Burch speaks, a fact unacknowledged by his film. Which perhaps explains why _Correction Please_ says more about _Wavelength_ than it does about _Vertigo_, a crucial fact to be borne in mind by ‘teachers and other users’.

**Impersonation. Apropos the Disappearance of Reginald Pepper**
The film endeavours to piece together the story of the disappearance of contemporary English ‘primitive’ artist, Reginald Pepper, after doubts had been raised as to the authenticity of his paintings. Testimony comes from the critic Guy Brett, gallery owners Eric Lister and Andras Kalman and the professional artist Joanna Carrington who acted as his agent.
