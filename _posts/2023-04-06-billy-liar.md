**A contemporary review**  
With _Billy Liar_, John Schlesinger shows us that it is possible to make a film in this country that has movement, energy, grace and charm, that it is possible to make immense comic use of the remarkable Mr Courtenay and to exploit an industrial suburban setting for its absurdly local yet characteristic happenings, for its sense of the light-hearted as well as the drab. Like its central character, Billy Fisher (Tom Courtenay), _Billy Liar_ is a film of many moods, a film of an essential ambiguity of feeling. As Billy’s mind shifts from reality to Ambrosia – his imaginary country where he always has success – the film shifts with him, changing dreariness to farce. Yet, since Billy does not really know how he feels at any particular moment, we are not too sure how we feel about Billy.

While the film is pre-eminently successful in making us laugh, in constantly inventing new comic situations, we cannot help but recognise that Billy’s is essentially a tragic situation. In what is intrinsically a more moving way than Thurber’s Walter Mitty, Billy’s tragedy is the result of his inability to take himself seriously. He can’t manage either to come to grips with his family and his job in the undertaker’s office, or to find the strength to leave them. His Ambrosial fantasies are much too attractive; and it is part of the charm at the centre of his character that his decision never to desert them, in its rejection of harsh reality, is a decision always to remain young. Yet, because the film is so close to its central character, so much a part of his many moods, we recognise his plight without ever feeling its impact. Like Billy, we find it more agreeable just to sit back and laugh.

There is another problem too, that makes our response more superficial than it might have been. Like Billy, the film rarely takes itself seriously: even in his daily life, there are constant shifts into fantastication and farce. By making Mr Shadrack (Leonard Rossiter) such an obvious figure of fun, by playing the roles of the grandmother (Ethel Griffies) and of Billy’s ‘bloody’ father (Wilfred Pickles) almost entirely for laughs, the film sacrifices much of its emotional potential. And, at the same time that this element of comic caricature heightens the ambiguity of feeling, it leaves certain scenes dangling, oddly out of place in their context. For instance, the talk with Councillor Duxbury (Finlay Currie) on the moors, silhouetted and strangely symbolic, seems only tenuously related to the rest of the film; as indeed the funeral fantasy, by sharply interrupting the more sombre rhythm of the final sequences and so dispersing our feeling about the old woman’s actual death, certainly detaches us from the potential poignancy of the close. Even the opening shots behind the credits, travelling along rows of suburban dwellings, keeping pace with the Housewife’s Choice which at the moment is playing, although a marvellously lively beginning for a very funny film, seem only obscurely related to Billy’s vanquished march through the streets which closes the picture.

If by the end, then, we feel that we have been more amused than moved by the film, that opportunities have been missed, we certainly carry away some of the joy and excitement that appear to have gone into the making of it. After _Terminus_ and _A Kind of Loving_, _Billy Liar_ represents a more confident achievement for John Schlesinger, who looks very much at home with the challenges of ‘Scope. Although the lack of unity seems a failure in conception, perhaps chiefly in Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall’s script, within individual sequences Schlesinger’s pace scarcely falters and his judgment rarely errs. Most remarkable and most un-British is the zoom-tracking episode when Liz first comes to town. As she swings gaily through the streets, hopping across obstructions and skipping between cars, the camera follows her easily, observing her mugging response to everything she sees. If both Helen Fraser as Barbara and Gwendolyn Watts as Rita are more than adequate to their parts – are indeed perhaps more suited to the caricatured context in which they have been set – Julie Christie as Liz gives, to my mind, the most stunningly attractive female performance that we’ve seen on the British screen. That the strength of her performance, and indeed of her female self, heightens the central implausibility of her attraction to Billy and so further undermines the film’s unity, is perhaps to be regretted. Yet the joyful manner of her presentation is so right for the general spirit of the film, and such a relief from the stodginess of so many British pictures, that I find it difficult to complain.

Finally, of course, the film is Tom Courtenay’s. In this, his finest part so far, no praise could be too much and yet all seems impossible. It’s not just that his body is so limber and his face so minutely expressive: it’s more that just by a hint of an expression, a particular glance of the eyes, we can see that a change of mood is about to begin. Whether engaged in imaginary machine-gun slaughter of the people he feels are thwarting him, or made conscious of his real limitations when face to face with the magnificent Liz, Courtenay’s playing has an intimacy and particularity about it which makes him perpetually fascinating to watch. It is with the help of such performances, plus some enterprising camerawork (Denys Coop), that John Schlesinger has been able to make _Billy Liar_ the most enjoyable film to have come out of the new  British cinema.
