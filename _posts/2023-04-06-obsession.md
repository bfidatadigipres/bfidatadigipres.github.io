_+ panel and Q&A with Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Richard Armitage, Charlie Murphy, Indira Varma and Rish Shah. Chaired by Emma Bullimore._

This thrilling and seductive limited series about erotic obsession and forbidden desire is a contemporary adaptation of Josephine Hart’s bestselling novel _Damage_. It focuses on a dangerous love triangle that emerges when the enigmatic Anna Barton (Murphy) embarks on a passionate affair with her fiancé’s father William (Armitage). Whilst Anna fights to sustain both relationships, William is drawn into an obsessive spiral. How long can they keep their secret hidden before someone gets hurt?

**Morgan Lloyd Malcolm**  is a playwright and screenwriter. She was commissioned by The Globe to write _Emilia_ which  became a hit show in summer 2018 before transferring to the West End in 2019, winning three Olivier  awards. She is currently adapting three of her plays for film, including _Emilia_ and _Mum_. Her adaptation  of her play _The Wasp_ completed filming at the end of 2022 starring Naomie Harris and Natalie Dormer  and directed by Guillem Morales.

April 2023 will see the release of _Obsession_, a four-part drama series for Netflix, an adaptation by Morgan of Josephine Hart’s novel _Damage_, produced by Moonage Pictures and Gaumont UK.

Morgan has worked extensively with Clean Break, a feminist theatre company working with women with experience of prison. Her commission _Typical Girls_, a play set in a women’s prison featuring the music of The Slits, ran at the Sheffield Crucible in 2021. Her new play _Mum_ ran at Plymouth Theatre Royal and Soho Theatre in 2021, with another new play for High Tide, _When the Long Trick’s Over_, which toured last year after a run at the New Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich. She also runs a theatre company called Terrifying Women with Abi Zakarian, Sampira and Amanda Castro which produces new horror plays written by women.

Morgan’s previous plays _Belongings_ and _The Wasp_ were both produced at the Hampstead Theatre and Trafalgar Studios. _Belongings_ was shortlisted for The Charles Wintour Most Promising Playwright Award.

As an actor **Richard Armitage** has appeared in many film, television and stage productions and has recently become a published author for the first time with the publication of the acclaimed thriller _Geneva_ (Audible / Faber & Faber).

After his breakout role as John Thornton in the BBC drama _North & South_, Richard gained momentum on UK shows including _Spooks_ and _Robin Hood_. He achieved international recognition with his performance in the 2011 box office smash Captain _America: The First Avenger_ opposite Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving, before following it up with his iconic performance as Thorin in Peter Jackson’s _The Hobbit_ trilogy, which has grossed over $1 billion to date.

Richard’s more recent TV work includes Bryan Fuller’s reimagining of _Hannibal_ as Francis Dolarhyde and no fewer than three Harlan Corben thrillers for Netflix _Stay Close_, _The Stranger_ and the forthcoming _Fool Me Once_ which he is currently filming in Manchester.

Richard can be seen in the third season of EPIX’s espionage drama, _Berlin Station_ opposite Richard Jenkins and Rhys Ifans. He also appeared as the lead villain in Gary Ross’ movie _Ocean’s Eight_ alongside Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, and Mindy Kaling. Richard also starred in _Pilgrimage_ opposite Tom Holland and Jon Bernthal as well as _Brain on Fire_ (directed by Gerard Barrett) opposite Chloe Grace Moretz.

In the theatre world, Richard appeared in Ian Rickson’s interpretation of _Uncle Vanya_ starring opposite Toby Jones. Richard also delivered a critically acclaimed performance as the lead of Arthur Miller’s modern drama, _The Crucible_, at the Old Vic Theatre. He was nominated for an Olivier Award for his performance. Off Broadway Richard appeared in the play, _Love, Love, Love_ directed by Michael Mayer.

**Charlie Murphy** is an award-winning Irish actress. She can most recently be seen in the final instalment of the BAFTA-winning series, _Happy Valley_  in which Charlie reprised the role of Ann Gallagher; a part which also garnered her an award for Best Supporting Actress at the Irish Film and Television Awards in 2017. The BBC crime drama follows Yorkshire police officer, Catherine, who, whilst battling family demons, discovers the remains of a gangland murder which sparks a chain of events that unwittingly lead her straight back to the dangerous and sadistic Tommy Lee Royce.

Charlie will star alongside Richard Armitage as the lead in her latest project, Netflix’s upcoming three-part thriller series, _Obsession_, which will air on the streaming platform in April.

Filming is currently underway for the new season of cult series _Halo_. Charlie plays Makee in the highly anticipated sci-fi series for Paramount+, based on the wildly popular videogame of the same name, which premiered last year. Dramatising the epic 26th-century conflict between humanity and an alien threat known as the Covenant, the series is a ‘visually stunning thrill-ride, anchored in riveting, character-driven storytelling.’

Channel 5 four-part noir thriller _Deadline_, which also stars James D’Arcy, was released last year. When Natalie (Charlie) stands accused of murdering her husband in cold blood, a disgraced investigative journalist finds himself captivated by the case. Charlie also appeared in the second series of the hugely popular surveillance thriller, _The Capture_, for BBC One alongside Holliday Grainger and Paapa Esseidu.

In 2020 Charlie was seen in _The Winter Lake_  opposite Emma Mackey. Set in rural Ireland, this damp and claustrophobic thriller follows troubled teenager Tom, who discovers a sack in a shallow lake containing the bones of a human baby. Her other film credits include Yann Demange’s multi-award winning ‘71, Stephen Frears _Philomena_, The _Foreigner_ directed by Martin Campbell, _The Corrupted_  alongside Sam Claflin and Timothy Spall and _Dark Lies The Island._

Charlie is also recognised as an IFTA winner in the Best Supporting Actress category for her role in the hugely popular series _Peaky Blinders_. Additionally, she played Anne Bronte in _Walk Invisible: The Bronte Sisters_  for Sally Wainwright, a series lead _in Love/Hate_  for which Charlie won Best Actress at the IFTAs both in 2013 and 2015, and _The Village_  alongside Maxine Peake and John Simm. Other TV credits include _The Last Kingdom_, _Rebellion_ and _Ripper Street_.

Charlie’s extensive talents extend beyond TV and film; her stage credits include Enda Walsh’s _Disco Pigs_  (Young Vic), Mark O’Rowe’s _Our Few and Evil Days_  (The Abbey Theatre), Enda Walsh’s  _Arlington_  (St Ann’s Warehouse, NY/The Abbey Theatre), an Irish Times Theatre Award winning  performance in _Pygmalion_  (The Abbey Theatre) and most recently Michael Grandage’s _The Lieutenant of Inishmore_, by Martin McDonagh (West End).

Since graduating from the renowned Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), **Indira Varma** has carved out an incredible career on stage and screen. She became the first woman of Indian/South Asian heritage to win a major award at the Olivier Theatre Awards in 2021. She won ‘Best Actress in a Supporting Role’ for her enthralling performance as ‘Liz Essendine’ in _Present Laughter_ at the Old Vic, opposite Fleabag’s Andrew Scott.

Last year, she starred as Tala in _Obi-Wan Kenobi_ (Disney+) alongside Ewan McGregor, Moses Ingram, Hayden Christensen, Joel Edgerton and Rupert Friend. She appeared as Irina Arkadina on stage in Jamie Lloyd’s magnificent production of Chekhov’s _The Seagull_: ‘Indira Varma was in peak form as the charismatically self-regarding actress, Arkadina’ (_New York Times_) opposite _Game of Thrones_ Emilia Clarke in the West End. She ended 2022 playing fierce Newsnight anchor Khadija Khan in the 2nd thrilling series of _The Capture_ (BBC/AMC) alongside _I May Destroy You_’s Paapa Essiedu and Holliday Grainger.

Varma stars in the Apple TV anthology series _Extrapolations_ playing Gita Mishra, currently streaming on the Apple TV+. Varma will also star as ‘Ingrid’ in Netflix’s _Obsession_, an adaptation of the famous feature film _Damage_ originally starring Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche and Miranda Richardson in 1992.

Further screen credits include the feature _Crisis_ with Gary Oldman; _Official Secrets_ (eOne) with Keira Knightley; Ellaria Sand in the multi award-winning international phenomenon _Game of Thrones_ (HBO/SkyAtlantic), Ridley Scott’s _Exodus Gods and Kings_ (20th Century Fox), the iconic British satirical comedy _Spitting Image_ (Britbox), _Luther_ alongside Idris Elba (BBC/Netflix), _Silk_ (BBC), _Rome_ (HBO), _Human Target_ (Fox), _Paranoid_ (Netflix); the Emmy nominated drama _Patrick Melrose_ (HBO/Sky Atlantic) starring Benedict Cumberbatch; critically acclaimed comedy series _This Way Up_ (Channel 4/Hulu) and the ABC drama _for life_, co-starring Nicholas Pinnock, Kid Cudi, and produced by 50 Cent, based on the real life story of Isaac Wright, Jr.

In her prolific theatre career, Indira has starred as Queen Marguerite in the National Theatre’s production of Eugène Ionesco’s _Exit the King_ opposite Rhys Ifans; Shakespeare’s _Titus Andronicus_ (Globe Theatre); opposite Ralph Fiennes in _Man and Superman_; Bianca in _Othello_, _Ivanov_ (all at the National Theatre), _Twelfth Night_, _The Vortex_, _Dance of Death_, _Privates on Parade_ (all at the Donmar Warehouse), _The Vertical Hour, The Country, Ingredient X_ (all at the Royal Court), _Hysteria_ (Theatre Royal), _The Skin of Our Teeth_ (Young Vic) and _Celebration_ (on Broadway). She starred in one of the UK’s first theatrical  events during the Covid 19 pandemic at London’s Old Vic, in Brian Friel’s _Faith Healer_ ‘a  superb Indira Varma in this enthralling streaming production’ (_New York Times_), which was streamed  live to our homes in absence of a live audience. The three-hander also starred Michael Sheen and  David Threlfall.

Named one of _Variety_’s ‘10 Brits to Watch,’ **Rish Shah** is a rising talent. Shah will next be seen in the Netflix limited thriller series _Obsession_. He recently completed production on the feature film _The Sweet East_ opposite Talia Ryder and Jacob Elordi, directed by Sean Price Williams. He will also be seen in the Amazon Studios’ romantic comedy _Sitting in Bars_ _with Cake_ opposite Bette Midler and Yara Shahidi.

Last year, Shah joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe and made his debut as superpowered teen Kamran in the Disney+ series _Ms. Marvel_, which currently boasts a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Shah made his feature film debut in 2021 as Ravi in the Netflix film _To All the Boys: Always and Forever_, followed by playing Varun Dutta in the romantic comedy film _India Sweets and Spices_ opposite Sophia Ali. He then went on to play Russ opposite Maya Hawke and Camila Mendes in the Netflix hit teen comedy film _Do Revenge_, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. He also appeared in Riz Ahmed’s Oscar winning short film _The Long Goodbye_.

Shah made his professional stage debut in London playing Alan in the critically-acclaimed production of _Torch Song Trilogy_ at London’s Turbine Theatre, directed by Olivier Award-winning Drew McOnie.
