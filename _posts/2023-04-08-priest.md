_Priest_ arrived as the Catholic Church was under intense media scrutiny, with an ongoing ‘paedophile priest’ scandal and the ‘outing’ of a number of allegedly homosexual priests by gay pressure group Outrage. _Priest_, though, had a tortured 12-year history behind it, beginning as a rejected storyline for _Brookside_, on which lapsed-Catholic writer Jimmy McGovern served his TV apprenticeship, before expanding to a ten-part take on the Ten Commandments. In 1991, the BBC commissioned a three-part (later four-part) series, only to axe the project after some eight drafts. It was thanks to that rejection that McGovern threw himself so ferociously into _Cracker_, and it was thanks to that series’ success that the BBC suddenly rediscovered its interest in _Priest_, now proposed as a cinema feature.

During his research, McGovern interviewed a gay priest, whose sexual and spiritual torment was exacerbated by his extreme political and moral conservatism. His story became that of Father Greg, who arrives in inner-city Liverpool when his predecessor is unceremoniously ‘retired’ and soon clashes with the older, _Guardian_-reading Father Matthew, who scandalises Father Greg with his openly political stance on poverty and deprivation and his relationship with housekeeper Maria, in breach of his vows of celibacy. Greg’s moral outrage, however, is undermined when he finds himself charged with public indecency after a gay fling.

Father Greg’s faith, meanwhile, is tested when he learns of a young girl’s incestuous abuse but is powerless to stop it thanks to the sacred seal of the confession. Helpless and desperate, he looks to Christ, but sees in His crucified form not salvation but ‘a naked man, utterly desirable.’ The truth is finally revealed thanks not to divine intervention but human weakness, when Greg, distracted, ends a church meeting early, allowing the girl’s mother to return home and discover her husband’s abuse. The revelation, however, only isolates Father Greg further.

With its powerful themes, _Priest_ was bound to provoke. Barred from Liverpool churches, director Antonia Bird (who had shown a taste for confrontational material with her 1993 homelessness drama, _Safe_) filmed some scenes in London. The American Catholic League issued an 11-page condemnation of the film, accusing it of attempting ‘to convince the public of the Catholic Church’s malevolence,’ and launching a boycott against Disney, parent company of _Priest_’s US distributor, Miramax. The UK’s Catholic newspaper _The Tablet_, however, thought it ‘well-made, honest, courageous and sensitive’.

**‘Priest’: a contemporary review**  
Snorting like a bull limbering up for the matador, an elderly priest levels the wooden beam he’s carrying and charges full-tilt at the elegantly diamond-paned windows of the Bishop’s palace. His improvised battering-ram is a five foot crucifix. Outrageous, powerful and brutally funny, the pre-credit sequence of _Priest_ gives fair warning of what’s in store: a none-too-subtle but trenchant assault on the smug hypocrisies of our time, using organised religion, and specifically the Catholic church, as the chosen blunt instrument.

Jimmy McGovern, here making his debut as a feature film writer, has never scrupled to show his hand, and the sermon he puts in the mouth of the radical Fr Matthew makes it clear enough where he thinks the Church should be standing: ‘If you exploit your workforce, shut down schools and hospitals… aren’t you interfering in Creation and spitting in the face of God?’ ‘That wasn’t a sermon, it was a party political broadcast for the Labour Party,’ comments Greg sourly. But the film pitilessly exposes the futility of his own attempts at priestly duties, gabbling Last Unction over an insensible body on a speeding hospital trolley, or embarking on an ill-fated round of pastoral visits. (Gratified at last, after countless slammed doors and obscenities, to be invited in, he finds himself faced with two Jehovahs Witnesses eager to make converts.)

Not that _Priest_ attacks religion as such; if anything, it affirms the validity of faith by setting it against a backdrop of those who abuse it, the time-servers and bigots – recalling G. K. Chesterton’s comment that Christianity wasn’t tried and found wanting, but found difficult and not tried. The film never descends to facile anti-religious jibes, and even – by tight cross-cutting between Greg’s desperate prayer and Mrs Unsworth catching her incestuous husband in the act – hints at the possibility of direct divine intervention. In the final reel Greg, forgiven by the abused child Lisa, achieves something close to a Bressonian grace.

Bressonian austerity, though, is in fairly short supply. This final scene already packs a massive emotional punch: garnishing it with a solo piano rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ might be thought to verge on overkill. Still, lapses like this scarcely matter, given the fury and savage humour of McGovern’s writing and the energy of Antonia Bird’s direction. Bird draws from her cast – especially Tom Wilkinson as Matthew and Christine Tremarco as Lisa – performances of raw intensity, but the film’s most chilling moment goes to Robert Pugh as Lisa’s father, justifying himself (‘It’s the one thing we’d all like to do’) with wet-lipped relish. The Catholic hierarchy probably won’t be any too pleased about _Priest_. They should be, though – if only for a film that pays religion the compliment of taking it so seriously.
