A modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller starring Jeremy Irons, _Dead Ringers_ will feature Rachel Weisz playing the double-lead role of Elliot and Beverly Mantle, twins who share everything: drugs, lovers, and an unapologetic desire to do whatever it takes – including pushing the boundaries on medical ethics – in an effort to challenge antiquated practices and bring women’s healthcare to the forefront. The series’ ensemble cast also includes Britne Oldford as Genevieve, Poppy Liu as Greta, Michael Chernus as Tom, Jennifer Ehle as Rebecca, and Emily Meade as Susan.

Amazon gave a straight-to-series order to the project from Weisz, Alice Birch, lead writer of Hulu’s acclaimed _Normal People_ series, Annapurna Television and Morgan Creek Entertainment.
