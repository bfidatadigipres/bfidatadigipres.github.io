Appropriately coming from a filmmaker who has endured his own share of troubles, _Essential Killing_ deals with survival against the odds. Premiered to acclaim at the Venice Film Festival, Jerzy Skolimowski’s challengingly visceral film shows a man caught on the run in his sun-beaten, desert home and transported far away to a freezing, snow-clad forest, where he escapes his captors and then has to fend for himself against other humans and animal life. But there is more detail to be glimpsed than that. The opening landscapes could be Afghanistan, the men in uniform speak English in American accents, the workers in the forest are speaking Polish, and our mute central figure – incarnated by a raggedly hirsute Vincent Gallo – experiences flashbacks to an Islamic world, accompanied by readings from the Koran.

Is the Polish-born, now once again Polish-resident Skolimowski having his _mazurek_ and eating it? The fact that his film aims not to make any political statement has aroused suspicion, but he remains resolute about his ambiguous, poetic approach. ‘I live in a really remote area of wild forest in Masuria,’ he says. ‘Of course I was aware that in my neighbourhood there is a secret military airport where CIA planes most likely landed. It was a widespread rumour that is now practically confirmed. The Lithuanian government admitted that they had such bases, so it was the turn of the Poles. One winter night I was driving back home, and though my car is pretty solid – a four-wheel drive – I skidded off the road. I nearly rolled over down the slope, but stopped at the last moment. And I realised that I was close to that secret airport – that I was on the same road on which they most likely transported those prisoners in a kind of convoy. So I thought if that could happen to me, it could happen  to anyone.’

Skolimowski’s original conceit of filming entirely in Poland was expanded to include Israel for the desert scenes and also Norway to guarantee the snow, but that didn’t change his viewpoint. ‘To me the story is not who he is, or whether he is guilty or innocent, but the fact this man is barefoot, in chains, in the snow in the forest. This is the story – the process of him turning into an animal.’

The casting of Vincent Gallo in the central role came out of an encounter at the Cannes Film Festival, where the director gave the actor the script. Two hours later Gallo said yes, claiming that wintry conditions didn’t scare off a man brought up in Buffalo. Skolimowski now laughs at the idea: ‘Buffalo can’t have been that severe! In Norway, sometimes it was minus 35 Celsius. With night shooting that really was difficult. We tried to take as much care as possible, but he wasn’t easy. Vincent is a Method actor, and playing such a part – one man against everybody else – he kind of accumulated that in his private life as well. There were some conflicts, delicately speaking. But I can’t blame him – the circumstances were very, very tough. The character he played required this attitude. What really counts is the final result, and on the screen he’s just phenomenal.’  
**David Thompson, _Sight and Sound_, April 2011**

Against the odds, the second short film about killing from a Polish master proves almost as compelling as the first. Jerzy Skolimowski’s film deliberately excludes the sociological dimension of _A Short Film about Killing_, but its play with offscreen realities and genre does put it within shouting distance of Kieslowski’s ‘cinema of moral anxiety’. As usual Skolimowski focuses on the struggles of a loser, this time a jihadi in Afghanistan who is arrested and tortured by US forces after killing three ‘enemy combatants’. He’s unable to explain to his infidel jailers that he’s lost his hearing at least temporarily because of a missile blast. An accident allows him to escape while he is being ‘rendered’ and he finds himself on the run in the harsh Polish winter. Motivated only by his survival instinct, he kills three or four more people and a dog to win himself a few more hours or days of life. But his situation is fundamentally hopeless, and his end is inevitable.

The genre elements in _Essential Killing_ have given it the label of ‘survival drama’. But there’s nothing heroic about this anonymous jihadi. (He’s never given a name on the soundtrack, only in the cast list in the end credits.) The film is anything but triumphalist, and it’s hardly a celebration of the indomitable human spirit. Skolimowski has long specialised in challenging viewers not to empathise with fundamentally unsympathetic characters, and he starts here from the awareness that the jihadi’s plight will trigger sympathy for purely circumstantial reasons. He periodically takes us inside the man’s head: first to convey his panic at going deaf, second to show his attempts to reassure himself that he was acting on Allah’s will by killing men in Afghanistan, and third to suggest that sentimental memories of a wife and child (or are they self-pitying dreams of what might have been?) prime his instinct to battle on through the snows and forests – and, crucially, to kill again. These glimpses of what’s going on in an increasingly unhinged mind merely underline that this man sees himself as being at war; in their stylised way, they’re part of the film’s realist foundations, anchoring the story in the realities of the ‘war on terror’ and ‘extraordinary rendition’. The truth of this backstory prevents the film from becoming a vacuous fable in the vein of Losey’s all-too-abstract _Figures in a Landscape_. The recognisable political context meshes with our memories of war movies and hunters-and-hunted plots to provide a charged fictional terrain on which Skolimowski can raise questions about humanity and inhumanity.

To call them ‘questions’, though, is probably overstating the case. The film’s real achievement is to blur the line between detachment and involvement: to create a situation in which the viewer feels close to a dying protagonist while at the same time remaining free to judge his evermore-desperate actions.  The strategy is in some ways analogous with Hitchcock’s fondness for generating unease by manipulating audiences into identifying with flawed and potentially villainous characters, but the only recent film that comes to mind as working in quite this way – with similar moral anxieties built into its structure and method – is Jia Zhangke’s _Xiao Wu_, another empathetic portrait of a loser who finally vanishes from his own film.

Skolimowski made no films between 1991 and 2008 (he says he spent the time painting), and was apparently nudged back into the fray by acting in Cronenberg’s _Eastern Promises_. It’s interesting that his two ‘comeback’ films are both in some sense responses to the most popular films in Kieslowski’s _Dekalog_: the exploration of desire and voyeurism in _Four Nights with Anna_ (2008) plays like a commentary on the subtexts in _A Short Film about Love_, while this film, as we’ve noted, reframes the moral issues behind _A Short Film about Killing_. Skolimowski, though, is the ‘wild man’ that the urbane Kieslowski never could be, and in Vincent Gallo he’s found an actor to match his own fearlessness. _Essential Killing_ would be much less powerful if it didn’t show the jihadi’s physical sufferings with such visceral immediacy, and if the realism weren’t strong enough to deliver surrealist shocks like the staggering final image.
