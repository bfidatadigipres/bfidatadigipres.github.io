_+ intro and discussion_

Set in London – but mostly filmed in West Germany – at the end of the 1960s, _Deep End_ explores the space between fantasy and reality, as teenage swimming pool attendant Mike (Moulder-Brown) finds himself drawn to his more worldly-wise colleague Susan (Asher). Jerzy Skolimowski’s coming of age story has a strong sense of time and place and a shock ending.

The post screening discussion will be hosted by film and culture writer and Autism Through Cinema Podcast  
co-host Lillian Crawford.
