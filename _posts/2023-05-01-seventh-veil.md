Muriel Box was the first woman to win the Oscar™ for Best Original Screenplay (shared with her husband Sydney), for this story inspired by her fascination with new methods of therapy. When a young pianist attempts suicide, her treatment by hypnosis reveals what is behind the ‘seventh veil’ of her subconscious and helps her choose between the four men who are in love with her.

One of James Mason’s most indelible contributions to British cinema was the moment in which he smashed his cane down on concert pianist Ann Todd’s hands. Given the date (1945) and the motive (obsessive jealousy), it sounds as though it came from one of the many Gainsborough costume melodramas that helped establish Mason as the era’s biggest British star, but _The Seventh Veil_ was in fact made independently by producer Sydney Box, its glossy sheen belying the relatively low budget (under £100,000) and rapid shooting schedule

However, the film largely adopted the Gainsborough formula of a strongly female-centred narrative revolving around a troubled and complex relationship with a brooding, aloof and faintly sadistic man, and emphasised the debt by casting Mason in a familiar role. Here, though, the setting is the present day, and the story is largely told in flashback, with psychiatrist Dr Larson (Herbert Lom) gently but persistently probing the traumatic events in the life of pianist Francesca Cunningham (Todd) in an attempt to help her come to terms with her past, to break through the ‘seventh veil’ which he believes conceals the secret of her various neuroses.

Although the explicitly Freudian explanation of Francesca’s neuroses would probably be dismissed today, this scenario makes for compelling melodrama, the flashback structure serving to present her life as a series of emotional peaks and troughs, her triumphs in the concert hall invariably dashed by romantic disappointment, the resurfacing of unpleasant memories, or her constant paranoia about the sanctity of her hands. In the concert scenes, the latter were doubled by the pianist Eileen Joyce, who generously waived her credit when she saw how convincing the illusion was.

Despite the similarities to its Gainsborough contemporaries, _The Seventh Veil_ was a notably bigger critical success: the _Spectator_ announced it as ‘an event in the development of the British film industry’ and even the notoriously acerbic C.A. Lejeune (_The Observer_) was unusually complimentary. A huge domestic box-office hit (nearly sixty years later, the BFI calculated that it was still the tenth most successful UK box-office hit in terms of ticket numbers), it also made an impact in the US, where its screenplay won an Oscar. The following year, Sydney Box was appointed head of Gainsborough Pictures, on the assumption that he would work similar magic on the ailing studio – but _The Seventh Veil_ turned out to be an unrepeatable one-off.

**Contemporary review**  
Francesca Cunningham is a celebrated pianist whose hands have been burned in a car accident and who is suffering from acute depression. She attempts suicide, and afterwards becomes silent and lifeless. A psychiatrist, Dr Lassen, places her under narco-hypnosis, during which she reveals the truth of her past life, episode by episode. Each stage in her life has led to her depression: the headmistress who canes her on the hands the day before an important music examination, the guardian who tyrannises over her in order to force the pace of her training and career, the collapse of her adolescent and mature love affairs.

James Mason plays his usual role, sardonic, brooding, the man to whom wealth and a mysterious past permit a romantic licence for ill-manners and egocentric behaviour. Yet the film has distinct virtues and distinct cinematic power; the opening is beautifully and brilliantly handled, haunting and tense. The music is a delight to hear (Chopin, Mozart, Grieg, Rachmaninoff, Beethoven). The psychological theme, the neurosis of a talented girl whose thwarted emotional life culminates in an acute regard for her hands, which she wrongly believes injured beyond healing, seems correctly conceived, and the psychiatrist is well played by Herbert Lorn.

James Mason is an excellent actor with a fine face for screen-work. Why must he always play a Victorian maidservant’s conception of a rich, romantically overbearing lord? Ann Todd’s performance is sensitive and true to the character. She performs the difficult task of being completely satisfying and convincing in her portrayal of a great artist in another sphere of art. One went through the artist’s agony of initial public appearance at concerts which demand the highest standards of discipline and execution.
