The leading-figure behind the Scratch Video phenomena of the 1980s, in turn influencing music video, television, alternative film and beyond, George Barber’s influence and standing in British artist and alternative filmmaking is significant. Working across a number of modes, and channelling humour, personal anecdote and a canny appreciation for society’s ever-evolving obsessions and preoccupations, his rich, imaginative work takes many different forms and shapes.

We are thrilled to present a BFI National Archive showcase of new and recent works by Barber. The programme displays his typical eclecticism, musicality and sharp sense of humour while yet again revealing an underlying sensitivity to the alienation that underpins consumerist, modern life. Six films by George Barber to take you to several different places. We also look forward to welcoming Barber for a live, in-person conversation with Barbican curator Matthew Harle.

**George Barber**’s early work on ‘The Greatest Hits of Scratch Video’ is internationally known and has been featured in many galleries and festivals across the world. _The Independent_ and _Sunday Times_ ran features on it, and the tapes, unusually for video art, sold in record shops. His two famous works of the period, ‘Absence of Satan’ and ‘Yes Frank No Smoke’ are screened regularly and many of the other works are considered seminal in the history of British Video Art. Many younger artists, including James Richards and Hanna Perry have acknowledged Barber’s influence.

His work is diverse and over his career, he has had an installation at Tate Britain entitled ‘Automotive Action Painting’ (Film & Video Umbrella) and shows of his video sculptures, ‘The Long Commute’ at Jack the Pelican Presents Gallery Brooklyn, New York. He has also been part of numerous programmes at Tate Modern and had retrospectives at the ICA, New York Film & Video Festival and recently at La Rochelle Festival, France. He has been written about by Paul Morley and Gareth Evans, the _Time Out_ & _Vertigo_ magazine critic. Victor Lewis Smith once devoted a page of the _Evening Standard_ to ‘Upside Down Minutiae’ on 14 Dec 2001 after its broadcast on Channel 4’s Slot Art. Film & Video Umbrella released a monograph. Seventeen Gallery and Anthony Wilkinson have also shown his work. His DVD release from the LUX gained glowing reviews from _Art Forum_, _Art Monthly_ and the _Daily Telegraph_ among others.

Barber is eclectic, his ideas varied. After Scratch, Barber created many low-tech video pieces and was influential in defining an emergent ‘slacker’ aesthetic. Narrative and found footage seem to be at the centre of much of his work, either deconstructing it or trying as an artist to evolve an approach that is contradictory to the maker’s original intention. His ‘Passing Ship’ has been widely screened at festivals, as too his ‘Hovis Advert’ and ‘Walking Off Court’. Barber’s skills as a writer have led him to produce many lyrical works too, including ‘Ansaphone’, ‘Withdrawal’ and ‘River Sky’. ‘River Sky’ toured in, ‘Figuring Landscapes’ starting at the Tate Modern. (Film & Video Umbrella)

His monologues like ‘Refusing Potatoes’ or ‘I Was Once Involved in a Shit Show’ are simple performances that carry the viewer into a genuinely odd confessional world. The monologue form particularly suits Barber as his instinct for the incongruous is appealing. Here, as in Scratch, he is trying to ‘layer’ another of his own stories and thoughts onto someone else’s creation, and piggyback on the original’s cultural familiarity. This project also continues in his latest found footage work, ‘Following Your Heart’ and ‘Losing Faith’ 2008. Both use off-air adverts and TV films, mostly American. The central conceit is to take found footage and manipulate it into a new artistic experience. The adverts and dramas all essentially present clichéd dialogue but by the use of repetition, music, the work rises away from being humdrum television into something more disturbing and effecting. The ingredients of television are inverted and put to new purposes. He has always had a relationship to popular culture and his use of other people’s footage is seen as way of puncturing ideology and getting away from the subjective, the idolised hand of the artist. However, this doesn’t stop his work seeming personal and unique in other aspects.

He has also produced a number of ‘language’ free, conceptual works, like ‘Automotive Action Painting’ and ‘The Shouting Match Series’ or ‘Beyond Language’ which reference early video art yet are original too. ‘Automotive Action Painting’ won First Prize at the 24th Hamburg International Short Film Festival.

‘Gibberish’ attempts to interrupt and convey meaning using nonsense language. ‘Gibberish’ seems to be sense, yet most of the recognisable language spoken is ludicrous and spontaneously thought up. The work starts in a garden with a discussion about lost suitcases at an airport, and over 5 minutes develops through various scenarios into being about a loved kitten and the end of the world.

The first ‘Shouting Match’, is a well-known work that has been shown as a single screen work at the Tate Modern, DCA and Miami Basel. Three other versions have been made, one in Tel Aviv, Bangalore, and New Orleans. This four screen installation of all shouting matches was first shown at Chapter Arts, Cardiff to much acclaim.
