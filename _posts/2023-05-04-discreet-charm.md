**A contemporary review**  
If _Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie_ registers as the funniest Buñuel film since _L’Age d’or_, probably the most relaxed and controlled film he has ever made, and arguably the first contemporary, global masterpiece to have come from France in the Seventies, this is chiefly because he has arrived at a form that covers his full range, permits him to say anything – a form that literally and figuratively lets him get away with murder. One cannot exactly call his new work a bolt from the blue. But its remarkable achievement is to weld together an assortment of his favourite themes, images and parlour tricks into a discourse that is essentially new. Luring us into the deceptive charms of narrative as well as those of his characters, he undermines the stability of both attractions by turning interruption into the basis of his art, keeping us aloft on the sheer exuberance of his amusement.

Seven years ago, Noël Burch observed that in _Le Journal d’une femme de chambre_, Buñuel had at last discovered Form – a taste and talent for plastic composition and a ‘musical’ sense of the durations of shots and the ‘articulations between sequences’; more generally, ‘a rigorous compartmentalisation of the sequences, each of which follows its own carefully worked out, autonomous curve.’ _Belle de Jour_ reconfirmed this discovery, but _Le Charme discret_ announces still another step forward: at the age of 72, Buñuel has finally achieved Style.

Six friends – three men and three women – want to have a meal together, but something keeps going wrong. Four of them arrive at the Sénéchals’ country house for dinner, and are told by Mme Sénéchal that they’ve come a day early; repairing to a local restaurant, they discover that the manager has just died, his corpse laid out in an adjoining room – how can they eat there? – so they plan a future lunch date. But each successive engagement is torpedoed: either  M and Mme Sénéchal (Jean-Pierre Cassel and Stéphane Audran) are too busy making love to greet their guests, or the cavalry suddenly shows up at dinnertime between manoeuvres, or the police raid the premises and arrest everyone. Still other attempted get-togethers and disasters turn out to be dreams, or dreams of dreams. At one dinner party, the guests find themselves sitting on a stage before a restive audience, prompted with lines; another ends with don Raphael (Fernando Rey) shooting his host; still another concludes with an unidentified group of men breaking in and machine-gunning the lot  of them.

At three separate points in the film, including the final sequence, we see all six characters walking wordlessly down a road, somewhere between an unstated starting place and an equally mysterious destination – an image suggesting the continuation both of their class and of the picaresque narrative tradition that propels them forward. Yet if the previous paragraph reads like a plot summary, it is deceptive. The nature and extent of Buñuel’s interruptions guarantee the virtual absence of continuous plot. But we remain transfixed as though we were watching one: the sustained charm and glamour of the six characters fool us, much as they fool themselves. Their myths, behaviour and appearance – a seductive, illusory surface – carry us (and them) through the film with a sense of unbroken continuity and logic, a consistency that the rest of the universe and nature itself seem to rail against helplessly. Despite every attempt at annihilation, the myths of the bourgeoisie and of conventional narrative survive and prevail, a certainty that Buñuel reconciles himself to by regarding it as the funniest thing in the world.

Every dream and interpolated story in the film carries some threat, knowledge or certainty of death – the central fact that all six characters ignore, and their charm and elegance seek to camouflage. Ghosts of murder victims and other phantoms of guilt parade through these inserted tales, but the discreet style of the bourgeoisie, boxing them in dreams and dinner anecdotes, holds them forever in check. To some extent, Buñuel shares this discretion in his failure to allude to his native Spain even once in the dialogue, although the pomp and brutality of the Franco regime are frequently evoked. (The recurrent gag of a siren, jet plane or another disturbance covering up a political declaration – a device familiar from Godard’s _Made in U.S.A._ – acknowledges this sort of suppression.) But the secret of Buñuel’s achieved style is balance, and for that he must lean more on irony – an expedient tactic of the bourgeoisie – than on the aggressions of the rebel classes; when he sought imbalance in _L’Age d’or_, the revolutionary forces had the upper edge. An essential part of his method is to pitch the dialogue and acting somewhere between naturalism and parody, so that no gag is merely a gag, and each commonplace line or gesture becomes a potential gag. Absurdity and elegance, charm and hypocrisy become indistinguishably fused.

Undoubtedly a great deal of credit for the dialogue of _Le Charme discret_ should go to Jean-Claude Carrière, who has worked on the scripts of all Buñuel’s French films since _Le Journal d’une femme de chambre_: the precise banality of the small talk has a withering accuracy. Even more impressive is the way that Buñuel and Carrière have managed to weave in enough contemporary phenomena to make the film as up-to-date – and as surrealistic, in its crazy-quilt juxtapositions – as the latest global newspaper. Vietnam, Mao, Women’s Lib, various forms of political corruption and international drug trafficking are all touched upon in witty and apt allusions. Fernando Rey unloading smuggled heroin from his diplomatic pouch is a hip reference to _The French Connection_, and much of the rest of the film works as a parody of icons and stances in modern cinema. Florence’s neuroticism – as evidenced by her loathing of cellos and her ‘Euclid complex’ – lampoons Ogier’s role in _L’Amour fou_; Audran’s stiff elegance and country house harks back to _La Femme infidèle_; while Seyrig’s frozen, irrelevant smiles on every occasion are a comic variation of her ambiguous _Marienbad_ expressions. And as I’ve already suggested, Godard has become a crucial reference-point in late Buñuel – not only in the parodies and allusions, but also in the use of an open form to accommodate these and other intrusions, the tendency to keep shifting the centre of attention.

A few years ago, Godard remarked of _Belle de Jour_ that Buñuel seemed to be playing the cinema the way Bach played the organ. The happy news of  _Le Charme discret_ is that while most of the serious French cinema at present – Godard included – seems to be hard at work performing painful duties, the  Old Master is still playing – effortlessly, freely, without fluffing a note.
