_Introduced by Zeina Durra_

In Argentine writer-director Lucrecia Martel’s disquieting psychological thriller, a woman collides with something while driving her car. She initially believes she hit a dog, but paranoia grows that the incident may have been more serious. Zeina Durra, the director of _Luxor_ and _The Imperialists Are Still Alive!_, will introduce this immersive, unsettling film, highlighting Martel’s influence on her own work.  
**bfi.org.uk**

Two worlds come into sharp contrast at the beginning of Lucrecia Martel’s third feature _The Headless Woman_, a contemporary thriller where plot gradually gives way to  metaphor. There’s the world of Argentina’s ‘haves’, embodied by the film’s elegant, disengaged protagonist Vero and the privileged bourgeois society she’s part of, and the ‘have nots’, the cleaners and gardeners who labour silently in the background. When Vero fears she may have killed a child from the other side of the tracks, the patriarchs of the family close in to protect their interests. The storm that hangs over the early part of the film may not have wiped away all traces of Vero’s hit-and-run accident but the family will ensure that any evidence is disposed of, decisively and definitely.

While Martel’s previous features, _The Swamp_ (2001) and _The Holy Girl_ (2004), can also be read as allegorical tales of domestic decomposition, _The Headless Woman_ is her most overtly political film to date. Her visual and sonic landscape highlights the social schisms that underpin Argentine society: we see the poor who wait for treatment at the bleak local hospital; the elderly garden-centre attendant and his underage assistants struggling with the large pots Vero buys to adorn her garden; the shadowy servants only ever partially in view. These people’s stories are filtered through windows, glass doors and water, keeping the primary focus firmly on María Onetto’s alluring, mysterious Vero.

Water is a conduit in _The Headless Woman_: it is bought to Vero by a kindly attendant as she weeps uncontrollably in the changing rooms; it transports the body of the disappeared boy down the canal. Rain doesn’t wash away Vero’s sin but rather confines her to wander as if suspended in a fish tank. The film charts her journey from a shock-induced zombie-like lethargy to a re-engagement with the people and places around her.

Martel constructs a society in denial. Only Lala, Vero’s elderly bedridden aunt, a character who might have been lifted from one of co-producer Pedro Almodóvar’s early features, recognises that something is amiss. ‘That voice doesn’t appear to be yours,’ she whispers ominously to Vero. This is a family haunted by the living dead: why are there children’s clothes in Vero’s house when her own daughters are supposedly grown up? What lies under Vero’s garden? Are the children’s prints on Vero’s car window those of her friends’ children or those of the child she may have killed? Martel provides no concrete answers. It’s the moral questions that resonate, repeatedly, through the film. _The Headless Woman_ underlines the multiple ways in which a society eschews social responsibility. Vero even avoids discussing the amorous advances of her feverish adolescent niece. No wonder the prophetic Lala asks, ‘Why does everyone in our family go crazy?’

While Martel has written that the film emerged from her own nightmares, the subject of ‘the disappeared’ remains a powerful trope in the New Argentine Cinema. Israel Adrián Caetano’s _Buenos Aires 1977_ (2006) and Lucía Cedrón’s _Lamb of God_ (2008) are just two of the many recent films to address it. Martel differs, however, in rooting her story  in an ostensibly contemporary world – the northwestern Salta landscape of her earlier films – that alludes only obliquely to the junta and its horrors. The 1970s infiltrates this world largely through the soundtrack, with a version of Nana Mouskouri’s ‘Soleil, Soleil’ and Julio Iglesias’ ‘Mammy Blue’ serving to position Vero and her family firmly within the ideology of the dictatorship. The grainy wedding footage Vero watches at Lala’s house includes _Saturday Night Fever_ dance routines that recall those recreated by Pablo Larraín in _Tony Manero_ (2008). As with Alfredo Castro’s deluded disco-dancing obsessive in Larraín’s feature, Vero reinvents herself anew – by dyeing her peroxide-blonde hair a warm brown.

_The Headless Woman_ may, on the surface, be the least accessible of Martel’s features, but it is ultimately the most enigmatic, accomplished and rewarding. Martel’s camera here appears as a further character, a mode of implicating the viewer within the unfolding trauma: a silent witness in the car with Vero; another member of the extended family at the social gatherings; a constant reminder of the absent ‘other’, the crime that no one will acknowledge. This elegant, disturbing film offers a commentary on contemporary Argentina as a ‘house full of ghosts’, and firmly undermines the conservative advice of one character: ‘If you don’t look at them, they just go away.’
