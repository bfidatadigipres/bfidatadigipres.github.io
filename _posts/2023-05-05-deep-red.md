**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away most of the plot.

In Argento’s filmography, _Deep Red_ comes between his early; densely plotted murder mysteries (_The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_, _Four Flies on Grey Velvet_) and his more recent exercises in supernaturally flavoured surrealism (_Suspiria_, _Inferno_). Not surprisingly, therefore, the film is a transitional work, featuring an intricate, cleverly constructed whodunit plot akin to the former, but made in the flamboyant, mosaic style of the latter. Alone among directors of Italian thrillers, Argento plays scrupulously fair by the audience in constructing his puzzles (a second viewing really does disclose a glimpse of the killer’s face during the first murder). But his literary precursors in the mystery field are not so much Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle as Fredric Brown and Cornell Woolrich. While the early films contain explicit borrowings from these authors (between them, _The Bird_ and _Four Flies_ use just about all of Brown’s _The Screaming Mimi_), _Deep Red_ stands on its own as a legitimate work in the tradition rather than just a pastiche of it.

The presence of David Hemmings as the obsessive artist/detective is a nod towards Antonioni, who is further represented by some serpentine camerawork and stately Roman locations. Marc’s teaming with Daria Nicolodi’s screwball newslady helps deflate the ponderousness of the reference, however, and signals a wry comedy amidst the gore that will blossom in the deliriously nonsensical Inferno. But even the comic relief dovetails with the plot: a very funny, and slightly disturbing, scene has Gianna rebuff Marc’s male chauvinism with a challenge to an arm-wrestling contest which, by cheating, she wins. Her victory underlines the possibility that a woman, although not necessarily this woman, could be the powerful hatchet killer; while Marc’s display of childishness at being bested ties in neatly with the infantile malice that characterises Olga, Carlo and the killer.

‘There is magic all around us’ remarks a character in _Suspiria_, aptly summing up the universe of Argento’s recent work. Rational detection does bring the mystery down to earth in _Deep Red_, but there are already signs of the irrationality which will engulf _Suspiria_ and _Inferno_. The plot is triggered off by the genuine insights of Macha Méril’s chic medium, who is seen reacting with horror moments before the axe-wielding murderer breaks down her door. Thereafter, Argento carries through the precognition theme by dwelling on apparently irrelevant details which foreshadow the various deaths: Marc is scalded by steam from a coffee machine before the authoress meets her fate in a boiling bath; the battering of a parapsychologist against a table is prefigured by Marc’s joking statement that he plays the piano because it represents a symbolic bashing-in of his father’s teeth; an overturned bus in the street relates to Carlo’s death under the wheels of two vehicles; and the removal of the chain from the gates to the house which harbours Martha’s secret is echoed by the linked necklace which takes off her head. With the introduction of Olga, the lizard-torturing pupil of a school which seems to have been turning out child psychos for over thirty years (‘Kill your mother and father’ reads a piece of washroom graffiti), the film edges nearer to the work of Mario Bava, Argento’s spiritual mentor. In fact, Nicoletta Elmi made her screen debut in Bava’s _Gli orrori del castello di Norimberga_/_Baron Blood_.

_Deep Red_ is nothing if not an elaborate mechanism, with the camera crawling among objets trouves like the _Incredible Shrinking Man_, teasing scare sequences involving broken dolls (the old paperbackmystery cover standby), a score by The Goblins that appropriately alternates between delicacy and bludgeoning, and a reference to Edward Hopper’s _Nighthawks_ long before _Pennies from Heaven_ and _Blade Runner_ made it fashionable. What sets Argento apart from imitators like Lucio Fulci is his combination of genuine pain (the murders are as nasty as one could wish, but the camera flinches where Fulci’s would linger) and self-mocking humour: among the toys and murder weapons on the killer’s floor are her lost marbles.  
**Kim Newman, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, November 1984**

For many of us, this is Argento’s masterpiece, the very pinnacle of his career. He would continue making good or even great films right through to _Opera_ in 1987 (after which the decline begins) but nothing would again quite scale the dizzy heights of _Profondo rosso_. Everything that Argento had been working towards in his first three horror films – _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_ (1970), _The Cat o’Nine Tails_ (1971) and _Four Flies on Grey Velvet_ (1971) – came to full fruition here.

In a variation on one of his favoured themes, it’s an Englishman abroad in this one, David Hemmings as jazz pianist Marcus Daly who is in Rome (though the film was shot in Turin because Argento had been told there were more practising Satanists there than in any other city) when psychic medium Helga Ulmann (Macha Méril) is killed following a demonstration interrupted by her detecting a terrible, murderous presence in the room. Like his predecessors, Daly is haunted by the idea that he’s seen something that holds the key to unlocking the mystery and begins a dogged investigation that leads him to a book titled _House of the Screaming Child_, a mysterious villa and a childhood trauma that comes to threaten both him and journalist Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi) who has joined him on his quest.

The story is standard issue Argento _giallo_, albeit with the first stirrings of the supernatural that would inform his two subsequent films. What really matters is the presentation. While the earlier films had all been visually stunning, nothing in them prepared us for _Profondo rosso_. There are few of the bravura camera moves that would become more commonplace in subsequent Argento films (think of the camera swooping down on Daniel as he crosses the plaza at night in _Suspiria_ (1977) or the camera crawling around the outside of the house in _Tenebre_ (1982)), but each shot is framed, composed and lit like a work of art. Argento occasionally indulges, as when his camera scurries across the pages of a music score, winds between abandoned toys in the flashbacks (notably alighting in one shot on the killer’s lost marbles…) or hovering over a piano keyboard. But the most memorable shots are the quieter ones, the less flashy and more meticulously crafted – the opening shots wherein a murder takes place entirely off camera but is later revealed to be the most important moment in the film; a silhouette at a glass door; Hemmings’ uncomprehending face reflected in a pool of blood in the final moments.

No film that Argento had made thus far – and few that would follow – looked as extraordinary as _Profondo rosso_. The violence is more pronounced, more confrontational, the crude acts of murder and sadism deliberately clashing with the more refined and gorgeously decorated sets in which they usually happen. His playful if macabre humour is in evidence again.

And then there’s the score. Music has always been a key element in a Dario Argento film, from the experimental, almost avant-garde jazz stylings of Ennio Morricone in the early films to the pounding heavy metal of later offerings. _Profondo rosso_ was originally set to be scored by jazz pianist Giorgio Gaslini but Argento was unhappy with the work he turned in. Having been rejected by British band Pink Floyd he turned his attention closer to home and contracted up and coming Italian prog rockers Goblin who contributed the bulk of the score (three Gaslini pieces made the final cut). It was the start of a long collaborative relationship between Argento and the various members of the band  (fallings out and ‘musical differences’ saw the band splinter with keyboard player Claudio Simonetti alternately going solo, leading the band Demonia and later fronting one of two different touring versions of Goblin). The score for _Profondo rosso_ is a full-on prog assault, a nagging main theme sitting alongside more frenetic aural assaults. The cacophonous racket of the band’s subsequent score for _Suspiria_ may be the more experimental and daring but the soundtrack to _Profondo rosso_ remains one of their most popular.

_Profondo rosso_ boasts both Argento’s warmest, most fully-rounded characters (Hemmings and Nicolodi are both particularly very good) but also his coldest, most sadistic killings to date. There’s a perverse poetry to the violence which is simultaneously unbearable to watch but impossible to take your eyes off. The plot plays fair with the viewer (the thing that Daly believes he’s seen while attempting to save Helga really is there – blink and you’ll miss it), is more intriguing than any that Argento had come up with before (he co-wrote it with Bernardino Zapponi) and it seems to have inspired him to up his already considerable game by a few extra notches.

Argento still had _Suspiria_, _Inferno_, _Tenebre_ and _Opera_ to come (_Phenomena_ is so insane it exists almost in a world all of its own) and they’re all brilliant films, every one a perfectly formed gem. But nothing would quite match the brilliance of _Profondo rosso_, the film where everything comes together to form the quintessential Argento film.
