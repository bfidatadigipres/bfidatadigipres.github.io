_+ intro and Q&A with Dishoom co-founder Shamil Thakrar, director  Sanvir Singh, history teacher Shalina Patel and film producer Ramneet Baidwan, moderated by Ashvin Devasundaram (Senior Lecturer, World Cinema, Queen Mary University)._

The untold story of Indian independence is seen through the décor of the Dishoom restaurant in Kings Cross, formerly a railway transit shed built in 1850. Dishoom co-founder Shamil Thakrar and history teacher Shalina Patel wander through the space after hours, discussing key figures and events, while the film illustrates this narration with a mixture of live action and animation.

Ashvin is Associate Director of the UK Asian Film Festival – London and has directed the UK Heritage Lottery-funded documentary _Movies, Memories, Magic_ (2018).

**Dialogues of Diaspora**  is a collaboration between London based writer/director **Sanvir Singh**  and LA based producer **Ramneet**  **Baidwan**.  The multidisciplinary creatives produce immersive films, podcasts and prints that hope to push the narrative and better represent the South Asian diaspora for a global audience.

They also care deeply about creating a company which is an awesome place to work.
