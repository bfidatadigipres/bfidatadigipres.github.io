_We are pleased to announce that the BFI’s Hires and Sales Manager  Jelena Milosavljevic, film critic Christina Newland and film journalist and  Editor-at-Large for Empire magazine Helen O’Hara will join season curator Ruby McGuigan onstage for this panel discussion._

Behind every group of emotionally stunted cowboys, aviators or detectives lies a wise-cracking woman. Or so it seems in the films of Howard Hawks, where we find some of early Hollywood’s boldest heroines. But what made a woman ‘Hawksian’, and why did she disappear? Join our panel as we dig into the trope, examine its legacy and question what it really means to be ‘one of  the boys’.

**About the panel**

**Jelena Milosavljevic** is an experienced film and event curator who has worked in film exhibition for over 10 years. Upon finishing her postgrad studies in film, she spent several years programming and working in film education before becoming Programme Director at the Phoenix Cinema. Jelena has worked at the BFI as Events Programmer, leading on contextual events for the public programme at BFI Southbank, and currently works as the BFI’s Hires and Sales Manager.

**Christina Newland** is the lead film critic at the _i_ newspaper and a journalist on film, pop culture, and boxing who has written for _VICE, Sight and Sound,_ the _BBC,_ _MUBI Notebook,_ and _Empire,_ among other publications. Her newsletter on women in in crime film and television, Sisters Under the Mink, won a UK Freelance Writing Award in 2021.

**Helen O’Hara** is an author, film journalist and Editor-at-Large for _Empire_ magazine, a publication she has worked with for almost 20 years. Originally from Northern Ireland, she qualified as a barrister before deciding not to be rich and instead to write about film for a living. She co-hosts the _Empire_ film podcast weekly and is a regular figure on the BBC and other TV and radio channels. Helen has written three books; the most recent is _Women vs Hollywood: The Fall and Rise of Women in Film_, a Radio 4 Book of the Week and _Sunday Times_ Film Book of the Year in 2021. She would like to be Hildy Johnson but fears she’ll never quite be able to carry off that hat.
