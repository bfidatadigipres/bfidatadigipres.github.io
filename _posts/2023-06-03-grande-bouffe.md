**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

If Marco Ferreri was among the greatest marginal Italian filmmakers, his marginality functioned on several levels. For one thing, his position within Italian cinema was necessarily peripheral, since so much of his work was shot in Spain, France and the US. For another, his political concerns inspired him to push against the boundaries of what could be shown on screen in a way that marked him out as a nonconformist even in a generation of auteurs that included Pier Paolo Pasolini and Bernardo Bertolucci. To paraphrase D.H. Lawrence, the Pasolini of _Salò_ was trying to be extreme; Ferreri just was extreme.

_Salò_ (1975) is almost certainly the title those encountering _La Grande Bouffe_ for the first time will be reminded of. Indeed, Ferreri’s film seems so obviously to have been conceived as a parody of Pasolini’s that it is difficult to believe it was actually made two years earlier. The plot involves four men who occupy positions of privilege within French society and who bear the first names of the actors (all Ferreri regulars) playing them – Marcello (Mastroianni), Ugo (Tognazzi), Michel (Piccoli) and Philippe (Noiret). As in _Salò_, these men retreat to a mansion, but there, rather than tormenting helpless innocents, they methodically commit suicide by overeating. Although their reason for doing this is never made clear (the plan itself only being revealed around the halfway point), it is obviously related to the same insight that motivated Gérard (Depardieu) to castrate himself at the end of Ferreri’s _La Dernière Femme_ (1976): the realisation that masculinity has been rendered redundant.

If Pasolini often focused on men resisting the institutions that restrained their sexual impulses, Ferreri was more interested in individuals who were the products of societies that had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist: his films frequently introduce their protagonists as solitary intruders in otherwise vacant landscapes, while _Bye Bye Monkey_ (1978) takes place in a New York patrolled by mysterious hazmat-suited figures and in danger of being taken over by rats. Ferreri’s work often has a post-apocalyptic feel, as if some unspecified catastrophe has taken place, leaving survivors with the task of finding new ways to live amid the actual and ideological debris of the past. And although the director claimed, in an interview for _Cahiers du cinéma_, that he did not understand women (‘I have a masculine vocabulary. I was formed, brought up, in a masculine culture’), it is usually women who prove most adept at meeting this challenge. Men, by contrast, insist on reproducing patterns of behaviour that, stripped of context, seem farcical, and in those films where society is still robust enough to exert a direct influence these unreconstructed males simply move to a space outside it: to an island in _Liza_ (1972), a Yugoslavian villa in _The Harem_ (1967), a house by the sea in _La Carne_ (1991) and the mansion in _La Grande Bouffe_.

There is, however, nothing rebellious about their exhibitions of aggressive masculinity. Ferreri’s ‘heroes’ are never more fully representative of the dominant ideology than when they believe themselves to be angrily rejecting it. If _La Grande Bouffe_’s four gourmands thumb their noses at bourgeois morality, they nonetheless subscribe to precisely the consumerist principles that once played an essential role in maintaining a functioning economy – and which, free of all externally imposed restrictions, can now be pursued to their logical conclusion. As responsible subjects under capitalism, we should, after all, be free to eat as much as we can afford to pay for, so why not keep eating until we expire?

The main female character, Andréa (Ferréol), who is sexually involved with all four men, suggests a healthier alternative to this death-orientated activity. When the final delivery of food arrives, she orders it to be strewn about the garden, an idea the delivery men respond to with incomprehension (‘It’s good meat!’) and contempt. Her insistence on having objects with a quantifiable value disposed of like so much rubbish is the one truly rebellious act in this film. Ferreri seems to have been fascinated by narratives in which four men become involved with a woman who rejects the notion of sexual exclusivity – but whereas _The Harem_’s Margherita (Carroll Baker) is ultimately destroyed by her lovers, _La Grande Bouffe_’s Andréa becomes the sole human survivor in an arena littered with male corpses, covered in the detritus of consumerism, and overrun by dogs.

Although the bulk of Ferreri’s oeuvre remains unknown in the UK, _La Grande Bouffe_ not only enjoyed British theatrical distribution (at least in the capital – it was awarded an X certificate by the Greater London Council after being banned by the BBFC) but has also been available for home viewing since the earliest days of VHS and Betamax; an English-dubbed transfer, taken from an astonishingly battered print, was released as a rental-only tape by Intervision in 1979 under the title  _Blow-Out_.  
**Brad Stevens, _Sight and Sound_, September 2015**

_La Grande Bouffe_ opens with introductions of its four principal characters in their home or work environments – a cocksure Mastroianni touching down at Orly, a dapper Tognazzi packing up his best German carving knives, a quietly trendy Piccoli loaning his apartment keys to his daughter in the unearthly TV company offices, a porcine Noiret roused from sleep by his matronly nanny (evidently the begetter of his bosom fetish) – in oblique, fragmentary scenes, where the emphasis on ‘random’ detail and low-key quirks of behaviour recalls Ferreri’s remarkable _Dillinger Is Dead_. But where the earlier film effectively dispensed with plot in its exploration of the Piccoli character through his possessions and obsessions,  _La Grande Bouffe_ studiously applies its observations to an elaborate narrative that verges perilously on allegory in its closing stages. Mastroianni’s playboy cool, for instance, with its attendant boyish pleasure in the vintage car, turns out to conceal intermittent impotence, suggested when he takes his first whore with the Bugatti manifold, and then calls the others ‘eunuchs’ after a tumultuous failure at mounting Andréa from the rear. And Piccoli’s ominous fastidiousness (he enthuses equally about the joys of rubber gloves and lemons as ‘nature’s own cleaner’) proves the harbinger of both his solitary ballet exercises and his progressive digestion problems, which achieve a bizarre synthesis at his death, farting volubly and floating almost weightlessly out on to a balcony.

In fact all the fetishes – cars, virility, breasts, mothers, _haute cuisine_ – look more and more like symptoms as the film proceeds, with the carefully assorted characters living out their society’s death-wish with growing self-consciousness. Ferreri at least allows them to begin in style, racing through their plates of oysters, savouring the touch of blasphemy in a lesbian pose on a _fin-de-siècle_ magic lantern slide, rising at cock-crow to continue the odyssey through the larder. Even then, though, he presents the inevitable indignities and vulgarities of their enterprise with decidedly unsympathetic detachment. At the abrupt onset of winter halfway through the film, his position petrifies into venomous contempt. The characters forget sensual pleasures and huddle together for subsistence warmth alone; the rooms that seemed splendidly ornate and exotic are suddenly dark and hostile as the characters no longer fill them. Noiret’s dogged devotion to Andréa is put through the mill as he watches his comrades take her one by one; ‘I’ll marry her anyway …’ he mutters to himself, ‘she does it out of goodness, not vice’. Even the food loses its transcendence once the gourmets start to squabble among themselves (‘Chestnut puree is one of my vices’ – ‘Then it’s a solitary vice, because I detest it’) and Tognazzi is reduced to creating great follies of dishes like the final mammoth pate in the form of a temple, which the survivors reject as tasteless.

This bleak vision of course echoes _Porcile_ in its abstraction of bourgeois mores into a kind of rarefied consumerism; but where Pasolini’s film carries the sting of an acknowledged complicity on the audience’s part, and of bourgeois caricatures who recognise their own Grosz-ness but know they will survive, Ferreri’s clear-cut narrative leads his characters all too directly to their (part consciously willed) end. This confident precision lends the film a simplistic, allegorical air, with only Earth Mother Andréa (in a suitably delicious performance by Andréa Ferréol) saving it from gratuitous nihilism. None the less, the film is never negligible thanks to Ferreri’s consistently inventive use of detail; and whatever else, it stands as an overdue riposte to the contemporary cinema’s ubiquitous hymns to male camaraderie.
