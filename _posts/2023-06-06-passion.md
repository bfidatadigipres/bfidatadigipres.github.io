If _Passion_ is about anything, it is about light. It’s about light in the pedantically literal sense that, for example, _Gandhi_ is about Gandhi – here, you might say, is a film about that shaft of light, that ‘bloody Tinkerbell’ which Attenborough famously refused to have stand in for his protagonist. Not only do its characters repeatedly refer to the light, either on a specialist or a casually conversational level – ‘La lumière ne va pas’, mutters Jerzy while setting up one of his tableaux (the phrase has been subtitled as ‘The lighting isn’t working’ where ‘The lighting isn’t right’ is what was meant); ‘Il n’y a pas de lumière’, says Hanna in the dark well of a staircase – but also sources of light in the form of film studio spotlights, table lamps, matches being struck, etc., are often visible on the screen. _Passion_’s own cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, comments off-screen on the significance of the single brightly lit figure in the first of the film’s tableaux – Rembrandt’s ‘The Night Watch’ – a figure who then obligingly absents herself from the composition for the purposes of his demonstration. In each sequence, practically in each shot, the lighting changes, from the watered-silk quiver of reflections on the surface of a studio tank to the dazzling play of sunlight and shadow on the snow to the merciless Photomat glare which highlights the flaws of Isabelle’s complexion.

A film about light is, by extension, a film about the cinema itself. In 1983, only a fool would attempt to contain a global definition of the cinema within one neat formula; and, as for defining beauty, there even fools have learned not to tread. Nevertheless… the medium’s chromosomal essence, its DNA, so to speak, must reside in the tension generated between what is filmed and what is not filmed. A camera describes a lateral pan, for instance, tracking the movement of a performer through an interior or exterior: that is what is filmed. As the pan proceeds, however, a number of visual units will necessarily ‘pan’ in the reverse direction, meeting, then being obscured by, then subsequently reappearing from behind the performer: that is what is not filmed, i.e., never wholly premeditated by the director. Though certain filmmakers (Fellini, Resnais, the Eisenstein of _Ivan the Terrible_) have endeavoured to obtain maximum control over the organisation of their visual material, the only instance of total domination that comes to mind is Murnau’s _Sunrise_.

Consider an early scene in which Janet Gaynor, having prepared a lunch box, waits under a tree for her husband George O’Brien, at that moment ploughing his little tract of land. The ox harnessed to the plough enters the frame diagonally from the lower right-hand corner. It advances just far enough for the preordained image to fall nicely into place… then comes to an abrupt halt. Had that ox advanced a fraction of an inch more, the composition would have gone askew – an almost parodic illustration of Murnau’s mania for perfection. _Sunrise_, a great film, is also a case apart. What the majority of (good) directors aim for is control, not over every zig and zag of the film’s discourse, but over the ultimate harmony (or harmonious discordance) of its diverse elements, of the filmed and the not-filmed. For this school, by far the more extensive, the supreme model would be _La Règle du jeu_, a work to which _Passion_ bears an odd resemblance.

In fact, Godard goes further than Renoir, to the point where it becomes virtually impossible to distinguish the filmed from the not-filmed. _Passion_ is an explosion – a diffraction, as one says of light – of filmic materiality (like the unmotivated explosion which ends _Zabriskie Point_), a multifarious dialectic of texture against texture, voices against lip movements, the lyric against the staccato, film against video, a film studio against a factory, love against work, naked flesh against rich, sickly fabrics, sound against image, narrative against non-narrative, light against darkness, light, indeed, against light.

Nothing is ever allowed its ‘proper’ _élan_. In a shot somehow both ridiculous and moving, a young woman jots down a room-service order, her torso bent back on itself like a contortionist’s or like a nutcracker. Michel Piccoli is burdened with a racking cough, one which appears to be caused by the rose permanently dangling from his lips like a Gitane Bleu. Isabelle Huppert stutters. The camera stutters, too, in the film’s opening shot, a glittering skyscape bisected by the straight-as-an-arrow, fluffy white wake of a jet, an exquisite shot ‘marred’ by some disturbingly jerky camera movements. Yet, elsewhere, there are intimations of a classical, nostalgic, marbly perfection: in the tableaux (even though Jerzy is never satisfied with the way they are lit); in the music (Ravel, Fauré, Mozart, Beethoven and Dvorák); and in the Ingresque curves of nude extras (mostly feminine, but with one becurled cherub).

Which leads to the second definition. What, the critic brashly enquires, is beauty? Perfection with faults? In painting (except for the readymades of Schwitters or Robert Rauschenberg), everything is painted. In music (except for a few recent aleatoric pieces), everything is composed. In literature (except for the automatic writings of the Surrealists and the cut-up processes of William Burroughs and co.), everything is written. Only in film, a modern art by definition, does the premeditated co-exist innately with the unpremeditated; and if Jerzy’s tableaux are beautiful in themselves, it’s precisely because they remain flawed, imperfect – in a word, _vivants_. Godard wrestles with the angel of perfection (as does Jerzy, quite literally, with a recalcitrant angel in one of the Delacroix tableaux), knowing full well that he cannot win, knowing equally that in his defeat lies the salvation of his film. _Passion_ is a masterpiece.
