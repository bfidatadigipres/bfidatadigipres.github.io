_+ Q&A with writer/creator Charlie Brooker, actor Josh Hartnett, executive producer Jessica Rhoades and director John Crowley._

**Writer/Creator Charlie Brooker on ‘Beyond the Sea’**

_Tell us about the concepts behind ‘Beyond the Sea’._

_Beyond the Sea_ is set in a fictionalised 1969. We encounter two astronauts, David and Cliff, played by Aaron Paul and Josh Hartnett. They are on board a spaceship that’s undergoing a lengthy mission. And there’s a very ‘Black Mirror’ bit of tech at work that’s central to their mission – and that’s all I’m going to say about that for now! When I’d first envisaged this, it was set in the near future – but in keeping with shaking things up this season I thought ‘fuck it, what if it’s set in the 60s instead’.  And then doing that immediately gave it a slightly different tone, and also informed the characters – because they have the mindset and attitudes of people from that era. Alongside that, this episode has a classic sci-fi feel with a dreamlike quality.

One of our producers said to me, ‘This is your pandemic episode’. I stopped and thought about it, and it kind of is. But not in the way you might think. The story does deal with isolation, loneliness, and confinement, all things we felt during the pandemic. Something about the premise is very straightforward but it’s also a real actor’s piece and needed a strong cast which we were very lucky to have.

_Tell us about the cast of ‘Beyond the Sea’_.

We’ve been very lucky with _Black Mirror_ across all the seasons, but we have a very strong cast this season. Aaron Paul was great as Cliff, as was Josh Hartnett. Aaron Paul had the tough job of playing both characters simultaneously, and he had to wrestle with some grim material. We were filming in a heatwave, and I have no idea how he stayed sane. Josh Hartnett captured the golden boy nature of his character mixed with vulnerability. Both did an astonishing job. Then there was Kate Mara, who was amazing. Her performance is heartbreaking. Honestly, I am in awe of all their performances.

_Can you talk to us about your thoughts on ‘Beyond the Sea’?_

_Beyond the Sea_ is the episode of the season that most comments on the last several years that we’ve all experienced in the wake of the pandemic. It takes a hard look at how we communicate and connect remotely with one another in an unexpected way.

Aaron Paul really is astounding in his role. We wanted him back after his small cameo in ‘USS Callister’. At the time of casting, he had just had his second child, so we were concerned it wasn’t going to work out. We sent him the script, and he fell in love with it. The thing about Aaron is, aside from being an incredible actor, his ability in finding the most amazing ways to connect the character and then the scene.

Then with Josh, we get to see a different side of how viewers have typically experienced his work. With this episode, he gets to explore a leading man charm, which audiences have seen before, but then things take a twist in a way that I don’t think will be expected.

_What was the greatest challenge for ‘Beyond the Sea”?_

The creation of the space shuttle was complex. We had to take into consideration how these two men were living in the spaceship, in this confined shared space.  It really was a collaborative process between Charlie Brooker, our director John Crowley, and our production designer Udo Kramer. We wanted to lean into preconceptions that viewers have of spaceships of the era, even though this is a fictionalised alternative 1960s, but give them something they hadn’t seen before.
