Before even the credit titles can appear, Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell arrive to a blast of music at screen centre from behind a black curtain, in matching orange-red outfits that sizzle the screen covered with spangles, topped with feathers to look at one another, toss white ermines towards the camera and out of frame and sing robustly in unison. As electrifying as the opening of any Hollywood movie that comes to mind, this jazzy materialisation so catches us by surprise that we are scarcely aware of the scene’s fleeting modulations as the dynamic duo makes it through a single chorus. The black curtain changes to a lurid blue, then a loud purple; the two women twice exchange their positions on stage while gradually dancing down a few steps; and the complex flurry of gestures they make towards each other – all gracefully dovetailed into Jack Cole’s deft choreography – makes the spectator feel assaulted by them as a team as well as individually: a double threat.

This opening to _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ is just the first in a series of rude shocks. The second comes only moments later – after the credits have appeared over the same stage curtain and an off-screen choral version of ‘Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend’ (in a passage of relative respite, during which we’re shuttled through no less than seven more garish colour changes) when, after ‘Little Rock’ resumes, the film cuts from Monroe singing solo to a reverse angle of a tuxedo-clad Tommy Noonan watching, waving and wanly blowing a kiss from a cabaret table. The lumpy, passive, decisively unheroic presence of Noonan in the shot – as the film viewer’s uninvited surrogate, as a neuter/neutral surface off which the dynamism of Monroe is allowed to ricochet creates a dialectical montage of collision, like lightning striking a plateful of mush, as jolting in its way as the first apparition of Monroe and Russell.

Henceforth, all Howard Hawks’ cards are on the table. The viewer is warned that the unbridled spectacle of his two female stars and the flabby repose of male reaction shots comprise the dialectical limits of this film’s cartoon universe, and the only equals to be seen anywhere will be the two stars themselves. Indeed, in a world where competition and corruption are taken for granted, their non-competitive friendship forms a united front which is the film’s only moral centre.

If we pause, finally, to consider the words of their song, the notion of spiritual kinship becomes even more striking when we realise that they’re assuming precisely the same identity. They begin as ‘two little girls from Little Rock’ who ‘lived on the wrong side of the tracks.’ But after Monroe takes over to describe how, after ‘someone’ broke her heart in Little Rock and she ‘up and left the pieces there,’ she eventually drifted to New York with a more hardened view of men and what she wanted from them, Russell promptly becomes the ‘I’ in the same narrative: ‘Now one of these days in my fancy clothes/I’m going back home to punch the nose,’ before they end in unison, ‘Of the one who broke my heart ... in Little Rock.’

In effect, though neither Lorelei Lee (Monroe) nor Dorothy Shaw (Russell) has yet been introduced as a character, the movie is already offering both as Lorelei the gold digger. If we check back to Anita Loos’ 1925 flapper novel which provided the original source material, written in the form of Lorelei’s diary, we discover that she’s the only one who comes from Little Rock, and her departure is precipitated specifically by shooting an unfaithful lover. Yet with a magical transmutation made possible by musicals, the movie Lorelei is accorded not only a softer centre but a spiritual essence multiplied by two, and distributed equally to Dorothy.

Hawks is famous as the director who never once deigned to film a flashback, and the pasts with which he furnishes his characters before their screen appearances are generally scanty. Sometimes this involves an unhappy love affair, as in _Only Angels Have Wings_ and _Rio Bravo_; here it is dispensed with as quickly as possible, vaguely to motivate Lorelei’s gold-digging, and then just as quickly dropped so that the rest of the movie can bask in the immanence of a continuous present tense. The thing to stress is that the absence of any narrative discontinuity between song and story makes the numbers a form of being for both characters rather than a form of acting; and within this being, Dorothy is quite willing to assume or share Lorelei’s identity, without warning, explanation or regret.

While Hawks’ only pure musical might conceivably be the most popular of his movies today, critics on the whole tend to be confounded by it. Treated only marginally in books devoted to the director, it has received attention more recently from feminist writers, who often disagree about essential characteristics. For Maureen Turin (‘Gentlemen Consume Blondes’, _Wide Angle_, No 1), it is sexist, racist and colonialist; for Lucie Arbuthnot and Gail Seneca (‘Text and Pre-Text: _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_’, _Film Reader_, No 5), it is jubilantly feminist and, at least by implication, proto-lesbian. Molly Haskell (‘Howard Hawks’ in _Cinema: A Critical Dictionary_), no less persuasively, finds it ‘as close to satire as Hawks’ films ever get on the nature (and perversion) of sexual relations in America, particularly in the mammary-mad 50s.’

Like the blind men grasping different parts of the elephant, each of these writers is on to something – which helps to explain why the movie manages to accommodate some of the viewpoints and fantasies of heterosexuals and homosexuals of both genders. If doubts remain (as with Robin Wood, Gerald Mast, Leland Pogue and Donald Willis in their Hawks books), these mainly have to do with the lacklustre male leads, Noonan and Elliott Reid. But Richard Dyer in _Stars_ goes further and, in judicious detail, finds incoherence at the very heart of the film, in the figure of Lorelei as played by Monroe: ‘a quite massive disjunction’ between the innocence of Monroe’s image and the calculation of Lorelei’s character. ‘This is not a question of Lorelei/Monroe being one thing one moment and another the next, but of her being simultaneously polar opposites.’

In so far as Lorelei/Monroe is perceived as an isolated character, Dyer’s point is irrefutable. But seen as an integral function in a diabolical machine that also incorporates Russell, Noonan and Reid, she projects a coherence and legibility that is as sharply defined as theirs. In fact, the movie’s innate capacity to suggest readability and unreadability, feminism and sexism, optimism and pessimism, beauty and grotesquerie at one and the same time makes it the ideal capitalist product, malleable to every consumer need: a distillation of Hollywood which is also a parody of same, a calculated/innocent excess of effect which rewards characters and spectators equally so that everybody gets what they think they want.

Central to the achievement of _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ is the extraordinary rapport between Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe, which constantly enhances the interaction between Dorothy and Lorelei. This notion of documentary imposed over fiction is related to Hawks’ flair for instilling a relaxed atmosphere on his sets.

It is worth noting, therefore, that Monroe and Russell actually became friends while working on _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ – despite the fact that Russell was paid $200,000 for her part (and got top billing), while Monroe, on her Fox salary and not yet a star, got only $500 a week. Hawks once explained their unusual ‘chemistry’ as screen presences by describing Monroe as a fantasy and Russell as ‘real’.<br>
