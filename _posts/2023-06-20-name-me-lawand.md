_+ discussion with director Edward Lovelace; Steve Crump OBE, founder and chair of Deaf Kidz International; and Sophie Stone, deaf artist, activist and support teacher. Hosted by Stuart Brown, BFI Head of Programme and Acquisitions._

Convinced of the potential of their deaf son, a Kurdish family leave Iraq and finally arrive in Derby, where Lawand joins the Royal School for the Deaf Derby. Empowered with British Sign Language, he reveals himself as a witty and popular student, while his family navigate a new common language and fight to remain in the community that has embraced them. Director Edward Lovelace (_The Possibilities Are Endless_) spent years alongside Lawand and his family, to produce this striking, affecting portrait. On World Refugee Day we are proud to present this powerful documentary, highlighting the importance of community and the transformative effect of finding your voice.  

**Director's statement**  
_Name Me Lawand_ is a story about the power that language gives us, the freedom that a real home allows us, and the burning light of hope that never goes out.

This is a film that feels, instead of tells. It constantly searches, at first unknowingly, for a sense of understanding. Its audience is asked to experience Lawand’s journey just as he did.

Fear initially turns into truth, friendship and connection. As it becomes clearer in Lawand’s mind who he is, and what the world around him feels like, we too begin to understand.

Lawand is someone who for most of his life has had other people speak for him, represent him. This has been his greatest frustration, desperately wanting to communicate to the world who he is, in his own way. For Lawand it is simple – when he communicates in British Sign Language, he is the real Lawand.

The film’s goal is to show the world what can happen when someone is given the freedom to express themselves in their language of choice, in a place they feel they can be celebrated as their true self.

I discovered Lawand and his brother through a photo taken by a photographer who had visited the family when they first arrived in Derby. On learning more about their story, I visited his school and met him and his family early in 2019. Then, we didn’t have a shared language, but we quickly bonded as I learnt British Sign Language and we started to build our film team – with a Kurdish and a deaf producer.

I wanted to build trust and a strong foundation, so I spent most of 2019 being present at Lawand’s school (The Royal School for the Deaf Derby), talking to teachers and forging bonds. They saw that I felt inspired just to exist there.

Our connection with the family has also been something we have been so proud of. We have assisted them on their visits to court and helped in various ways in their Home Office case. Possibly, the most notable moment was a segment from the film showcasing Lawand’s fluency in British Sign Language which became a pivotal moment in the Home Office’s understanding of the importance of this language to Lawand.

To become a part of Lawand's journey, however small, is one of my proudest achievements. I want the film to celebrate the light that shines from Lawand.
