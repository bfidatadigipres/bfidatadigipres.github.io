The success of _La Belle Noiseuse_ makes it plausible that audiences see in it a qualified but nonetheless comforting reaffirmation of the values not only of Art, but also of European art cinema. Indeed, perhaps Rivette (until now mostly an enigmatic outsider even in his own country) wanted to try his hand at the genre better known from Eric Rohmer: _La Belle Noiseuse_ could well be one of those _contes moraux_ which have become Rohmer’s trademark. Rivette’s tight plotting, the film’s many formal symmetries and neat ironies, the division into clearly felt scenes and acts, the respect for the unities of French classical drama all recall Rohmer, both theme and setting making one think of _La Collectionneuse_ (1966) or Rohmer’s homage to Matisse, _Pauline à la plage_ (1982). The opening of _La Belle Noiseuse_, with the young couple pretending to be strangers who succumb to lust at first sight in order to shock two dowdy tourists from England is pure Rohmer, if it wasn’t also vintage Rivette (comparable to the opening of _L’Amour par terre_, 1984, where a solemn group of men and women are led through backstreets and courtyards up several flights of stairs into a Paris apartment to become eavesdropping witnesses to the infidelities and domestic complications of an executive with a wife and a mistress, before the spectator realises that these are down-at-heel actors who have invented not street theatre, but apartment theatre).

To be familiar with other Rivette films certainly helps to make sense not only of this opening. If there are still any auteurists out there, here is a chance to practise the old skills of recognising personal themes and formal obsessions, of spotting allusions and putting together the cross-references and inter-texts: in other words, precisely, to salute the artist and his inimitable signature. What in the earlier films had been the structuring principle – namely to use the theatre, a performance to be rehearsed, a show to be put on, in the course of which the characters find out some, inevitably painful, truth about themselves – is here the function of the painting, in each case setting off art versus life, the classical against the vagaries of personal relations, formal anger against the anarchies of _l’amour fou_ and the destructiveness of self-obsession.  
**Thomas Elsaesser, _Sight and Sound_, April 1992**

Not merely an exciting return to form, but also something of a personal testament, Rivette’s masterpiece, a very free adaptation of Balzac’s _Le Chef d’oeuvre inconnu_, can be read in part as an apologia for the narrative cautiousness that his work has shown since the dangerous experimentation of his richest period (roughly, from _L’Amour fou_ in 1968 to _Noroît_ in 1976). For all the distinction of most of his subsequent work, a backing away from the theme of madness – explicit in _L’Amour fou_ and _Out 1_, rationalised in _Céline et Julie vont en bateau_, internalised in _Duelle_ and _Noroît_ – has placed most of his work since _Merry-go-round_ at a lower risk level. Since _Out_, moreover, one can chart a nearly parallel retreat from the contemporary world: if the Balzac reference in _Out_ offered an ironic 19th-century perspective on 60s counterculture, the Balzac reference in _La Belle Noiseuse_ establishes that Rivette has fully adopted this perspective as his own.

Ultimately opting for life over art – for saving his marriage rather than plunging into the void opened up by his painful masterpiece – Frenhofer, powerfully embodied by Michel Piccoli in the performance of his career, seems to be making a comparable choice. If _La Belle Noiseuse_ suggests at times a remake of _L’Amour fou_, with Frenhofer’s sketches and brush strokes and Marianne’s alternating bouts of compliance and rebellion taking the place of the earlier film’s theatre rehearsals, certain concerns remain constant: the material processes of work (including its duration and rhythms) and its profoundly collaborative nature. What seems new is an ironic perception of the art market (as embodied by Porbus) and a somewhat sadder but wiser perception of the perils that risky art-making entails.

It is both satisfying and just that the first commercial hit of Rivette’s career should be four hours long. Despite much moaning over the years from critics about his running times – complaints which have indeed played a part in obliging him to make shorter films – the fact remains that, with very few exceptions, the longer his films run, the more disciplined and purposeful they turn out to be. As it happens, Rivette has also edited a two-hour version of  _La Belle Noiseuse_ for French TV using completely different takes, but it’s no surprise to hear that he himself judges it inferior: in the three other cases where he has edited shorter versions of his films – _L’Amour fou_, _Out 1_, _L’Amour par terre_ – the superiority of the longer version is irrefutable.

Duration and process are central to Rivette’s concerns, and the viewer’s changing perception of Emmanuelle Béart’s nude body from pure erotic object to painterly material over the course of four hours is fundamentally linked to the mysterious changes undergone by all the major characters – changes occurring both in terms of the plot and in terms of the spectator’s shifting relationship to the action. This isn’t, moreover, an issue that can be reduced to long versus short takes: Rivette’s jump cuts and other elisions are as central to his strategies as his use of real time.

The film’s key scene features neither nudity nor painting but a confrontational dialogue between Liz and Frenhofer in their adjoining bedrooms and on a connecting terrace. Interestingly, this terrace recalls the ramparts where life-and-death struggles are waged in _Noroît_, and Rivette’s musical sense of _mise-en-scène_ has never been more masterful in charting both the literal movements of a couple and the ‘stations’ of their passion (in both the carnal and Christian senses).

Bracketing his tale with bantering dialogues and social poses that suggest Marivaux, Rivette seems more conscious than ever of art as a treacherous house of fiction planted within a wider world, in this case, a sensual rural setting that is beautifully captured in sound and image. The fact that we never catch more than a glimpse of Frenhofer’s ‘real’ finished masterpiece – a flash of bloody red in the lower section – suggests both the mysteries and the terrors that the remainder of the film outlines, negotiates, and desperately contains.
