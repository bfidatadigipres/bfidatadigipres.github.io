_+ intro and discussion_

In this loose adaptation of Michel Faber’s acclaimed 2000 novel, Scarlett Johansson’s character expropriates the body of a young woman and prowls Scotland’s winding back roads and city streets in search of fresh meat. Shooting on location, director Jonathan Glazer invites the audience to watch from the outsider’s perspective and relate to their struggle to comprehend a foreign people in a foreign land.
This short series is curated by Benjamin Brown and presented in partnership with Citizen Autistic – The London Autism Film Club.

**RELAXED SERIES: GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE**  

‘The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.’ –Henri Bergson

The yawning Grand Canyon, chasms between perception versus reality, the complex, fluid nature of gender and identity and the Siren-like seductiveness of modern technology are among the themes and topics explored in this two-film pairing running in May and June.

From the mind-bending concept of ‘Simulation Theory’, the notion that reality is just a product of astronomically advanced computer programmes probed in the documentary _A Glitch in the Matrix_, to the alien gaze of Scarlett Johansson’s curious cosmic interloper in the sensual sci-fi _Under the Skin_, these films each present divergent viewpoints and ways of thinking.

In today’s hyper-connected world of runaway artificial intelligence and immersive, utterly convincing virtual realms, the series also begs viewers to ponder one key question: what does it mean to be human anyway?

After each screening join us for a relaxed discussion as we explore some of these themes. Benjamin Brown will host the discussion. This month it will be in the BFI Reuben Library.
