When Allen encounters Madison, he thinks he’s finally met the girl of his dreams. Unbeknown to him, she is actually a mermaid and, while the romantic feelings are mutual, there’s an ocean of issues to address if they have a chance of making their relationship work. The first film from Touchstone, _Splash_ was a hit with critics and audiences alike, thanks to a smart script, the chemistry of rising stars Darryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, and a Ron Howard’s seamless direction.

**A contemporary review**  
Financed not by Disney Studios but by Buena Vista, their distribution set-up, _Splash_ finds itself free to quote from _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ on one of the television sets with which Madison becomes fascinated, and to have Allen express his inner feelings as romance blossoms with an a cappella rendition of ‘Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah’. However, since Uncle Walt is nowhere invoked on the credits by name, the film is also able to sidestep the coyness that restricted the aquatic activities of Ann Blyth in _Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid_ and Glynis Johns in _Miranda_, allowing the splendid Daryl Hannah to be innocently, tastefully naked, in and out of the water, before she succumbs to the human joys of Bloomingdales and Allen’s credit card. Like _Something Wicked This Way Comes_ and _Never Cry Wolf_, _Splash_ is a typically Disney subject trying to be grown up. But while Jack Clayton’s magical Americana and Carroll Ballard’s True Life Adventure interpret adulthood as a need to make solemn pronouncements, Ron Howard’s updating of certain sit-com fantasies is far more relaxed and mature, constructed (like his equally amiable _Night Shift_) not as a _hommage_ to a bygone genre but as a contemporary addition to it. The opposition of the hero’s hectic, everyday world and the heroine’s serene dreamland is a sophisticated development of the obviousness of _Brigadoon_, made workable by Howard’s fine comic sense in the topside scenes, and the elegant realisation of a clearwater marine paradise (with Bahaman seas standing in for Cape Cod and New York harbour) as Madison frolics among the corals and takes refuge in a sunken galleon whose charts usefully guide her to New York.

The attempts at physical comedy (Kornbluth’s Clouseau-like efforts to wet Madison down; the final chase) do not match the script’s wide-ranging verbal wit. But Hannah and Tom Hanks make the potentially slippery human/non-human love affair the most convincing and touching since the heyday of _I Married a Witch_ and _The Ghost and Mrs. Muir_. Having learnt the director’s trade on New World car-action films (_Grand Theft Auto_) and made-for-TV movies (_Cotton Candy_), Howard, the likeable teenage straight man from _American Graffiti_ and _Happy Days_, has now made the most interesting actor-to-director career move since Clint Eastwood began obsessively re-examining his own screen image. In a period when comedy in the cinema is equated with getting laid and food fights, Howard stands for off-beat ideas, oddball characters, snappy dialogue, comedians who genuinely get involved in their roles (Hannah abandoned her own screen treatment of _The Little Mermaid_ to play the part), and a childlike but not childish enchantment that puts _E.T._ to shame. While Disney’s recent highly touted attempts to break the company’s kiddie image have failed to recoup their overly generous budgets, _Splash_ –which would certainly have met with the approval of the man whose topless mermaids and nymphs had their nipples air-brushed out of _Fantasia_ – has become the studio’s biggest hit in fifteen years.
