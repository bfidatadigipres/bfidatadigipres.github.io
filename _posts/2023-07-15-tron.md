**A contemporary review**  
The much-publicised gimmick that sets _Tron_ apart in the current science-fiction wave is that much of its geography and hardware was created by computer and, unlike the miniatures of _Star Wars_ or the elaborate sets for _Alien_, required no physical existence whatever for filming purposes. One suspects that the film’s appearance actually results from a remarkable combination of animated skills intended to _look_ as though it was all done by computer, but even in today’s computer-conscious milieu (where every schoolchild seems unnervingly fluent in Basic), the average spectator is unlikely to spot the joins. With constructs and vehicles by Syd Mead (_Blade Runner_), costumes and armour by Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud (of _Heavy Metal_ magazine), matte paintings by Harrison Ellenshaw (of _The Black Hole_ and _The Empire Strikes Back_), and Lisberger’s own design abilities (as established in _Animalympics_), the visual possibilities of an electronic micro-society are fascinatingly suggested, and it seems irrelevant to question whether the intricate luminous strips on the uniforms were added later or whether the face of the evil MCP was faked up by anything other than standard Disney futurism. With its merciless, angular geometry, its unbounded arena of competition, and its savage, simple code of destruction, the world of _Tron_ enjoyably echoes the habitual massacres of the video ritual.

One might still complain that it promises rather more than it delivers. While nobody would require complexities of characterisation from a video game, and the film duly delivers amiably uninteresting humanoids in a conventional good-versus-bad predicament, the bleak, featureless game grid quickly sets a tone more of parsimony than simplicity. The inventive barrage of assailants that forms a deafening part of any video struggle is limited in _Tron_ to a few tanks and floating giant claws. The film’s happiest encounter is with the racing light-cycles, hurtling across the infinite grid leaving walls of colour as they go; the scene is superbly shot and orchestrated, and nothing afterwards can quite match it for excitement. There are glimpses of what appears to be the computer’s up-market area with some exotic costumes, and of delightful but unexplained green insects. There’s even a pretty but not particularly meaningful transformation scene as the MCP’s ‘curse’ is lifted. The David-and-Goliath stuff of the finale is good, macabre melodrama (a jolly touch is the wound that ‘bleeds’ nuts and bolts and circuitry), but the outcome has great inevitability ­– it’s no novelty to see David Warner demolished – and the clean-cut Bruce Boxleitner makes a startlingly antiseptic winner.

For those who would have favoured less spectacle and more substance, the saving grace of _Tron_ is its humour. Lisberger’s script carries a mocking edge that trims away most of the pretensions and just leaves the fun, dulled occasionally by the cast’s heavyweight delivery. A nod to _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ goes cheerfully by, there is a pleasing moment as munching Pac-Men appear on the villain’s battle chart, and the use of standard computer imagery provides some splendid menace and invective. ‘You worn-out excuse for an old programme!’ snarls Sark at one of his victims, only to be reduced in turn to quaking terror when the Master Control suggests icily that he might prefer to work in a pocket calculator. Almost thrown away to avoid overemphasis is the philosophy of the video-game participants, who are kept on the go at the whim of the Users who programme them: ‘You just keep doing what it looks like you’re supposed to be doing’. And that’s how it is for the Users too, of course. With his closing shot, Lisberger gives us a magnificent panorama of the real city, a gigantic grid on which we can see ourselves, should we feel so inclined, as Units engaged in our own hectic confrontations, hoping that somebody somewhere is pushing the right buttons.
