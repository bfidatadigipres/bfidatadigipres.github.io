**NB: The short** **_BURN-E_**  **will screen after the feature.**

In the future, Earth has been evacuated and rubbish-collecting robots prepare the planet for the return of humankind. With the passage of time, the robots become obsolete, save for energetic but lonely WALL-E, who may just hold the answer to the future of the planet. With a near-silent first section that was compared favourably to the best of Chaplin, this unique, eco-minded Pixar animation warns of prioritising technology over humanity.  
**bfi.org.uk**

Near the end of Pixar film _Ratatouille_, a joyless food critic is spiritually revived by the titular peasant dish. Humbly, he declares to the world that the only thing critics are good for is ‘discovering and defending the new.’ The speech, delivered in Peter O’Toole’s rich tones, smacked of a cartoon studio simultaneously trumpeting its artistic worth and blowing a raspberry at reviewers who underrated its work.

It’s tempting, then, to be sceptical about Pixar’s ninth CGI film _WALL-E_, a future-set saga about the romantic-heroic adventures of a little-guy robot, left to clear up a litter-covered Earth long after all the humans have gone. On the one hand, the film has been sold to us as ‘R2-D2 The Movie’, though the robot’s gormlessly cute appearance is more reminiscent of Johnny Five, the mawkish hero of the 1980s _Short Circuit_ films. Indeed, the eponymous WALL-E recalls both droids, as well as E.T. and the toasters-on-legs of _Silent Running_ (1972). His curiosity about the discarded items people have left behind also qualifies him as an honorary Womble.

At the same time the pre-publicity warned that _WALL-E_ is a ‘risky’ Pixar film, with little or no dialogue (actually, it has more than we might have expected, and even the empty world where the first act is set is rarely silent). But with so much about _WALL-E_ presold before we even enter the cinema, it seems a bit much to expect reviewers to champion a film backed by a lucrative Hollywood brand.

Annoyingly, _WALL-E_ – from _Finding Nemo_ director Andrew Stanton, who previously had a less auteurist cachet than _Ratatouille_’s Brad Bird – is exceptionally good. In fact it’s one of Pixar’s best films, ranking alongside _Toy Story 2_ (1999) and _The Incredibles_ (2004). Moreover, it indeed feels ‘new’, moving out of Pixar’s comfort zone while retaining the brand’s populist virtues: loveable characters, crafted jokes, aw-shucks niceness and wonderful images.

As the film unfolds, it seems that this story can’t work in animation, much as people felt Disney’s debut cartoon feature _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ couldn’t work in 1937. At first it appears too humourlessly photoreal, too like the live-action ‘empty worlds’ in films such as _I Am Legend_ (2007). Then _WALL-E_ seems destined to shunt itself into one-note repetitions of a theme, such as the robot’s cute antics in his planet-sized playground or his pratfalling efforts to woo EVE, the white egg-shaped probe (inspired by the sleek lines of iPods) who descends from the sky.

The film’s joy, though, is the way _WALL-E_’s situation develops in an organic, lyrical, musical way. The rhythms recall Disney’s _Bambi_ (1942), while the audiovisual world – as Stanton acknowledges – is extrapolated from the opening of _Star Wars_ (1977), where a nervously beeping R2-D2 trundle through a strange world of childlike anthropomorphic beings, many of them robotic, who whine and whirr and squeal. The vocalisations in _WALL-E_ are by the same feted sound designer, Ben Burtt, and they’re suitably winsome and winning.

But it’s the appearance of the robots – a male square, a female circle – that the viewer remembers. The pairing of the clunky _WALL-E_ and the pristine EVE recalls Buzz and Woody in _Toy Story_, and in the second half of the film there is a lot of chasing around in futuristic interiors à la _Monsters, Inc._ (2001). The robot protagonists’ limited artificial expressions recall _Cars_ (2006), but without the _Tootles the Taxi_ associations. As in _Cars_, some of the most lyrical scenes convey the joys of being a supple piece of metal in motion (one joyous space flight matches anything in Miyazaki Hayao’s animation). Conversely, there’s a surprisingly dark interlude where WALL-E obsessively cares for EVE when she’s shut down and effectively ‘dead’, with disturbingly funny overtones of Norman Bates.

True, _WALL-E_’s adventures in the cartoon form were anticipated in independent animations, such as Sylvain Chomet’s mostly wordless _Belleville_ _Rendez-Vous_ (2003). Bu t _WALL-E_ sets firsts in taking the commercial Hollywood cartoon into new and unexpected places while insisting – as Disney did – on innocent, cute, loveable stars. For all its 2001 jokes and SF plotting, the film’s heart is in its beeping babes in the wood. Between them, they make an old brand invigoratingly new.
