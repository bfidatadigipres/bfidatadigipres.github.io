**Greta Gerwig on ‘Barbie’**

_On making_ Barbie...

Barbie has so much recognition, so much love, and of course a 60-plus-year history, which was exciting for me. As a writer and a director, I’m always looking for a fun challenge. As with _Little Women_, _Barbie_ is a property we all know, but to me she felt like a character with a story to tell, one that I could find a new, unexpected way into, honouring her legacy while making her world feel fresh and alive and modern.

_On understanding Barbie…_

The idea of the multiplicity of the Barbies and then the Kens really did come out of my first meeting with Mattel, when I started talking about different characters and they said, ‘No, we don’t have different characters. All of these women are Barbie.’ And I replied that if all of these women are Barbie then Barbie is all of these women, and they said, ‘Yes.’

_On Barbie’s past…_

I grew up with Barbie, but I was always waiting for our neighbours’ children to grow tired of theirs so they would give me the hand-me-down Barbies. That was the big thing I was always looking forward to. I have a very vivid, visceral memory of Barbie and what it meant.

_On Margot Robbie as a producer…_

_Barbie_ came to me through Margot Robbie. Margot was the one who had gotten the rights, had brought it to Warner Bros., had sort of spearheaded this whole project, and we had met, and I was a big fan of hers as an actress. But then when we talked, I realised what an incredible producer she was. She was super smart and extremely involved and really interesting.

_On Margot Robbie as Barbie…_

Margot is our Stereotypical Barbie, as she says in the film, ‘I'm the Barbie everyone thinks of when you think of Barbie.’ And when you think of the most beautiful, cheerful, friendly, blonde lady you’ve ever seen, that's Margot. But the thing I wanted to do most of all was to allow her to be outrageously funny. She’s the person you're going to go on a real journey with in the movie and because she's always able to make things grounded, relatable, and very emotional even when it’s ridiculously heightened and funny, you never feel like you lose the humanity.

_On Ryan Gosling…_

We wrote this part specifically for Ryan Gosling. Even though he’s so wonderful in dramatic roles, I knew he was really funny as I had watched all his _Saturday Night Live_ appearances. There was no plan B. It was always Ryan.

_On pink…_

First and foremost, I wanted Barbie Land to feel like a happy place – where Barbie lives in our childhood imaginations. One of the first days I met with [production designer] Sarah Greenwood and the art team, we looked at all the different shades of pink to determine how they would interact. As a little girl, I liked the brightest pinks, but Barbie Land would incorporate the full spectrum of the colour, so it was important to figure out where those bright pinks would live alongside our palest, pastel pink, and of course every tone of pink in between.

_On defying gravity…_

There’s no place for Newton’s laws in Barbie Land. There is no wind, there is no sun, no gravity and no water, but as filmmakers we do live in a world of physics, so when dealing with the reality of Barbie Land, there were the rules of Barbie Land and then there were the rules we’ve set up for the filmmaking, and then how those two things interacted. I’m in love with 1950s soundstage musicals, those wonderfully artificial spaces, and because Barbie was invented in 1959, it felt like we could ground everything in that look and not be so beholden to it. I want everyone to feel like they can reach up to the screen and touch everything, because that’s the great thing about dolls and toys. I remember standing in a Toys ‘R Us toy store, looking at Barbies and their accessories with the plastic over them, and wanting to take everything apart and touch everything!

_On the soundtrack and score…_

There’s a lot of music in the movie – that was always super important to me. Barbie has a level of optimism that influenced us when we were writing the script, a sort of sincerity mixed with joyfulness meets a ‘doesn’t everybody just want to dance?’ attitude. Mark [Ronson] really threaded that through the movie with the amazing artists who came in to contribute songs, like Dua Lipa, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Karol G… so many! It was such a treat to work with all these artists. And Mark and his partner, Andrew Wyatt, wrote an anthem of sorts for Ken, which Ryan sings, and it’s epic. We have a ballad that made me cry when I heard it. Mark and Andrew also wrote the score, and they wove that melody through several scenes.
