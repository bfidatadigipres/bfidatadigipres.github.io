Her publications include _Good Girls & Wicked Witches_ (2007), _Handsome Heroes & Vile Villains_ (2013), and _Discussing Disney_ (2020), as well as papers including ‘The Dark Prince and Dream Women: Walt Disney and Mid-Twentieth Century American Feminism’ (_Historical Journal of Film, Radio, and Television_, 2005), ‘Making it Disney’s _Snow_ _White_’ (_Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: New Perspectives on Production, Reception, Legacy_, 2021), and ‘On “Love Experts”, Evil Princes, Gullible Princesses, and _Frozen’_ (_The Oxford Handbook of Children’s Film_, 2022). She recently presented on Donald Duck as an American Everyman in Disney’s World War II shorts (and is currently writing this up for publication next year), and her most recent article, a journalistic piece called ‘Disney at 100’, has just been published (July 2023) in the 2023 edition of the _Children’s Media Yearbook_.

The **Disniversity Podcast** is a film-by-film crash course through the history of Disney’s animated classics – from film journalist **Ben Travis** and animation academic **Dr Sam Summers**. Ben is Deputy Online Editor at _Empire Magazine_, and has formerly worked at the _Evening Standard_, GQ, and _The Telegraph_. Sam is a Lecturer in Animation at Middlesex University London, and the author of _DreamWorks Animation: Intertextuality and Aesthetics in_ Shrek _and Beyond_. They met at Newcastle University on the student newspaper, and have been talking about films together ever since – more recently, with a microphone in front of them. Ben’s favourite Disney film is _Sleeping Beauty_; Sam’s favourite Disney film is _Pinocchio_ (or, Robert Altman’s _Popeye_).

**Sadeen Elyas** is a PhD candidate in Film Musicology at the University of Hull. Her research interests are film music (including the early use of sound in Hollywood cinema), animation studies, especially Disney, and the relationship between food and music in films. Her PhD research combines her interests, and looks at the use of sound and music as a storytelling agent in silent cinema and sound film, focusing on Disney films. She has published an academic chapter on Disney’s _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_’ film music.

In addition to her academic pursuits, Sadeen Elyas is a dedicated Saudi musician and composer. She enjoys blending Western and Arabic musical styles, incorporating elements of classical and Disney music into her own compositions. Sadeen has collaborated with various organisations, creating music for projects that address social issues. Recently, her work has been recognised and she was featured in _Hia_ magazine, a publication that showcases influential Arab women.

**Dr Helen Jacobsen** is Executive Director of The Attingham Trust. Formerly Senior Curator at the Wallace Collection, she has published on French eighteenth-century decorative art and collecting history, including _Gilded Interiors. Parisian Luxury and the Influence of Rome, 1770-89_ (2017) and a monograph on Marie-Antoinette’s cabinet maker, _Jean-Henri Riesener: Cabinetmaker to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette_ (2021). Most recently she curated Inspiring Walt Disney. The Animation of French Decorative Art, an exhibition held at the Wallace Collection in 2022 in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

**Dr Christopher Holliday** is Lecturer in Liberal Arts and Visual Cultures Education at King’s College London, specialising in Hollywood cinema, animation history, and contemporary digital media. He is the author of _The Computer-Animated Film: Industry, Style and Genre_ (2018), and co-editor of the anthologies _Fantasy/Animation: Connections Between Media, Mediums and Genres_ (2018) and _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: New Perspectives on Production, Reception, Legacy_ (2021). Christopher is also the co-creator of the website, blog, and podcast _Fantasy/Animation_.

**Chris McKenna**  joined MPC in 2014, having previously worked freelance within the VFX industry. Starting in MPC as an artist on Disney’s _Jungle Book_ remake, Chris then worked on several Disney projects, including _The Lion King_ and most recently _The Little Mermaid_. Over Chris’ time at MPC he’s worked his way through artist to Lead, to HOD and is currently Head of Creative for MPC overseeing all projects and supporting Heads of Departments. The public reaction and enjoyment of seeing beloved characters on the big screen is fundamentally what drives Chris’ passion to work within the VFX industry, also the community and artistic family within our digital world, along side the recent advancements in technological and creative workflows provide fuel for maintaining Chris’ drive – every new project brings new challenges which supplies never-ending opportunities to create emotive and artist centric movies.

**Dr Robyn Muir** is a Lecturer in Media and Communication at the University of Surrey. Her research focuses on the images of femininity within the Disney Princess Phenomenon. She has recently published her book exploring the representation of the princesses in their films and consumer and experiences across time – _The Disney Princess Phenomenon: A Feminist Analysis_. She is the founder and director of the Disney, Culture and Society Research Network.

**Hanna Flint** is a London-based author, critic, journalist and host who has been covering film and culture for nearly a decade. Her reviews, interviews and features have appeared in _GQ_, _Empire_, _The Guardian_, _Elle_ US, _Sight and Sound_, _Radio Times_, BBC Culture and elsewhere. Her recently published book _Strong Female Character_, is an unflinchingly honest and humorous account of her millennial journey towards self-acceptance through a cinematic lens. She is a frequent guest on BBC Radio 4’s _Front Row_, the co-host of MTV Movies and the weekly film review podcast Fade to Black, the co-founder of The First Film Club event series and podcast, and a member of London’s Critics’ Circle. She is a voice for gender equality, diversity and inclusion in the entertainment industry and an advocate for MENA representation as a writer of Tunisian heritage.
