Upon reaching the ‘new world’, a group of settlers begin to seize gold and land belonging to its indigenous peoples. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas, the daughter of Chief Powhatan, find themselves drawn to each other, but the relationship is fraught with danger as their very different worlds collide.

Disney’s historical drama may have significantly re-written historical events in order to appeal to the widest audience, but it also took its empowered heroine out of the fairy tale and into the real world.

There is something about the sheer scale of the success of Disney’s animated films, breaking box-office records with the nonchalant regularity of a butcher snapping the necks of chickens, that raises the hackles of critics. Ever since the publication of Dorfman and Mattelart’s 1971 Marxist critique _How to Read Donald Duck_, the Disney company has been constructed as an exemplar of capitalist cultural imperialism, permeating every nation on the earth with its seductive, easily translatable pop propaganda.

Dorfman and Mattelart were mainly concerned with the more disposable Donald Duck comic books, rather than the films. Yet, as the latter have grown in popularity and success and as ‘The Mouse’ – as _Variety_ likes to refer to the voracious rodent which is the Walt Disney Company proper – has grown to its global status, it has seemed ever more urgent to be vigilant of what subtextual messages might be contained within the cartoon texts. The Disney Version of stories is put under as much scrutiny as the testimony of policemen in Los Angeles courts. Thus, there were accusations of racism concerning _Aladdin_ and _The Lion King_, and critics and academics have questioned the images of women portrayed in _Beauty and the Beast_ and _The Little Mermaid_. It is as if we are holding the films responsible for much more than just entertaining children on a wet afternoon.

_Pocahontas_ is fascinating because it bears witness to the company’s attempt to grapple with these criticisms as well as to produce another record-breaking blockbuster that will soak up receipts as well in the midwest of America as that of Africa. Inevitably, it is fraught with contradictions and ironies. It is large and contains multitudes, as Walt Whitman said of himself; and like Whitman’s poetry, it is baggy, drawing on a distinctly American vernacular (both verbal and visual), and full of moments of real poetry, sharp pathos and patronising kitsch.

_Pocahontas_ is as politically correct as oatmeal cookies. Its heroine is tall, muscular and graceful, can steer rapids as well as Meryl Streep in _The River Wild_, and has a face so scrupulously uncaricatured she lacks cheekbones and any more nose than a pair of nostrils lest she be confused with her hook-nosed ancestors in cartoon history. All her expression resides in her eyes, as dewy and doe-eyed as Bambi’s mother before she gets shot. The rest of the tribe are equally circumspectly drawn, while the white settlers range from exaggerated grotesques (baddies like Ratcliffe) to more realistic figures depending on how likeable they are. The film’s world view constructs a great chain of being in which the Native Americans are poised at the pinnacle, neatly inverting Renaissance concepts of hierarchy.

The filmmakers here seem acutely aware that they are dealing for the first time in a major way with ‘true story’, albeit one clouded in myth and predictably revised here. No matter how ersatz, the viewer is constantly aware of how historical details are being mobilised for verisimilitude. When Smith describes Pocahontas’ people as ‘savages’ in his accurately 17th-century way, her offence is assuaged by his explaining that it is ‘just a word’. Indeed, a curious concern with language permeates the film, with the natives speaking an authentic North American dialect which quickly morphs into American-accented English. Much magical play is made of Smith and Pocahontas’ immediate grasp of one another’s languages, literalised in a kiss. One would almost imagine that the story-people had been brushing up on the linguist-philosopher Tzvetan Todorov’s _The Conquest of America_, which posited that the Native Americans’ apparent inability to understand Western language became the cornerstone of a whole discourse which explained their ‘savagery’.

The anxiety of accuracy muddles much throughout the film. It showcases how much animation’s motion-control and background-generating technology has advanced. Character movements, especially Pocahontas’ hair (tricky stuff to animate), are perfectly done, and some of the shots ‘underwater’ are nothing less than exquisite. However, the palette feels all wrong. The British scenes and characters are rendered in drab sepia colours so that the Native American setting, all bright and brutally blue skies, will seem all the nicer and friendlier. It would seem to me that a more muted natural palette would have been more appropriate to the latter culture, but I suppose the merchandisers, who favour a more garish, child-luring range of hues, had to be appeased.

The art direction alone belies the forces that threaten to tug _Pocahontas_ apart: on the one hand, the natural world must be stylised, with faint native symbols accenting the wind sweeping the leaves to suggest the harmony of their culture with the environment; but on the other hand the film’s commitment to corrective historicising and verisimilitude reigns in the exaggeration which is animation’s stock-and-trade. As a solution the film resorts to the gestures of the epic – huge landscapes, swelling choruses, even split-screen effects at the climax which recall Abel Gance’s _Napoléon_.

In the end, the film does get to you. It’s Disney’s darkest and most tragic animated film, even though it pulls back from telling the true historical ending – the real Pocahontas came back to England with Smith, died shortly after arriving and was buried in Gravesend. And though most children probably won’t yet know it, they’ll soon learn that this story with its ‘happy’ ending depicting a final concord between natives and settlers only begins a more chilling history concerning a genocide that would span centuries of horror. It’s this ‘front-story’ which truly brings tears to the eyes when the credits roll, and by suggesting it, perhaps in a cloudy but well-meaning way, this film tries to expiate a little of the guilt that might be felt by one of the West’s most successful capitalist organisations.
