_+ intro and discussion_

Now acknowledged as a landmark animated film, this Disney feature is a musical anthology featuring the great conductor Leopold Stokowski. Eight classical pieces by composers including Bach, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and Beethoven are presented with stylistically varied animated sequences, ranging from swirling abstracts to a comedy ballet (with ostriches) and an appearance by Mickey Mouse.

**Please note:** this film contains images, including racial stereotyping, that reflect views prevalent in its time that may cause offence today.

The post-screening discussion will be hosted by Autism Through Cinema Podcast co-host Lillian Crawford.
