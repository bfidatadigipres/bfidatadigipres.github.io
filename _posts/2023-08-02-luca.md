Disney and Pixar’s original feature film _Luca_ is a fun and heartwarming story about friendship, stepping out of your comfort zone and two teenage sea monsters who experience a life-changing summer. ‘This movie is about the friendships that change us,’ says director Enrico Casarosa. ‘It’s a love letter to the summers of our youth – those formative years when you’re finding yourself.’

Adds producer Andrea Warren, ‘It’s a magical coming-of-age-story about remembering the people who shaped us along the way.’

Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, _Luca_ is a story about one boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, Alberto, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply held secret: they are both sea monsters from another world just below the water’s surface.

‘Luca is a shy, polite, introverted, rule-following kid who has a secret desire to see the world and learn all he can,’ says screenwriter Jesse Andrews. ‘But he’s been told his whole life that sea monsters should never go above the surface of the water where all the interesting stuff seems to be happening.’

So it’s no surprise that Luca harbours a secret fascination with all things human. His curiosity is especially sparked when he discovers items that have floated down from the surface. ‘Luca knows nothing of the surface,’ says screenwriter Mike Jones. ‘So these items are glimpses of another world – as if it were an object of an extraterrestrial landing on Earth. He’s a young imaginative kid, so when he meets Alberto – who has actual knowledge of these objects – it’s incredibly intriguing to Luca.’

Indeed, Alberto, a fellow sea monster, has ventured beyond the surface, making him the subject of intense respect as far as Luca is concerned – at least once he gets over the shock of it all. Because, it turns out, sea monsters have the ability to blend in with humans. ‘Alberto literally drags Luca out of the water, and we discover that these sea monsters have the magical ability to transform into human form when they’re dry,’ says Casarosa. ‘Our inspiration was sea life like octopuses that are able to camouflage and change the way they look.’

The result? Carte blanche to roam the land where humans dwell. And while Luca quite enjoys this freedom, he realises that the danger his family has warned him about is not entirely unfounded. ‘There’s a big misunderstanding between humans and sea monsters,’ says Jacob Tremblay, who lends his voice to Luca. ‘They all fear each other. Sea monsters strictly avoid the surface, and humans are eager to hunt down sea monsters and prove they exist.’

Luca and Alberto embrace their new surroundings with one caveat top of mind: stay dry. ‘If they get rained on or splashed, their secret could be revealed,’ says Jones.

Their sense of adventure – risks aside – is symbolised in large part by an image of a Vespa scooter that hangs in Alberto’s hideout. ‘It represents escape, freedom, friendship and the promise of exploring the amazing world around them,’ says Andrews.

The story, set in the late 1950s-early 1960s, captures the magic and adventure of summertime. The Italian seaside setting was created in a stunning painterly style Casarosa championed, and stems from his childhood. ‘I had the luck to grow up in Genoa – a port city on the Italian Riviera,’ he says. ‘It’s a very specific coast because it’s really steep – the mountains rise up from the ocean. The towns are stuck in time – they’re so picturesque. I always imagined them like little monsters coming out of the water.’

Hence sea monsters – though, to be fair, the underwater creatures in _Luca_ are not exactly scary – slimy, creepy creatures aren’t the director’s storytelling sensibility. ‘Sea monsters are a metaphor, really, for feeling different or excluded,’ says Casarosa. ‘I love the sense that all of our characters in some way feel different or unusual. Luca and Alberto so passionately want to be part of this other world – but they fear they won’t be accepted as they are. And yet, they love being sea monsters.’

Adds Warren, ‘There’s a lovely theme about wanting to be a part of something outside of our immediate families – wanting to experience cultures beyond our own. Luca discovers the power of exploring and celebrating another culture, while learning to honour and share his own.’

Inspired by the creatures from old maps dating back to the Renaissance, as well as scientific illustrations of fish from the region and Japanese dragons and serpents, artists created sea monsters that were believable, appealing and, importantly, expressive – because the story revolves around a burgeoning friendship between Luca and Alberto. ‘Their friendship brings out the best in Luca and gives him the confidence to spread his wings and take more risks,’ says executive producer Kiri Hart. ‘It’s an absolutely lovely, heartwarming story about friendship and how our friends can unlock certain parts of us, giving us the opportunity to discover something about ourselves.’
