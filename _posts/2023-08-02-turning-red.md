Disney and Pixar’s _Turning Red_ introduces Meilin Lee, a confident, slightly dorky 13-year-old with a solid group of friends, an admirable record in school and a better-than-average relationship with her family for the most part. Meilin – Mei to her friends – has every reason to expect smooth sailing throughout the rest of her middle school career. But according to director Domee Shi, that’s not how life goes for most 13-year-olds. ‘I really wanted to explore the conflicts of a young teen girl – how she’s torn between being a good daughter and embracing her true messy self.’

The mother-daughter relationship takes centre stage in _Turning Red_, and it’s a theme that’s very close to the director’s heart. Shi, who helmed Pixar’s 2018 Oscar®-winning short _Bao_, says that when she was asked why the little dumpling in the short was male, her response was – it turns out – prophetic.  ‘I said it would take a whole feature to unpack the mother-daughter relationship,’ says Shi. ‘It was actually a big motivating factor in my pitch for _Turning Red_. It’s never black and white. At the beginning of the movie, Mei genuinely loves her relationship with her mom, but she’s being pulled in new directions – as everyone her age is. It’s a time of big changes.’

In _Turning Red_, this phase of growing up is marked in an unexpected, can’t hide-from-it, larger-than-life way: when Mei’s emotions get the better of her, she ‘poofs’ into a giant red panda. ‘One minute, everything’s perfect,’ says Shi. ‘And then, just like with all of us, all of a sudden there’s terror everywhere. She’s way taller, hungrier, more emotional. She’s, in fact, turned into a giant red panda, and the only way to turn back into a human girl is to take deep breaths, calm herself down and control her emotions. It’s kind of like _The Incredible Hulk_, but cuter.’

According to producer Lindsey Collins, _Turning Red_ is set in Toronto, Canada, in the early 2000s. ‘It takes place in a familiar time and place that kind of roots us all in reality,’ says Collins. ‘It’s not a magical world. That’s important because the story itself is pretty fantastical with a girl that hits a magical kind of puberty and turns into a big red panda – yet we can all still relate.’

‘It’s a coming-of-age story about change and those transitional moments,’ continues Collins. ‘It’s about that time in our lives when we’re trying to figure out who we are. We have a girl who is torn between her family and her friends, learning that she’s not at all who she thought she was. And we have the mother whose daughter is suddenly interested in strange music and boys – a mother who struggles with letting go so her child can become who she needs to be. It’s a universal theme that rings true whether you’re the parent, the child, or maybe both.’

But, says Collins, it’s not just that profound relatability that sets _Turning Red_ apart from other coming-of-age stories – it’s Shi’s approach to filmmaking. ‘Domee has an energy to her that I find really engaging – she’s an engine,’ says Collins. ‘She moves fast; she’s super decisive. She brings an unexpected and unapologetic quirkiness to her storytelling, the stylisation, and to the  entire film.’

Director Domee Shi kicked off efforts behind _Turning Red_ with an important mission topping her to-do list: getting to know her characters. ‘I think finding the characters as early as possible is the most important thing to making a good story,’ she says. ‘The first goal of a filmmaker is having the audience fall in love with your characters – being interested enough in them in those first five to ten minutes to want to sit down and follow their journey for the next hour and a half.’

Shi and her team went on to develop the kind of characters that would capture viewers’ hearts and hold on till the credits rolled. Leading the pack, of course, is 13-year-old Meilin Lee, and Shi surrounded her protagonist with a crew of friends and family – each with a distinct personality that both complements and contrasts with Mei as she navigates adolescence. ‘This is a very personal story for Domee,’ says producer Lindsey Collins. ‘It’s a mother-daughter story set in the early 2000s, which is super cool. And it has a voice that feels very different – the reaction here at Pixar to the first scene [we shared internally] mirrored the way that I feel about this film: I’ve never seen this before.’

The look of the characters, adds Collins, is similarly distinct. ‘Everyone had to tap their inner 13-year-olds to capture the style Domee wanted,’ says Collins. ‘It’s a world seen through the eyes of Mei. Everything is vibrant and colourful. The design is textured and tactile and chunky, and the animation style and, every now and then, facial expressions are pushed. The characters are caricatured, and the way they move and pose is fresh. Domee’s stylisation is extended through art, animation, camera and lighting, and her passion for anime shines through.’

Says Shi, ‘I grew up watching anime. I love how fast and loose they play with emotion – how the expressions can change in an instant. It just felt perfect for a film about an adolescent girl who’s on an emotional roller coaster with all of the mood swings.’

The character line-up includes Mei, her inner circle of friends and family and members of a boy band known as 4*Town. Filmmakers called on a rich roster of voice talent to help bring the characters to life. ‘The Toronto setting of this story called for a diverse cast,’ says associate executive producer Adrian Molina. ‘Hopefully more and more people are seeing experiences like their own on the big screen. _Turning Red_ offers a unique perspective of a 13-year-old Chinese Canadian that – at its heart – shows how we’re all connected.’
