In its 92-year history, Walt Disney Animation Studios has created a long and storied legacy of talking-animal films – from Mickey Mouse’s debut short _Steamboat Willie_ to _Bambi_, _Dumbo_, _The Jungle_ _Book_, _Robin Hood_ and _The_ _Lion_ _King_. WDAS returns to the wild with the feature film _Zootropolis_. ‘We all grew up watching the great Disney animal films – we were immersed in those worlds,’ says director Byron Howard. ‘My favourite childhood film was _Robin_ _Hood_, and we wanted to honour that legacy, but in a new and different way that dives even deeper. We started by asking, “What would a mammal metropolis look like if it were designed by animals?” The idea was incredibly exciting to us.’

Comprised of neighbourhoods that celebrate different cultures, Zootropolis is a city like no other. There’s ritzy Sahara Square for desert animals, Tundratown for the polar bears and moose, the hot and humid Rain Forest District, Little Rodentia for the tiniest mammals, and Bunnyburrow for the millions and millions of bunnies. The downtown area, Savanna Central, is a melting pot where a wide array of mammals from every environment come together.

Zootropolis is a place where no matter what you are – from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew – you can be anything. But when rookie officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with Nick Wilde – a fast-talking, scam-artist fox – to solve a mystery.

‘At its core, _Zootropolis_ is a buddy movie,’ says director Rich Moore. ‘Judy and Nick – a rabbit and a fox – are natural enemies by definition. So these characters don’t exactly get along at first. They come to the relationship with ideas about each other – beliefs that aren’t informed or accurate.’

According to Howard, the fact that the buddies don’t get along fuels the film’s comedy. ‘Judy is the eternal optimist who believes anyone can be anything – it’s the city’s motto, after all,’ he says. ‘Nick is the complete opposite. He’s a cynic. He believes we are what we are. So we put this country bumpkin who’s full of vim and vigour in the middle of the big city alongside Nick – the realist – and he gets to have a lot of fun messing with her. But she has a few tricks up her sleeve.’

Filmmakers conceived and built the vast and detailed world of Zootropolis, populating it with 64 different species of animals that retain what makes each animal so amazing in the real world – but these animals talk and wear pants. ‘The team spent 18 months just researching animals,’ says producer Clark Spencer. ‘We met with animal experts from all over the world, including Disney’s Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World. We travelled 9,000 miles to Kenya, Africa, for a two-week deep dive into animal personality and behaviour. We wanted each species of animal to be real, to feel authentic and to be based on their real-world behaviour.’

‘I think all of us were profoundly changed by our trip to Africa,’ adds Jared Bush, who is co-director and one of the screenwriters. ‘It’s such an amazing experience, being around hundreds, thousands of animals. In this movie, we want to feel that density, which is a lot of work. We came back after that trip with a sincere need to make it right.’

_Zootropolis_ features a remarkable roster of voice talent tapped to help bring the mammal metropolis to life, including Ginnifer Goodwin (ABC’s _Once upon a_ _Time_, _Something Borrowed_, _Walk the Line_) as rookie rabbit officer Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman (_Horrible_ _Bosses_ _2_, _This Is Where I Leave You_) voices the con-artist fox, Nick Wilde. We feel fortunate to have this calibre of talent – they’ve really embraced all of this story’s heart and humour in a way I don’t think we’ve seen before,’ says Spencer. ‘We recorded Ginnifer and Jason together as much as their schedules would allow. I think we have something special happening, which is exciting.’

Research is the foundation for all of Walt Disney Animation Studios’ films – something executive producer John Lasseter believes is required to create a great story. So when the filmmakers behind _Zootropolis_ decided to create an all-animal world, they went wild – literally – when it came to research. In addition to their trek to Africa, team members spent time at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and San Diego’s Wild Animal Park; they interviewed several experts and visited the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. ‘We did about 18 months of really solid research into animals,’ says director Byron Howard. ‘We studied how they interact in the wild, how they socialise and how their individual communities are built in the natural world.

‘We found that the majority of animals – 90 percent – are prey,’ continues Howard. ‘Only 10 percent are predators. So while we always assumed that predators ruled the animal world, they’re actually the minority. We talked to anthropologists and sociologists and took a look way back through human history – any time you have a majority and minority, social issues arise. We learned and observed that animals of all kinds tend to stay with animals that look like them; they find refuge and protection within their individual groups and tend to avoid animals that are different.’

So the research led the filmmakers to a story that deals with stereotypes and bias. ‘We set out to make a funny animal movie,’ says Howard. ‘But the more digging we did, we saw an opportunity to talk about something important – while still having great fun with the world, the characters and the story.’

According to head of story Josie Trinidad, filmmakers first looked at prey versus predator and how that would affect a community like Zootropolis. ‘Then we leaned into animal stereotypes – elephants never forget, foxes are sly, rabbits are timid – everyone has a stereotype they’re fighting against. That’s something everyone in the audience can appreciate.’
