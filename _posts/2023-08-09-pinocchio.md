Disney’s _Pinocchio_ is the first cartoon feature to allegorise animation’s miracle, the creation of life. By _Pinocchio_’s release in 1940, cinema audiences had seen many fantastic births, but usually of monsters: Paul Wegener’s clay Golem, Fritz Lang’s robot Maria, the lumbering Boris Karloff. Early cartoons, meanwhile, reduced their life-giving magics to jaunty conjuring, inspired by the lightning artists of vaudeville. The connection is explicit in J. Stuart Blackton’s _Humorous Phases of Funny Faces_ (1906), perhaps the first cartoon ever. The first chalk drawing is by a visible hand, but then the magician drops out and the faces move by themselves.

In contrast, Disney couches Pinocchio’s birth in wondrous fairytale metaphor, but with a showman’s wink to the audience. A winged Blue Fairy in a glittering dress touches her wand to a boy marionette and declares, ‘Little puppet made of pine; Wake, the gift of life is thine!’ Pinocchio wakes amid sunbursts, stretches and blinks his blue painted eyes, and we cut to the gnome-like spectator Jiminy Cricket, voiced by vaudeville star Cliff Edwards. Jiminy looks at us, lets out an impressed ‘Phew!’ and chirps, ‘What they can’t do these days!’ You can almost see Walt beaming with pride.

_Pinocchio_ was the second cartoon feature released by Disney, three years after _Snow White_. It was a flop; war in Europe blighted foreign sales, while some critics argue the film was too dark for American viewers. Yet many reference books cite _Pinocchio_ as the greatest cartoon feature ever, even if its images and characters haven’t sunk into the popular memory as deeply as _Bambi_, _Dumbo_ and _Snow White_.

The technology unites handicrafts with high-tech. _Pinocchio_’s pictures were interpreted in 3D through the multiplane, a giant camera holding glass sheets on which cels, backgrounds and overlays were painted separately. When Pinocchio’s alpine village wakes, we swoop and turn overhead like a bird, looking down at the flocking crowds, though it’s typical of the pell-mell narrative that we never see this bustle again.

The film’s greatness is haphazard, its magic almost shapeless. It has five villains (including a monster whale), untidily sprawling set-pieces, broad panto knockabout (exaggerated double-takes abound) and moments of high terror. There’s the horror-film shadow of a doomed delinquent, turning from boy into donkey), and the shock-and-awe climax, where Pinocchio and the toymaker Gepetto are chased by a whale like a roaring locomotive. If _Pinocchio_ has a self-metaphor, it’s Gepetto’s fantastic toyshop array of clocks shaped like animals, birds, dancers and delinquents, all brassily chiming the hour – though Gepetto must still check what time it actually is.

The carvings and clockwork of Gepetto’s home advertise the animators’ handicraft. The toyshop scenes drip enclosed and intimate charm, modulated by Gepetto’s cranky cat (animated by Eric Larson). Cliff Edwards as Jiminy was the first celebrity voice in Disney’s features, a precursor to Phil Harris in  _The Jungle Book_ and Robin Williams in _Aladdin._ Edwards, though, can mix fanny gags with snowy purity, and his tenor singing of ‘Fate steps in and sees you _through…_’ conjures a lost world of Hollywood gentility.

Disney’s Pinocchio is an adorable child, far from the devil doll created by Italian author Carlo Lorenzini, writing as Carlo Collodi. The original character swung between cruelty, indolence and prima-donna sentimentality, more ‘Looney Tunes’ than Disney. Walt didn’t corrupt the source; Pinocchio was an innocent in a popular 1938 US stage version directed by Yasha Frank. Disney’s and Collodi’s Pinocchios are often contrasted by pundits looking to denounce one or the other, but they can coexist. (Spielberg references Disney’s Pinocchio in _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, 1977, and Collodi’s in _Artificial Intelligence A.I._, 2001)

Collodi’s puppet is hero of a rickety junior _Bildungsroman_, a round of painful falls and lessons. Disney’s Pinocchio just needs to become a real boy to escape wicked exploiters, like the foxy J. Worthington Foulfellow with his red fur and quizzical, questing malignity, voiced by a bluff Walter Catlett. Far worse is the coachman who takes urchins to Pleasure Island, a cockney fiend who leers, ‘They never come back… AS BOYS!,’ and turns into a penny-dreadful cross between a gargoyle and Batman’s Joker (invented that year). The whinnying puppetmaster Stromboli, animated by Bill Tytla, is a campily monstrous Santa Claus. His rolling flesh and scarlet mouth foreshadow the rampaging whale at the end.

None of these evildoers are punished or destroyed, but just melt away like lemon drops, ready to entrap the next careless child. Even at the happy ending, we’re not allowed to linger at the celebrations, but follow Jiminy out into the cold night – though a night suffused with light, where each twinkling star equates to a small but sturdy conscience. Disney pours New World optimism over unkillable European nightmares; _Pinocchio_ opened just as Europe was falling under tyranny.
