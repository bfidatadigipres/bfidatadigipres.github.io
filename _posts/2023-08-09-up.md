Pete Docter, director of Pixar’s new hit _Up_, describes his creative process in watery terms: ‘It’s as though we’re in a pool splashing around, looking for things. It’s being in it, just feeling – and then stopping and analysing.’

This process led to some striking visual conceits in _Up_, which opens in cinemas in both 2D and 3D formats. It’s the story of Carl, a curmudgeonly widower who attaches his house to thousands of balloons and flies away. At one point, he’s shown grimly pulling the floating house on a rope through the dreamlike landscape of the table-top mountains of South America – an image reminiscent of Werner Herzog’s _Fitzcarraldo_.

Carl’s wife Ellie, who dies at the start of the film, is evoked through empty spaces such as a vacant armchair. ‘Ellie is really the drive through the whole film,’ says Docter. ‘Without the audience feeling something about Carl and Ellie’s relationship, and Carl’s need to fill it, I think you’d lose interest.’

Producer Jonas Rivera concurs, describing _Up_’s tear-jerking opening as the launch pad for the fantastical adventures that follow. ‘We need to set the stakes of the film, so you’ll go with us. We’re asking the audience to take a pretty big leap in terms of Carl’s house, the dogs [which talk] and the planes [piloted by the talking dogs]. We felt that showing Carl and Ellie’s married life was important in allowing all that to happen.’

Both _Up_ and [the same year’s] _Coraline_ use 3D much as 1939’s _The Wizard of Oz_ used Technicolor: to contrast a flat, mundane world with wide-open, fantastic vistas. Yet _Up_ ultimately comes to the same conclusion as _Oz_: that happiness resides in the real world, not in flights of fancy.

Some reviewers have objected to the grown-up content in Pixar’s films, saying that it would baffle younger viewers – how do children respond to the ‘married life’ sequence, for example? ‘For most, it seems to go over their heads a little bit,’ says Rivera. ‘None of them seem too crushed. We get more responses about the dogs, or a giant bird hurting its leg… things that frighten a kid.’

Docter and Rivera point out that _Up_’s very first scenes show Carl and Ellie as children, engaging the sympathies of youngsters that way. (Another child, a chubby boy scout, turns up to accompany Carl in the main story.) The young Ellie was voiced by Docter’s daughter Elie, who also made the drawings in Ellie’s handmade ‘Adventure Book’, which plays a crucial role in the film.

Pixar’s films have been criticised for featuring few female characters. Did Docter ever consider making Ellie the protagonist instead of Carl? ‘We did consider it,’ he says. ‘But we developed this grouchy character. Maybe I’m sexist, but it didn’t appeal as an old woman who would slam the door in people’s faces.’ But they have worked on writing more female characters, he points out; and Pixar’s first film by a woman director, Brenda Chapman’s _Bear and the Bow_, is scheduled for 2011.

Pixar’s recent experiments _WALL-E_ and _Up_ have been critical and commercial hits, with _Up_’s US box office second only to _Finding Nemo_’s for an animated film. But while Pixar continues the tradition of Disney-derived cartoon caricature (_Up_’s vision of South America has a painterly, graphic design, inspired by the Disney artist Mary Blair), James Cameron’s _Avatar_ and Spielberg’s _The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn_ are about to usher in a new generation of motion-captured animation technology. Will Pixar have to adapt?

‘It’s exciting when there’s something you can do now that you couldn’t do before,’ says Rivera. ‘If we could see a Tintin that looks like something we’ve never seen before, and still has the appeal of Tintin, then I’ll pay and go. As an audience, I can’t wait… But I still love traditional animation so much that I want to keep the pendulum aiming that way.’  
**Andrew Osmond, _Sight and Sound_, November 2009**

_Up_ opens with a sepia-hued, flickering Movietone newsreel trumpeting the exploits of fictional 1930s aeronautical explorer Charles Muntz. The image pans back over the cinema audience and, completing its self-conscious wink at the viewer, spins to alight on the face of awestruck eight-year-old Carl – whose pilot goggles will remind you of your 3D glasses if you’re playing the game right. With the unspoken, lyrical articulation that characterises much of Pixar’s best work, these opening seconds capture the film’s peculiar charm and poignancy, which rest on a bittersweet seesaw between past and present, the ideal and the real.

The film’s unlikely protagonists – crotchety septuagenarian widower Carl and barrel-shaped eight-year-old Russell (voiced with breathy, gap-toothed gusto by non-professional Jordan Nagai) – fit the well-worn odd-couple mould, yet also encapsulate all that feels so nattily contemporary about _Up_. Where _WALL-E_ ’s futuristic space odyssey was too photo-realistically pristine for some, _Up_ sweeps Pixar gloriously and cartoonishly back into earth’s orbit.

Fittingly for Pixar’s first feature film to be conceived in 3D (though under its Disney umbrella _Bolt_ was officially first past the post), _Up_ makes novel use of the format. In particular, the final airborne zeppelin showdown between Carl and Muntz, his childhood hero-turned-villain (part Howard Hughes, part Charles Lindbergh), is used to transmit a sense of vertiginous, as opposed to just inanely eye-popping, depth. Yet for all its sense of carefully captured zeitgeist, _Up_’s actual narrative feels as though it might have been feverishly conceived on the back of a beer mat. It more than gets away with it, magpieing from balloon-fuelled Phileas Fogg adventure, doffing its cap to Miyazaki along the way, to a lost world populated by a hierarchical race of ‘talking’ dogs.

What prevents _Up_ from feeling merely ragtag is, on one level, the consistent laugh-out-loud humour; more unexpectedly, it’s the lyrically rendered themes of grief, childlessness and nostalgia that course through the film. These are established in the opening minutes with a remarkable wordless montage, which plays out Carl’s marriage to his sweetheart Ellie, the subsequent discovery of her infertility, and the daily travails that prevent the couple reaching Paradise Falls – their South American Shangri-la – until creeping old age and infirmity mean it’s too late. Building from here, Michael Giacchino’s outstanding thematic score, surpassing his earlier work on _The Incredibles_ and _Ratatouille_, provides _Up_’s heartbeat. Shifting from heady waltz to wistful piano solo, a simple recurring melody encapsulates the persistent pull of ever deferred childhood dreams, at once nostalgic and fantastical.

These are themes as deeply imbued in _Up_’s aesthetic as they are in its characterisation and narrative. The opening newsreel sequence, for example, was run through 16mm optical film to effect the requisite ‘authentic’ wobbliness our senses expect. Electronic musicians have long sought to emulate analogue sound, and a similar trick is at work here. Like Henry Selick’s _Coraline_, which opens with a stunning sequence of minutely observed needlework, _Up_ paradoxically expresses its technical sophistication through such exquisite fetishising of the hand-crafted, the palpably manmade and perishable, whether it’s crackly archive footage, Ellie’s dog-eared scrapbook or the cherished, rusty soda-bottle lid – ‘the Ellie badge’ – that Carl wears on his lapel. It’s more than a sentimental sweetener to forestall criticism of CGI’s ‘flawlessness’, though. In _Up_’s case, such styling enhances a delightful tale that manages to celebrate its rich storytelling heritage while simultaneously ushering in the new. Another first for Pixar: reducing audiences of critics to weeping into their 3D glasses.
