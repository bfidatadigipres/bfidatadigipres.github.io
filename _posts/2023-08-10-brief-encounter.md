**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_Brief Encounter_ has always been regarded as a quintessentially British film, typical of British cinema and of Britishness itself. This has been its glory but also a stick to beat it with. It was swiftly heralded, at home and abroad, as the acme of British cinema. There was talk of it representing a ‘British school’, not only by C.A. Lejeune (who used the phrase) but also by André Bazin (though he retracted his enthusiasm a few years later). It was straightaway a reference point in British writing about film, notably in the work of the _Penguin Film Review_ and Roger Manvell, which set the agenda for the serious consideration of cinema in Britain for many years. The script was published (a rare enough accolade) in 1950 as one of _Three British Screenplays_ and in 1974 as one of four _Masterworks of the British Cinema_. By the 1960s it was also being excoriated for the very same Britishness, by the journal _Movie_, for instance, and in Raymond Durgnat’s book _A Mirror for England_. Its place has nonetheless remained secure.

There is a still from the film on the cover of Denis Gifford’s 1968 ‘illustrated guide’, _British Cinema_, and both on the cover and as a backdrop to the opening pages of a chapter on ‘The British Tradition’ in Gilbert Adair and Nick Roddick’s _A Night at the Pictures: Ten Decades of British Film_, published in 1985 for ‘British Film Year’. In such general accounts of British cinema, _Brief_ _Encounter_ is taken to be both so well known and so archetypal as to be the obvious emblematic choice. In the Adair and Roddick volume, 21 critics (including such specialists in British cinema as Andy Medhurst, Rachael Low, Pam Cook, James Park, Colin McArthur and Charles Barr) were invited to nominate their top ten British films; in the resultant poll of polls, _Brief Encounter_ came third. Beyond this, _Brief Encounter_ has also come to be taken as a symbol of Britishness itself. When anglophile Helena Hanff goes to the cinema in Manhattan in the film of _84 Charing_ _Cross Road_ (1986), it is a screening of _Brief Encounter_ that sets her dreaming longingly of London again (though, of course, _Brief Encounter_ is not set in London, and London is not Britain – the vagueness is the point). It has become part of the contemporary concern with heritage. A still figures on the cover of Nicola Beauman’s study of the inter-war British woman’s novel, a work concerned (along with its publisher, Virago) to rescue a wealth of British fiction that had been in danger of being consigned to oblivion. Heritage as tourism is equally at home with _Brief Encounter_. More than one disused railway station has been opened up as a _Brief Encounter_ tea room, though Carnforth station in Lancashire, where the film was shot, has slid  
into decay. *

_Brief Encounter_’s Englishness is something very specific and limited, but if I try to put my finger on why _Brief Encounter_ affects me so, it is this Englishness that seems to get it best. It has mainly to do with the way the film handles emotions, the heartbreakingly touching awkwardness of its characters, what Laura describes as the English being so ‘shy and difficult’. In fact this quality may be found in such nationally diverse films as _Tokyo Story_, _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ and _Babette’s Feast_, but then perhaps it is very ‘English’ of me to love those films too.

It is common to characterise this way with emotions as inhibited or even emotionless. The English are cold fish with stiff upper lips. Yet this is to mistake restraint for repression and lack of expression for lack of feeling. To see _Brief Encounter_ as only cups of tea, banal conversation and guilt is not really to see or hear it at all. When Laura praises Alec for behaving ‘so beautifully’ when Dolly joins them in their last moments together, praises him because ‘no one could have guessed what he was feeling’, this does not give us a warrant to fail to see (to ‘guess’) why Alec and Laura act with restraint or how much and deeply they feel. On the one hand, their – and especially Laura’s – holding back from going with their longing for one another is not just conventionality or inhibition, but also a sense of affection and loyalty to others, a desire not to hurt anyone. Such niceness is for women indeed inextricable from the internalised address of patriarchy - Laura’s unheard confession to Fred begins by saying that she can’t tell him because he would be hurt ‘and oh, my dear, I don’t want you to be hurt’. The sense of English restraint being to do with gentleness and consideration for others may also be felt to sit ill with the actual record of British imperialism. It is an illusory ideal – but not an unattractive or contemptible one.

Such restraint is not the absence of feeling. Indeed, there can be no concept of restraint without an acknowledgement of feeling – restraint must keep something emotional in check. In _Brief Encounter_ the gestures the characters make, what they say and how they say it, are seldom overtly and directly expressive (though Alec’s declaration of love and Laura’s ‘I can’t go on’ speech are in fact very direct), but there is a huge pressure of emotion: in her saying to Alec, after she has so obviously fallen for him as he talks of his specialism, ‘It’s been so very nice – I’ve enjoyed my afternoon enormously’, in Alec’s pressing Laura’s shoulder to say goodbye for the last time; behind Laura’s eyes in every close-up of her.

Part of the pleasure of _Brief Encounter_ is simply the recognition of the way that restraint, not wanting to hurt, wanting to be nice, desiring comfort, stymie emotional abandon. The very familiarity of this for some people is a pleasure because it confirms part of how we experience our affective lives. There is an extra pull too in what I think of as a nostalgia for ordinariness: the very dowdiness of _Brief_ _Encounter_ evokes the cosy lure of normality.

Yet if _Brief Encounter_ recognises the difficulty of going with one’s feelings for a certain strain of Englishness, it also recognises the strain, fully registers the surging of emotion. It is because of both the social pressures toward and the genuine appeal of comfy conformity, both so meticulously realised, that the desire to love against the grain comes across so powerfully. Moreover, _Brief Encounter_’s recourse to music and to filmic devices also suggests, in this quite extraordinarily verbal film, the limitations of everyday speech to express emotion. Far from lacking emotion, the film is throbbing with it but also registering that emotion cannot be pinned down, summed up, that emotion is overwhelming. That is why _Brief Encounter_ is not only a ‘lovely’, but also a vibrantly ‘good’ film.
