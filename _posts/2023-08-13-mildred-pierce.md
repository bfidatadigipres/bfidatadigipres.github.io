**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

‘She was thirty-seven years old, fat, and getting a little shapeless. She had lost everything she had worked for, over long and weary years. The one living thing she bad loved had turned on her repeatedly, with tooth and fang, and now bad left her without so much as a kiss or a pleasant goodbye. Her only crime, if she had committed one, was that she bad loved this girl too well.’  
**James M. Cain, _Mildred Pierce_, 1941**  

Director Michael Curtiz was confident in many genres, and 1945’s _Mildred Pierce_ combines at least two of them. The melodramatic narrative of an ambitious housewife’s rise and fall, demonstrating Curtiz’s enduring preference for ‘homey pictures’, is cloaked in elements of classic film _noir_, which makes for an especially cold-hearted weepie.

Joan Crawford stars as Mildred, a suburban woman striving to give her daughters the opportunities she never had by transforming from a stay-at-home mother, ‘born in a kitchen’, to a divorced businesswoman running a string of restaurants. Tragically, Mildred’s sacrifices are made in support of a child whose monstrous appetites and self-interest offer a cruel exaggeration of her own humbler desires. Young Veda Pierce (Ann Blyth, who beat Shirley Temple to the role) remains one of cinema’s most memorable villains, and the electric mother-daughter confrontations are deeply unsettling. The structure of the film is neatly symmetrical, and on repeat viewing the parallels between Veda’s rise and Mildred’s descent move into crisp focus, their mother-daughter story punctuated by two sharp slaps to the face and the gunshots that ring out at each end of the film.

It was a happier story of reinvention for Crawford, as Mildred was her first substantial role for Warner Bros after MGM had quietly terminated her contract, and she won an Oscar for her performance, which bristles authentically with resentment and determination. The film, its cinematography and screenplay as well as Blyth and Eve Arden’s supporting performances were all also worthily nominated but failed to win. It’s tempting to compare Mildred’s metamorphosis not just to Crawford’s late-career revival, but to her earlier transformation from Lucille LeSueur the chorus girl to the 1930s film star with a crisp new name.

Veda is at her most vicious when she drags up her mother’s past: ‘You think just because you made a little money you can get a new hairdo and some expensive clothes and turn yourself into a lady. But you can’t, because you’ll never be anything other than a common frump whose father lived over a grocery store and whose mother took in washing.’ Veda’s own pretensions are just as transparent, though, from her clatter of French phrases to her sleazy blackmail plot and her clumsy flirtation with her stepfather. And just like her mother, Veda realises that paid work, however much she despises it, is the only route to the life of luxury she craves. Her gig as a nightclub singer in a glittery two-piece carries less dignity than Mildred’s waitressing shifts wearing plimsolls and a striped uniform, though it’s doubtful she understands that.

The framing story revolves around a murder, which opens the film by wrongfooting the audience. We are misled both about the culprit and the genre of the film that is to follow, as Mildred recounts her story in the police station. Curtiz keeps both genres in play throughout the film, finding ingenious ways to insert deep black shadows into homes and restaurants flooded with California sunshine.

Crawford’s years at MGM had schooled her well in the art of emoting in women’s pictures, but here her inner grit suits the crime-film aesthetic too. Mildred’s first appearance, striding down a neon-lit pier wearing a cantilevered fur coat, folds both styles into each other: as she arrives she is tearfully contemplating a watery suicide; when she leaves she is planning to cover up a felony. The murder was an addition to James M. Cain’s Depression-era source novel. In 1940s Hollywood, criminals needed to suffer the consequences of their actions – though you may wonder whether Mildred really deserves everything she gets. The final shots of the film seem to equate her return to her former life to a term of servitude, and domestic incarceration.

The 4K restoration does justice to this astonishing film, especially Ernest Haller’s sumptuous cinematography – there are almost as many bold crane shots as biting lines of dialogue to cherish here. In support of Crawford and Blyth, Arden is superb as Mildred’s colleague Ida, rendered bitter, unmarriageable and yet disarmingly witty after years of working for a living in the restaurant trade. Similarly, the performance by comic star Jack Carson, as seedy huckster Wally Fay, is far more memorable, and entertaining, than Mildred’s two adulterous husbands.
