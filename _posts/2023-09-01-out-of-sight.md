Like _Get Shorty_, _Out of Sight_ is adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel by Scott Frank and produced by Danny DeVito’s Jersey Films (and also features Dennis Farina in a bit part). But while _Get Shorty_’s director Barry Sonnenfeld played Leonard’s material as farce, Steven Soderbergh, in this infinitely more sophisticated follow-up, plays it as romantic comedy.

From Jack and Karen’s tantalising first encounter in a car boot, washed in the red of the brake lights, the film is fuelled by the sexual tension between the two leads, as opposed to any great suspense about who is going to end up with Ripley’s diamonds. Seizing their chance after too many bad films (the nadirs being _Batman and Robin_ for him, _Anaconda_ for her), George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez are both much more interesting and real here than they have been allowed to be in the past. With his slicked-back greying hair and bullish walk, Clooney’s Jack is all the cooler for being slightly seedy (in the book, Jack is in his late forties). But he’s also quite a poignant figure, aware of his shortcomings (‘Do you know anyone who’s done one last score and gone on to lead the good life?’ he wonders), while at the same time unable to resist overreaching himself. Meanwhile, despite her fabulous Bond-girl accoutrements (tight leather coat, shiny weapons), Lopez succeeds in humanising Karen. Her handgun, for instance, is·a gift from her doting father (Farina), and her verve as a law-enforcement officer is offset by her dawning realisation that she’d rather have an affair with Jack than send him to prison. The supporting characters, a feature of any Leonard adaptation, are equally engaging, notably Ving Rhames as Jack’s born-again Christian accomplice Buddy, who insists on confessing every job in advance to his sister; Steve Zahn as the feckless dopehead Glenn, in way over his head; and an uncredited Michael Keaton as Ray Nicolette, the same FBI agent he played in _Jackie Brown_.

The real star of _Out of Sight_, however, is director Steven Soderbergh. Previously feted for the intellectual rather than visual qualities of his films, he rises to the challenge of his most mainstream assignment to date with a dazzling display of hip cinematic style. His battery of freeze frames, jump cuts and zooms might seem irritating in less confident hands, but they flow perfectly in tandem with the wonderful, 70s-style score. The flashback-dependent plot structure might not seem radical in the wake of _Pulp Fiction_ or _Jackie Brown_, but, as he did with _The Underneath_, Soderbergh experiments with more short-term flashes back and forwards, to events only minutes in the past or future. Aided by veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, Soderbergh uses this intriguing technique to best effect during the tantalising sequence in a hotel bar where Karen and Jack finally come face to face. Their flirtation is intercut with what would conventionally be the next scene – making love in the hotel room – in a sly and strangely poignant reversal of the famous sex scene in _Don’t Look Now_ (1973). Another 30 years from now, Soderbergh’s sleight of hand may well seem as dated as _The Thomas Crown Affair_ (1968), but for the time being, it looks very good indeed.

**Screenwriter Scott Frank on ‘Out of Sight’**

_What does adapting [Elmore] Leonard involve?_

What I like about his books is that there’s a freedom to his writing, a real fluidity and sense of fun. I tend to overthink – I agonise over every word, and the punctuation. What I have to do is give structure to happenstance – he sits down and he doesn’t know where it’s headed, he just lets it unfold. He doesn’t think in terms of theme, so I find a theme, then anything that doesn’t play to that theme can fall away.

_What theme were you trying to bring out in_ Out of Sight _?_

It’s about the road not taken, which is the saddest thing. When I first wrote the screenplay the character was in his 50s – I thought of Robert De Niro or even Jack Nicholson. What’s so great about George Clooney’s performance is that he conveys that sadness: ‘If I hadn’t robbed all those banks, I could have been with this girl.’

_Do you usually have a cast in mind when you’re writing?_

The truth is I write everything for Steve McQueen, male and female. He’s the guy you wish you were.

_What did the two directors bring to your Leonard adaptations?_

I was on the set of _Wild, Wild West_ looking at video playback – uncut, unedited, just one camera take – and everything about it screamed Barry Sonnenfeld. On _Get Shorty_ I found Barry to be very funny and dark, he gets character nuance very well and he loves texture and detail. Steven Soderbergh has a dry sense of humour but he’s a much more romantic filmmaker, much more adult. Barry sees things in the material other people can’t – he has a unique way of visualising the world. Steven works from the inside out: he doesn’t start with the visualisation, he starts with the characters.

_Did he work closely with you when you were writing?_

Yes, because he’s a writer as well. He would come into the office, and if we had problems with a scene we’d discuss them, act it out, riff on dialogue. And we were always talking about _The Last Detail_, _The French Connection_. Those were our favourite sorts of films.

_How does the screenplay differ from the novel?_

The screenplay is more romantic, then when you realise the movie with George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez it gets more romantic still. There are bits that work better on screen than on the page, too, for instance in the dream – which is not in the novel – she walks into the bathroom, and when she grabs his hand she gives a little half-smile. All the emotion is contained in that tiny movement of her lips – it’s wonderful. And George Clooney has a great moment where he does a long monologue after they sleep together, and she says, ‘You’re not dumb,’ and he has this laugh when he says, ‘I don’t know about that.’ It’s a great moment of self-deprecation.
