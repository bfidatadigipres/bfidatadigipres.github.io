_Contains strong violence._

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

The young man whose aspirations to leave a criminal milieu are fatally trumped by his obligations to a wayward friend – it’s one of popular cinema’s most potent tragic narratives, a standard of Warner Bros melodrama successfully reworked by Martin Scorsese (_Mean Streets_), Wong Kar Wai (_As Tears Go By_) and Ernest Dickerson (_Juice_) among others. Each version offers the same combination of tempting violence – the easy release of the trigger – and the struggle for self-betterment, and contemporary London’s growing gun culture has regrettably made it a suitable setting for this latest take. Documentary maker Saul Dibb’s debut feature _Bullet Boy_ adheres to the core schema with perfunctory efficiency, charting Hackney youth Ricky’s release from jail and immediate reintroduction to the spiral of violence thanks to his inaptly named friend Wisdom. But if we’ve seen this story a dozen times before, it is devastatingly novel to Ricky’s 12-year-old brother Curtis, and the film’s success lies in the way it expresses the younger adolescent’s perspective on the events overtaking the elder.

There are only glancing references to the causes of Ricky’s imprisonment, or of the debt he owes to Wisdom. This clean approach arguably offers a blank narrative slate on to which Ricky’s escalating ordeals can be scrawled. The supporting cast helps foster a natural, unforced air that renders much of the action surprisingly affecting, from scenes of good-natured bickering to final leave-takings – notably the heartbreaking hesitancy with which, hours after banishing Ricky, his mother confirms his identity (and her loss). Ashley Walters brings considerable baggage to the lead role: as Asher D he was a key member of So Solid Crew, whose cutting-edge music and violent reputation placed it at the nexus of contemporary street culture, and has himself served time for possession of a firearm (some of it in the very cell seen here).

There is also power in the mock bucolic use of Hackney, with tower-high views of fields pocked with wrecked cars, a leafy canal in which a dead dog floats, a cow used for target practice. This perverted pastoral is the scene of Curtis’s youth, and his scenes are rich with dreamy, almost wondrous potential. The film opens on him stowed away in Wisdom’s car boot, the camera tight on his flashlit face, framed by his hood and the darkness, as if bearer of some ancient mystery. Similarly Curtis’ fetishisation of the gun is somehow more innocent that his brother’s, admiring its heft and form rather than its power and meaning until an initially frolicsome game of woodland hide-and-seek, shot in an artfully handhold style reminiscent of _Ratcatcher_, brings that childish fantasy to an end.

Always in uniform but seldom in school, Curtis wants goodness but is unconvinced by its supposed bearers: neither his teacher nor his mother’s lay preacher companion – both characterised sympathetically without wishy-washy or authoritarian caricature – seems to offer convincing alternatives to Ricky’s path. Luke Fraser gives the film’s most impressive performance, conveying the delicacy of Curtis’ multiple balancing acts with emotional force but no demand for sympathy: his love for Ricky borders on worship but is countered by the premium on machismo he increasingly apprehends as a challenge to both self-expression and self-preserving prudence. ‘I’d rather be a mummy’s boy than a crack-head’ runs his robust response to peer pressure from his mate Rio, although it’s unclear how long he can hold out. It’s a measure of the film’s sad sincerity that even as it ends with Curtis’ rejection of violence, his only binding tie seems to be a friendship already freighted with the kind of twisted obligation that does for his brother.
