**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Billy Wilder was often called cynical but compared to _Ace in the Hole_ the rest of his output is a mush-pot of human kindness. Possibly the sourest movie ever to come out of Hollywood, it stars Kirk Douglas at his most abrasive as Chuck Tatum, a reptilian Albuquerque reporter who happens across a guy trapped in an underground crevice and deliberately slows the rescue bid to make himself a bigger story. But it’s not just Tatum – everyone furthers their own ends at the expense of the poor dying bozo. Perhaps the script’s choicest line – which Wilder always credited to his wife Audrey – comes when the newsman suggests to the victim’s wife (trash-blonde Jan Sterling) that it might look good were she to invoke divine help. ‘I don’t go to church,’ she snarls. ‘Kneeling bags my nylons.’

_Ace_ was Wilder’s first film as his own producer, and his first major flop, with the critics and at the box office. Not surprisingly, perhaps; it savages not only the press but also the audience – depicting reporters as callous, mercenary fixers and the public as gullible sensation-seekers. Time has caught up with the movie: nowadays Tatum’s tactics would be seen as all too credible but at the time, as Wilder later acknowledged, ‘They didn’t believe me that when somebody’s a newspaperman, they are capable of that behaviour.’ Paramount, to Wilder’s annoyance, tried to salvage the film by retitling it  _The Big Carnival_. It didn’t help. Wilder is rarely thought of as a strongly visual director but, alongside its caustic human dynamic, _Ace_ impresses as spectacle. As the story, shrewdly manipulated by Tatum, spreads across the country, cars, trucks, trailers and specially laid-on trains disgorge hordes of rubberneckers. A carnival outfit – rather too nudgingly called the Great S&M Amusement Corporation – sets up shop and a glutinous theme song dedicated to the victim (‘We’re coming, we’re coming, Leo’) is endlessly blared out. From the high perspective of the cave entrance, Wilder’s camera surveys an ever-expanding ocean of morbid sentimentality.

**A contemporary review**  
In _Sunset Boulevard_ the Brackett-Wilder team took an outsize, legendary character, examined her coldly and ironically – but did not destroy her legendary quality. Billy Wilder, now on his own, does rather the same, in a very different setting, in the hard and brilliant _Ace in the Hole_. The larger-than-life character is Tatum; a rough, ruthless, hard-drinking, unscrupulous journalist reduced by a series of dismissals to the local paper in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he waits in growing desperation for the story which will restore his reputation.

It comes: Tatum is on the spot when a man is trapped in an old Indian mine after a cliff cave-in. With brutal precision the film examines the technique and apparatus of sensationalism. To spin out his story, Tatum bribes the corrupt, indolent sheriff into demanding a rescue method certain to take a week; he persuades the victim’s wife, Lorraine, a sullen, discontented blonde who has been waiting for a chance to escape, to play the sorrowing wife; he abandons his own paper for a New York daily. The crowds arrive; the ramshackle garage in the desert becomes the centre of an encampment of cars and tents; with them come the loudspeakers, endlessly playing a special song for the trapped man, the souvenir sellers, the carnival. The mood of the sensation seekers shifts from restless apathy to a more horrible vicarious excitement. Ironic and bitter contrasts are pointed between the dignity of the victim’s parents, his own acceptance of Tatum as a friend, and the shifty opportunism of the sheriff, Lorraine’s vicious boredom. The technique, in contrast to the leisurely, personal style of _Sunset Boulevard_, is one of impersonal, direct observation. The handling of the crowd compares interestingly with that employed on the rather similar occasion in _Fourteen Hours_. Wilder isolates individuals not in distracting asides from the main theme, but to provide an added, sharpened comment on the mass.

Parallel with this investigation runs that of Tatum himself, in his relations with the sheriff, with his editors, with Lorraine, who is played strikingly by Jan Sterling. Kirk Douglas’ brilliant performance, a more mature and harsh variation on the part played in _The Champion_, establishes Tatum’s driving force, his immense energy, his concentration. Neither it nor the script prepares us for the film’s conclusion.

After almost a week, with the drills still pounding at the rock, Tatum finds that the trapped man is dying, that the easy way of rescue has become impossible. In revulsion against what they have done he turns on Lorraine: there is a struggle in which she stabs him with her scissors. Tatum makes a last, futile effort at rescue; the man dies, and he dismisses the crowds. Then, the New York plans abandoned, he returns to the Albuquerque office, staggers in to tell his story, and falls dead. The ending is cleverly managed, and there is no surrender to sentiment (Wilder, indeed, is probably incapable of it) but it lacks the force of the logical, cruel conclusion, which demands that Tatum go through with his scheme.

The relative failure of the ending is an illustration of Wilder’s limitations. His is a talent which one respects rather than likes. This is not the result of his choice of subject, nor of his occasional tendency to vulgarity (_A Foreign Affair_) or to sensationalism for its own sake (_The Lost Weekend_); it is because he seems to lack the powers of analysis which his cold, observant style demands. It is the technique of a reporter, brilliantly conveying the immediate impact of a character or situation, less successful in developing it. A more human director, or a more skilful analyst, could have made more out of Tatum’s clash of conscience; Wilder is content to report it, as he reported Norma Desmond’s tragedy, and Tatum is credible as a character in the sense that Norma Desmond is credible – a gigantic figure who catches the imagination, so that one accepts him at his own valuation. But as writer (_Ace in the Hole_ is scripted by Wilder, Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman) and director Wilder has developed an exact, sardonic, objective style whose technical assurance carries him over passages where the quality of thought is unduly superficial. In _Ace in the Hole_ style and purpose achieve for the most part a fusion more impressive even than in _Sunset Boulevard_, and the result is perhaps his most remarkable film.
