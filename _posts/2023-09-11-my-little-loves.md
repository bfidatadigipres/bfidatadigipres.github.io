French artists seem peculiarly attracted to the mysteries of childhood and adolescence. In literature one thinks immediately of the luscious worlds conjured up by Proust and Alain-Fournier, in which characters are surrounded by a complex mesh of wistfully remembered sights, sounds and scents: in films, there is _Zéro de conduite_, _Les Jeux_ _interdits_, _Les Mistons_, _Mouchette_. Now Jean Eustache contributes his considerable pennyworth in _Mes petites amoureuses_, a film which has long been in mental preparation. The mammoth, bracing _La Maman et la putain_ reached the screen in advance purely because it could be made for much less money; following its success, the 2.5m francs needed to budget _Amoureuses_ finally became a concrete reality.

At a superficial glance, the film could be taken for a sad, nostalgic idyll: the opening sound is of Charles Trenet singing ‘Douce France’, and Nestor Almendros’ photography makes the song title seem perfectly apt. Village streets and neighbouring fields are dappled with sun and shadow; no rain cloud darkens the skies. The soundtrack is as full of open air as the images: crickets chirp, wind whistles through the trees. The story-line equally suggests a recognisable mood and pattern, with its young hero stumbling towards adulthood and sexual experience. Thirteen-year-old Daniel (Martin Loeb) moves from a happy village childhood (living with his grandmother) to a small town adolescence (living with his mother and her silent Spanish lover). His experiences with girls become bolder: from practical jokes (like firing a toy gun at their heads) he moves on to fondle them, kiss them, and eventually he lies down with a dark beauty in the long grass. At the end he returns to the country for a holiday; the girl he used to eye pushes his hands away from her breasts, and he joins his other friends romping innocently in the fields, feeling much older and wiser.

Under its beguilingly familiar surface, however, _Mes petites amoureuses_ remains as stern and uncompromising as its predecessor. France, in fact, is anything but _douce_, and Eustache dwells on the boredom rather than the excitement of adolescence, the desperate wanderings from diversion to diversion. And the diversions happen mechanically, almost without emotion: suddenly, and inexplicably, Daniel punches a schoolmate in the stomach and receives a blank look in return. When he enacts a circus trick before his pals (lying down, like the strong man, on broken glass), his audience only manage to look faintly bewildered. Once Daniel leaves for the town, life becomes even more desultory and the boy’s face assumes the set features of boredom. Deprived of schooling through insufficient funds, he idles away the hours ‘helping out’ in a cycle repair shop; outside work, he finds his pleasures visiting the cinemas (the town is blessed with four of them), strolling hopefully down an avenue traditionally set aside for pick-ups, lounging outside a café with fellow layabouts, swapping cigarette packets and stories of sexual exploits. The exploits themselves are passionless, interrupted affairs; for full-blooded romance we have to turn to the films Daniel sees, such as Albert Lewin’s _Pandora and the Flying Dutchman_, where Ava Gardner disports herself in a series of dizzily bizarre images.

Eustache’s directorial style emphasises the bleak daily round of his hero. The narrative proceeds through a succession of short scenes separated by quick black fades, pin-pointing confrontations and gestures with Bressonian force (though the style also attractively points up the humour inherent in much of the material – as with Daniel’s circus trick). The elliptical approach serves a further purpose by focusing on the random comings and goings of the community; people unhurriedly walk by, meet and pass on – a kaleidoscope which conveys the atmosphere of Daniel’s environment without any recourse to heavy local colouring. This slow-motion choreography of characters works most remarkably in the climactic scenes, when Daniel and a friend leave their comrades to pursue two village girls along a country road, only to be pursued in turn by the friends they left behind. With the minimum of dialogue, a battle of rival courtships ensues, riveting in its truthfulness and lack of rhetoric. Yet Eustache doesn’t always maintain such a firm grip on events, his obvious identification with Daniel leading him to harp on the boy’s listless manner a little too heavily at times, with the result that the audience sometimes experiences a twinge of listlessness itself. But on balance _Mes petites_ _amoureuses_ offers a distinctly cool, delicately nuanced study of a human being undergoing that strange process called ‘growing up’.
