_+ Q&A with Shane Meadows and producer Mark Herbert_

_Contains strong violence and sexual violence._

Nineteen years since its original release, Shane Meadows’ startling fourth feature has lost none of its power. Paddy Considine is compelling as Richard, a haunted ex-soldier who returns to the place he grew up. Disaffected, lost and troubled by the past, he is a powder-keg of untrammelled male rage and an as yet unrealised threat to a group of men whose past is entwined with his.  
**bfi.org.uk**  

‘Are you the devil?’ a dope-addled drug dealer asks the avenging angel ex-soldier in _Dead Man’s Shoes_, the latest genre-straddling experiment from homegrown indie king Shane Meadows. Certainly there is something demonic about the spectre of a killer who torments his victims by making them dance like puppets before methodically dispatching them with cold calculation. The otherworldly nature of the question also hints at the hidden heart of a story in which long buried secrets return from the grave to haunt the guilty. Yet the tone of _Dead Man’s Shoes_ remains resolutely down-to-earth in its blend of grim social realism and edgy rural satire, creating a hybrid of horror, comedy and latter-day Western in its story of a mysterious loner with one foot in the grave who forces a blandly familiar Midlands village to acknowledge a silenced history of abuse.

The crossing of generic boundaries is business as usual for Meadows, whose nominally comedic back catalogue has long harboured dark delights. His last film, _Once upon a Time in the Midlands_ (2002), began life as a melancholy riff on the Western legend of the ‘Man with No Name’ before gradually mutating into a quirky romantic comedy packed with eccentric country-and-western cameos. By contrast, _Dead Man’s Shoes_ was conceived as a farcical romp but slowly festered into something more bloody minded. But whilst _Once upon a Time in the Midlands_ ultimately proved an unsatisfyingly disjointed affair, _Dead Man’s Shoes_ is a terrifically cohesive exercise whose stripped down guerrilla-style production perfectly matches the raw appeal of the story. Apparently unencumbered by the need to satisfy a wide audience, Meadows returns to his roots with a punchy, confrontational and distinctively personal drama that takes a refreshingly unapologetic approach to the taboo subject of revenge.

Taking inspiration from such disreputable 1970s classics as _Death Wish_, _Deliverance_ and _Straw Dogs_, _Dead Man’s Shoes_ is notable for the unironic tone of its eye-for-an-eye ethos. Despite the black humour of early scenes, there is little to laugh at in the grisly catalogue of do-it-yourself justice that ensues. On the contrary, Meadows and star/co-writer Paddy Considine seem to take very straight-faced pleasure in the axings, stabbings and dismemberments that constitute the film’s trail of blood, inventively shed with such innocuous domestic objects as a kettle, a toilet and a surprisingly spacious suitcase. Meadows has said ‘I’m not a violent man, but at the end of the day the characters who get killed in _Dead Man’s Shoes_ are based on people that I want to kill.’ The admission chimes with the film’s tone: sympathy for drug dealers is in short supply and guilty audience pleasures are duly rewarded.

This alarming political incorrectness reaps cinematic dividends, lending the drama a cutting edge that undermines any sense of cosy familiarity and keeps us in a state of anxious unease. Considine is particularly adept at navigating the fine line between humour and horror, the soft burr of his voice and inquisitive set of his features giving way to a demeanour bespeaking genuine threat. _Dead Man’s Shoes_ ends on a note of tragic redemption that both accepts the self-destructive futility of vengeance and maintains its mephitic spell; a characteristically deft sleight of hand from its unruly creators.
