**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_Contains strong violence._

_Sweet Sixteen_ is sure to be written off in some quarters as Ken Loach beating the same old drum, and that’s perfectly true. The movie is so classical an instance of his committed realist cinema that it’s practically a curriculum vitae. Economy is destiny as always, but the grim determinism in the atmosphere chiefly recalls _My Name Is Joe_ (1998), with its context of chronic mass employment and its ear-straining Scottish idiom. ‘Every fuckin’ choice stinks doon here,’ Joe cried out in anguish at his ruined dreams, and it isn’t hard to imagine that Liam, the aspiring hero of _Sweet Sixteen_, exhibits Loach’s archetypal proletarian at an earlier stage, before the bitter lesson has quite sunk in (screenwriter Paul Laverty indeed proposes the film as a sort of prequel to _Joe_). While he’s less sensitive and far more pragmatic, fifteen-year-old Liam also naturally conjures up Billy in _Kes_ (1969), capable of finer things but hamstrung from the start. Billy’s taming of the kestrel connotes a human potential beyond his preordained drudgery in the coal pit, and Liam has an iconic object too. The riverside caravan where he plans to live with his shiftless mother lean is the street kid’s version of an Arcadian idyll – plentiful fishing and plastic flowers on the doorway. In either case, it’s the merest glimpse of freedom, for the iron laws of necessity soon kick in to extinguish all hope.

Those who want British cinema to be light and fluffy have sometimes accused Loach of defeatism and complained that his working-class tragedies are rigged by melodramatic plotting. No doubt; yet from Zola to _Bicycle Thieves_, a long tradition links melodrama with realism. The coincidences and chance encounters in one (Liam finances the caravan through drug dealing until he sets foot on the wrong council estate) add up to a nemesis that conveniently doubles for the oppressive social structures in the other. A certain lack of novelty is the price Loach pays for his conviction that human misery is systemic. The basic rules of capitalism haven’t changed, and he keeps plugging away at that unfashionable truth for the few who care to listen. In line with the most durable Marxist aesthetic, Loach and his writers seek out protagonists whose experiences are typical – not one-off overachievers like Billy Elliot – to feed the audience’s syrupy fantasies, but the ordinary Joes and Liams trying to scrape together a decent life. While the method risks abstraction (as in _Bread and Roses_, where the people are agitprop mannequins representing the class struggle), it more often results in characters who feel rounded and concrete. With a touch of the 19-century realist, Loach steers a middle course between the particular and the universal, specifying psychological traits, yet refracting them through wider processes and institutions. You get a sharp sense of the emotional dialectic binding Liam and his mother – how her benign neglect spurs him on to ever greater possessiveness and need. At the same time, it’s clear that the rootlessness motivating both in contradictory ways is their inevitable portion as the losers of history.

The dovetailing of the personal and the political can seem a little neat, which is to say that Loach’s characters are short on mystery. There’s never an impression of something left over that surpasses the understanding – Loach is too commonsensical and English to have truck with that brand of cosmic malarky. In the final scene, Liam gazes out over the river and faces his future like Antoine in _Les Quatre cents coups_. The difference is that for Liam the writing is emphatically on the wall. When the highest legitimate goal we hear about is a part-time job at a call centre, it isn’t remarkable that he should be embarking on a career as a petty gangster. Laverty’s script plus some cunning details in the _mise en scène_ enable us to see the solid advantages of crime for the culturally dispossessed – not only the flashy cars and smart clothes, but behind them such spiritual goods as security, status, companionship and even self-esteem. Strangely, the total absence of ambiguity doesn’t make the film less affecting, but more so. Like _Joe_ or _Ladybird Ladybird_ (1994), _Sweet Sixteen_ can induce scalding tears because it offers a plain and inescapable perception of how material force operates to maim the soul of the individual. None of that would be possible, of course, without the observational skills Loach has been honing for close to four decades. By now, the illusion is complete, we are simply eavesdropping on these damaged lives, the camera appearing to follow rather than lead. Loach gives his people space, which renders their chains all the more unbearably poignant.
