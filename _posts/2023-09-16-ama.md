_+ intro by His Excellency Papa Owusu-Ankomah, Ghana’s High Commissioner and Q&A with actor Georgina Ackerman and director Kwesi Owusu hosted by film lecturer, Imruh Bakari_

On its first release, _Ama: An African Voyage of Discovery_ received a British television screening on Monday 31 August 1992. A masterstroke of scheduling, as this particular Monday also marked the last day of the iconic Notting Hill carnival, bringing the long weekend of the bank holiday event to a close. With wide critical acclaim, the film also had a brief cinema release in the UK, and successful screenings in Ghana and at international film festivals.

Just over three decades later, a re-versioned ‘director’s cut’ has now been released, with a premiere screening at the New York African Film Festival on Friday 26 May 2023. With the central theme of a Ghanaian family in London being forced to confront their sense of longing for home, the film triumphs because of its timeless message. The drama unfolds around Ama (Georgina Ackerman), a 12-year-old London girl, who is taken on a day trip to an English countryside lake.

Across the years of his migrant life in London, Ama’s father, Kwame (Thomas Baptiste), had developed an attachment to the chosen spot. Now retired, he and his family are on another visit. Babs, as his wife Corni (Anima Misa) calls him, is in a reflective mood, whilst she wishes that the surrounding tranquillity would endure beyond the moment.

The younger children wander off, and Ama more so, as she takes her own path into an enchanted clearing in the woods populated with African artefacts, images and sounds. It is here that she finds a leather pouch containing what she later realises is a computer floppy disc. As the family returns to their London home, this pouch and its contents will bring a special meaning to Ama’s presence in the family. This is a family struggling to maintain an impression of middle-class life. Preoccupied with keeping up appearances, and Kwame’s ailing condition, Corni has to take up an office-cleaning job.

On one shift, Ama accompanies her mother and discovers in the office items that suggest what is in the mysterious pouch she carries around her neck. It is a floppy disc which works when she inserts it into one of the office computers. Prompted and following its instructions, the disc reveals data and information which empowers Ama, in her innocence, as a kind of ancestral messenger. As the drama unfolds, admonitions and information find release through Ama. This is occurring as the family’s ancestral secrets try to force their way into the open. This does not help her father’s condition, as he stubbornly resists advice and invitations to return to Ghana.

The idea of home is at the core of the story. Very present in the lives of Ama’s father and mother, is a sense of loss and longing. So too, are the ways in which, in the wider community, home is created and invoked through cultural practices, rituals of performance, and social gatherings. Particularly evident in the soundtrack is the way in which the styles and lyricism, from Aladura spirituality to Kpanlogo, Reggae and Hip-Hop, bring alive timeless myths and memories.

Following the death of her father, Ama’s journey takes her on a path, seemingly beyond the reach of her family, towards reconnecting with her ancestral lineage. Symbolically, strange appearances and disappearances eventually lead Ama’s mother, Corni, and aunt, Sister Mabel (Alexandra Duah), into the arena of the carnival. In masquerade costume, and searching for Ama, Corni moves along with the carnival band as if intoxicated with a mixture of joy and loss.

The contemporary significance of _Ama: An African Voyage of Discovery_ is that it depicts the ordinary ways in which a migrant family struggles with the inner and outer experiences of daily life and generational anxieties. The conflicts that permeate, remain very much alive as new waves of diaspora continue to be produced by ongoing global migrations.
