Danny Dyer’s career has been nothing if not eclectic, beginning his career under the guidance of playwright Harold Pinter. His breakout role in _Human Traffic_ catapulted him into the limelight, making him the poster boy for youthful hedonism in the early 2000s. Dyer’s subsequent role as landlord Mick Carter in _EastEnders_ has secured him national-treasure status. Season curator Nia Childs chats with him about his wide-ranging career.

Danny Dyer was discovered at a local school by an agent, who auditioned him for the part of Martin Fletcher in the Granada Television series _Prime Suspect 3_ (1993), beginning his acting career at 16. He also appeared on television in episodes of _Cadfael_ (1994), _A Touch of Frost_ (1995), _Loved Up_ (1995), _Thief Takers_ (1996), _Highlander_ and _Soldier Soldier_ (both 1997), _Second Generation_ (2003), _Skins_, _Hotel Babylon_, and _Breathless_ (renamed first _Blood Rush_ and then _Kiss of Death_).

Dyer’s first film role was in _Human Traffic_ (1999). His subsequent movie work includes Mel Smith’s _High Heels and Low Lifes_ (2001) and starring roles in _Borstal Boy_ (2000), _Mean Machine_ (2002) and in four films by the British film director Nick Love: _Goodbye Charlie Bright_ (2001); _The Football Factory_ (2004); _The Business_ (2005); and _Outlaw_ (2007). Among other film roles, he also appeared as the character Steve in Christopher Smith’s _Severance_ (2006); as Hayden in _Adulthood_ (2008); and as himself in the feature documentary _Tattoos: A Scarred History_.

Beginning in 2007, Dyer became the presenter of _The Real Football Factories_ and _The Real Football Factories International_, a TV documentary series on Bravo, in which he travelled throughout the UK and in the latter throughout the world, to meet and interview football club fans and hooligans. _Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men_, ‘a gritty and hard-hitting documentary series that sees him venturing into the dark depths of the British underworld and hunting down some of the most notorious and feared men in Britain today’, began airing on Bravo in the UK on 20 October 2008.

In 2008, he finished filming his roles as Pete and Tom in _City Rats_ and _7 Lives_, respectively. In 2009, Dyer completed filming on _Jack Said_, a Brit noir thriller in which he played Nathan alongside Ashlie Walker, Terry Stone, David O’Hara and Simon Phillips. This film is the prequel to _Jack Says_, which was released in 2008, and starred Mike Reid.

In 2009, he shot several horror films, including _Doghouse_, under the direction of Jake West, and _Basement_ under the direction of Asham Kamboj. He played one of the lead roles in the British vampire film _Dead Cert_. In June 2010, he was cast for the lead role in the remake of the British horror film _The Asphyx_, but it failed to secure production finance and was indefinitely shelved. Dyer co-starred with Anna Walton in _Deviation_, a British dark thriller written and directed by J. K. Amalou. In 2012, Dyer played the lead role in Ray Cooney’s _Run for Your Wife_.

In February 2012, Dyer appeared as a paramedic in an episode of _Casualty_. Dyer appeared in the sixth series of _Hollyoaks Later_ in October 2013, as The White Man. On 1 October 2013, the BBC announced that Dyer had been cast in _EastEnders_ as Mick Carter, the new landlord of The Queen Victoria pub, a role he played until January 2022. He won the Serial Drama Performance award at the National Television Awards in 2015, 2016, and 2019.

In August 2018, Dyer began narrating MTV reality series, _True Love or True Lies_. In 2019, Dyer appeared in a history documentary, titled _Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family_. The two-part series premiered on BBC One on 23 January 2019. Also that year, Dyer co-presented _True Love or True Lies_ on MTV alongside daughter Dani, as well as beginning his presenting role on _The Wall_ on BBC One. After he announced his departure from _EastEnders,_ it was subsequently confirmed that Dyer would also be leaving _The Wall._

Dyer has performed on stage, most notably in two plays written and directed by 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter: as the Waiter in the London première of _Celebration_ (2000), at the Almeida Theatre, which transferred to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in New York, as part of the Harold Pinter Festival held there in July and August 2001; and as Foster in the revival of _No Man’s Land_ (1975), at the Royal National Theatre, in London, during 2001 and 2002. In March 2008, he played Joey in a revival of Pinter’s _The Homecoming_ (1964), directed by Michael Attenborough, at the Almeida Theatre, in London. He also performed in Peter Gill’s play _Certain Young Men_ (1999) in London. From 9 September 2009 to 3 October 2009, Dyer appeared as Sid Vicious in a new play called _Kurt and Sid_ in London’s West End at the Trafalgar Studios.
