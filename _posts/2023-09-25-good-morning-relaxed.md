_+ intro and discussion_

Following the popular Relaxed Screenings as part of our Kurosawa season, we return to Japan with a link to this month’s Ozu programme. 

The director’s pared-back aesthetic proves perfect for drawing out comedy in this family drama. _Good Morning_ is a playful look at communication, within families, with neighbours and between children, as a way of exploring how social conventions influence individual and societal perspectives. It’s a hugely enjoyable snapshot of Japan at the end of the 1950s.

The post screening discussion with be co-hosted by campaigner and creative Leo Capella with Ozu season curator Ian Haydn Smith.
