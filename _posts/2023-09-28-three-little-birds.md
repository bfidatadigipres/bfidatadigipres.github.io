_+ Q&A with Sir Lenny Henry and directors Charles McDougall and Yero Timi-Biu and composer Benjamin Kwasi Burrell, hosted by Miquita Oliver._

Spirited, moving, funny and utterly heartfelt, _Three Little Birds_ is a triumphant celebration of immigration, community and the strength of Black womanhood inspired by the life-affirming stories of Sir Lenny Henry’s mother and all those who have travelled to make Britain their home.

Set in 1957, post-Windrush, and amidst the booming decade set alight by promise, the rhythm of rock and roll, swing, Hollywood starlets and fabulous fashion, _Three Little Birds_ will introduce Dudley and the rest of the world to gregarious sisters Leah (Rochelle Neil) and Chantrelle (Saffron Coomber) and their virtuous, bible-loving acquaintance, Hosanna (Yazmin Belo), as they board a cruise ship from Jamaica bound for a new life in Blighty.

Lured to the UK in search of new beginnings and by their older brother Aston (Javone Prince), who asks Leah and Chantrelle if they’ll bring him a potential wife from back home, they convince Hosanna to give up her job as a trainee nurse and embark upon the journey to ‘the mother country’. An effervescent mix of strong personalities, they all have very different reasons for leaving their family and friends behind in Clarendon, Jamaica, though they soon discover it’s not all it’s cracked up to be, not least the dramatic change in weather. While we learn shocking truths about the lives they left behind, the voyage of discovery is not smooth sailing for our trio, but they are determined to succeed and overcome the many obstacles of integration and build a new life in Britain.

**About the panel**

**Sir Lenny Henry** has been a performer since the age of 16. He has risen from being a cult star on children’s television to becoming one of Britain’s best known comedians, as well as a writer, philanthropist and award-winning actor.

In recent years Lenny’s stage acting has earned him huge critical acclaim. He made his stage acting debut in 2009 in the lead role of Northern Broadsides’ production of _Othello_ at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which later transferred to the West End. He has since starred in _The Comedy of Errors_ at The National, _Fences_ at the Duchess Theatre, _The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui_ at the Donmar Warehouse, and _King Hedley II_ at Theatre Royal, Stratford East.

Lenny’s TV acting credits include _Broadchurch_, _The Syndicate_, _The Long Song_ and the biographic film _Danny and the Human Zoo_. Lenny’s production company, Douglas Road, has achieved success in partnership with Burning Bright on the acclaimed documentary _The Commonwealth Kid_.

As a co-founder of Comic Relief Lenny was delighted to announce this year that the British public has donated over £1billion to Comic Relief over the last 30 years. Lenny is a strong advocate for diversity, using his voice to give talks on the subject all over the world. He has been a Trustee of the National Theatre since February 2016 and was awarded a Knighthood in 2015 for services to drama and charity.

In 2018, BBC One broadcast _The Lenny Henry Birthday Show_, looking back on Lenny’s career to commemorate his 60th birthday. In autumn 2019 Faber published the first volume of his memoir _Who Am I, Again?_, around which he wrote a live show that toured the UK for two months. 2020 saw further book commissions with part two of his memoir _Rising to the Surface_, two books on the topic of diversity, and a series of children’s books published through Pan Macmillan.

In 2022 Lenny was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Television Awards. He also appeared as the hobbit Sadoc in Amazon’s _Lord of the Rings_ prequel _The Rings of Power_ and as Balor in the Netflix series _The Witcher: Blood Origin_.

In spring 2023 Lenny starred in his self-penned play _August in England_, which received critical acclaim during its run at London’s Bush Theatre. His stage writing debut has earned him a nomination in the Best Writer category of The Stage Debut Awards.

October sees the publication of Lenny’s latest children’s book _The Boy with Wings: Clash of the Superkids_ and the transmission of his long-awaited six-part television drama, _Three Little Birds_, on ITV. The historical drama is inspired by his mother’s stories about leaving Jamaica in the 1950s for Great Britain. The same month ITV1 will broadcast a one-hour documentary, _Lenny Henry: One of a Kind_ which sees Lenny looking back on his time in the entertainment spotlight with tributes from both famous faces and his family and friends.

Yero also has her own original shows and book adaptations in development with various indies, streamers, and broadcasters internationally.

In 2019 he was the recipient of the Musical Director Recognition Award at the inaugural Black British Theatre Awards.

Since 2019, Benjamin has been the musical director of The House and Garage Orchestra and in 2021 he lent his music expertise to help co-ordinate the live celebration Coventry Moves Together for UK City of Culture 2021, which saw the people of Coventry tuning in via radio, online, and over social media at home for a city-wide, shared music experience. His work can be experienced in the biographical _Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical_ at the Lyric Theatre, following the renowned reggae singer’s journey from his roots in Jamaica to international stardom.
