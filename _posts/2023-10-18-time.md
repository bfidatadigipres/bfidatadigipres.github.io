_+ Q&A with writers Jimmy McGovern and Helen Black, actors Jodie Whittaker, Bella Ramsey and director Andrea Harkin_

Told through the lens of three very different inmates, _Time_ is a moving and high-stakes portrayal of life inside a women’s prison. Arriving at Carlingford Prison on the same day, Orla (Jodie Whittaker), Abi (Tamara Lawrance) and Kelsey (Bella Ramsey) are thrown together to face an unfamiliar world. But even with the ever-present threat of violence within its walls, they discover that an unexpected sense of community, and a shared understanding, still might be possible.

In 1982, screenwriter and producer **Jimmy McGovern** started his TV career working on Channel 4’s soap opera _Brookside_. He tackled many social issues in the course of the series, especially unemployment – which was at a post-war high at the time. In 1993, he created the drama serial _Cracker_, about the work of a fictional criminal psychologist played by Robbie Coltrane. Made by Granada Television and screened on ITV, the series was a critical and popular success, lasting until 1995. McGovern’s writing earned him two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. In 1997 he created _The Lakes_, a drama that shared _Brookside_’s realist setting and reused themes from _Cracker_, such as gambling addiction. In 2006, he created the BBC One drama _The Street_; its third and final series aired in 2009.

McGovern also wrote the script for the television docudrama _Hillsborough_ (1996), based on the events of the stadium disaster in 1989. Among the cast of this drama was Christopher Eccleston along with former _Brookside_ actor Ricky Tomlinson. Eccleston later said it was the most important work he’d ever done.

In 2009, McGovern was the executive producer on the BBC One miniseries _Moving On_. His series _Accused_ aired from 2010 to 2012 on BBC One. It followed a similar format to _The Street_ but with a crime component.

In 2012, McGovern and local Indigenous Australian writers from Sydney developed the Australian television drama series _Redfern Now_, set among the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney suburb of Redfern. In June 2021, McGovern’s series _Time_, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham, aired on BBC One. The series was directed by Lewis Arnold. It won the BAFTA for best miniseries in 2022.

Jimmy was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Television Society in March 2018
