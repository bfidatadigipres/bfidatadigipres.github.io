It’s still the same old story. [Over] 75 years after it was released, _Casablanca_ remains one of the world’s best-loved films. Not just the best-loved, but best-remembered. Many cinephiles can quote large chunks of the dialogue by heart, and _Casablanca_ has the most entries of any film in the American Film Institute’s 100 Greatest Movie Quotes of All Time list.

Even people who have never seen Michael Curtiz’s romantic wartime allegory can conjure up a few lines about beautiful friendships, gin joints and hills of beans… maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

Why is _Casablanca_ such a quotable film? Well, it doesn’t hurt that the characters themselves use quotation and memory to negotiate their heartbreak. _Casablanca_ is about a love affair in the past tense.

During the course of the film, Humphrey Bogart’s Rick says ‘Here’s looking at you, kid’ to Ingrid Bergman’s Ilsa four times, and what was once a jovial toast becomes a poignant farewell. When Rick and Ilsa agree that they’ll ‘always have Paris’ they’re saying that the memory of a happy romance will sustain them through the pain of separation.

Most famously of all, the separate lovers test their own fortitude by forcing themselves to listen to the song, and the lyrics, that scored their prior happiness. That’s ‘As Time Goes By’, a song that insists on the enduring power of love, and its attendant woes: jealousy, hate and tragedy. ‘A fight for love and glory/A case of do or die.’

Rick and Ilsa were listening to ‘As Time Goes By’ in Paris during the summer of 1940, 18 months before we meet them. The song itself was already nearly ten years old by then. It was written for a Broadway musical called _Everybody’s Welcome_ in 1931. Sam (played by Dooley Wilson, a bandleader in the 1920s) plays a collection of old songs in Rick’s bar, including 1924’s ‘It Had to Be You’. M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl’s sassy ‘Knock on Wood’ is the film’s only original tune.

Rick and Ilsa may reignite their romance in _Casablanca_, but, as in Victor and Ilsa’s first marriage, they keep their feelings hidden. Too much passion would be dangerous in the world of _Casablanca_, whose world of cool glamour is defined by understatement and other rhetorical games. Here, the Second World War is played out among polite people in a cocktail bar, where Rick’s avowed neutrality sets the tone. Rick and Ilsa remain calm under the threat of bombardment in Paris while finishing their champagne.

Although he declares himself impartial, Louis Renault (Claude Rains) asserts his authority and keeps the horrors of the hour away with his sardonic wit, offending the Germans by emphasising ‘Third Reich’ in a way that suggests there will be another.

Likewise, Victor (Paul Henreid), Ilsa’s resistance leader husband, ironically describes German citizenship as a ‘privilege’ but says his time in a Nazi concentration camp was ‘honour enough’. No word is wasted in this trim script, which weaponises language. The characters’ combination of deadpan comedy and modesty represents their bravery too – it’s an aspirational mode of dialogue, in which cleverness, and perhaps a little cynicism, trumps fear and untrammelled emotion. When we borrow _Casablanca_’s dialogue, we borrow a little of their grace under fire, and suggest we too could be noble enough to sacrifice our own interests for the greater good.

Quotations from _Casablanca_ appear everywhere from TV adverts to other films, right up to recent releases _Allied_ (2016) and _Atomic_ _Blonde_ (2017). The film has been parodied by everyone from the Marx Brothers to Bugs Bunny. Paul Anton Smith’s compilation film _Have You Seen My Movie?_ (2016) splices together several scenes from other films in which characters watch the final scene. Karina Longworth’s unmissable Hollywood history podcast takes its title,  You Must Remember This, from a line in ‘As Time Goes By’, and each episode is introduced by the haunting sound of Bergman humming the melody.

Woody Allen sampled the entire movie in a 1969 play, filmed by Herbert Ross in 1972, although the title – _Play It Again, Sam_ – is famously a mangled misquotation of what Rick actually says to his pianist. Bryan Singer’s 1995 thriller _The Usual Suspects_ took its title from one of Renault’s lines. Emma Stone’s Mia in _La La Land_ (2016) is obsessed with the film, sleeping underneath a giant poster of Bergman and working opposite one of its key shooting locations – which suggests a grim prognosis for her fling with Ryan Gosling’s Sebastian.

Bergman said of the film that ‘it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled.’ The film’s popularity has only grown, and it seems we still need the spirit of _Casablanca_. In November 2016, after the terrorist attacks in Paris, thousands shared a clip from _Casablanca_ online. It was the scene in which the patrons of Rick’s café begin singing the Marseillaise in unison to drown out the Nazis. In a time of trouble, with hate on the rise in Europe, many people found that the defiance of these glamorous refugees in a septuagenarian movie said everything that they needed to say.  
**Pamela Hutchinson, bfi.org.uk, 30 November 2017**  

How many different drinks does Laszlo (Paul Henreid) order in _Casablanca_? Even the 90 per cent of the population who must feel they know the film’s dialogue by heart might be foxed by that one. The answer, it appears, is four: Cointreau, a cocktail, cognac and whisky. The information comes from an essay on _Casablanca_ and the cult film by Umberto Eco. The explanation, Eco suggests, is not that Laszlo was an eclectic drinker, or that scriptwriters can be forgivably lackadaisical on such fine points, but that Michael Curtiz ‘was simply quoting, unconsciously, similar situations in other movies and trying to provide a reasonably complete repetition of them.’

I don’t think I believe this. But Eco on _Casablanca_ is worth seeking out (the essay is in a collection called _Travels in Hyperreality_, Secker and Warburg, 1986). His view of cult films is that they should not ‘reveal a coherent philosophy of composition’ but actually benefit from something rickety in the construction – as in _Casablanca_, where no one knew how the story was going to end. ‘One must be able to break, dislocate, unhinge it, so that one can remember only parts of it, irrespective of their original relationship with the whole.’ The _Casablanca_ authors ‘mixed a little of everything, and everything they chose came from a repertoire that had stood the test of time ... To make a good story, a single archetype is usually enough. But _Casablanca_ is not satisfied with that. It uses them all.’

All the archetypes, says Eco, can be found in the film’s first 20 minutes, and he reels off a splendid list, from Casablanca as the Magic Door to the Promised Land, of course requiring the Magic Key (the transit letters) to ‘The Faithful Servant and the Beloved Master, Don Quixote and Sancho’ and ‘Play it (again Sam). Anticipated quotation of Woody Allen.’ ‘Two clichés make us laugh but a hundred move us, because we sense dimly that the clichés are talking among themselves, celebrating a reunion.’

The essence is that _Casablanca_ became a cult film because it never set out to be one. Quotations self-consciously used in modern movies ‘born in order to become cult objects’ are quite another matter. ‘Spielberg and Lucas are semiotically nourished authors working for a culture of instinctive semioticians.’ Eco ends his urbane essay: ‘It will be a sad day when a too smart audience will read _Casablanca_ as conceived by Michael Curtiz after having read Calvino and Barthes. But that day will come. Perhaps we have been able to discover here, for the last time, the Truth...’
