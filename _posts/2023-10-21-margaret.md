**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

During one of the blistering wars of words that are _Margaret_’s lifeblood, a character issues the sour reprimand: ‘Don’t handle me.’ Perhaps no film in recent memory can claim to have been ‘handled’ more than Kenneth Lonergan’s long delayed, much tinkered-with New York saga, which at last emerges following a traumatic six years of about turns, back and forth lawsuits and protracted surgery from a queue of edit doctors. The version that now sees the light of day, pruned to a studio-stipulated 150 minutes after a final polish by Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker, is as electrifying as it is occasionally wearying.

Shot in 2005, _Margaret_ is a palpable artefact of Bush-era America, its study of thwarted ideals and fateful solipsism unfolding in a city still in gradual recovery from epochal tragedy. From the arresting opening shots of packed throngs of Manhattanites strolling in ultra slow motion, the air is fraught, the tone brittle. Soon enough, Upper West Side teenager Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin) playfully distracts a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo) to such an extent that he skips a red light and runs over a pedestrian. In a painfully vivid sequence, the woman dies in Lisa’s arms; confused and feeling pangs of responsibility, Lisa lies to the police that the light was green, absolving the driver – who sheepishly reaffirms her statement – of blame. Lonergan proceeds from this tortuous poser (who exactly is culpable?) by giving Lisa a burning interior conflict that has ultimately far-reaching consequences. Her gnawing urge to talk about the accident’s ramifications is kept frustratingly unfulfilled: her single mother Joan (an excellent J. Smith-Cameron), a stage actress, is too busy with her imminent Broadway opening; her preoccupied father relays vague advice down the phone from California. The most attentive listener is Matt Damon’s sincere but naive geometry teacher, with whom Lisa ill-advisedly begins a flirtation.

Brilliantly played by Paquin, Lisa is a terrific, maddening creation – prickly and defensive, headstrong but vulnerable. When she tries to find someone, or something, to blame for the accident beside herself, her misguided idealism takes a battering from the grey moral compromises of adult reality. ‘I don’t want to make this my own moral gymnasium,’ she says, quoting Bernard Shaw. As written by Lonergan, it’s an assault course. The elusiveness of doing the right thing equally suffused Lonergan’s debut _You Can Count on Me_ (2000), but compared with that film’s subtle evasions, _Margaret_ is unapologetically bold. The messy, prolonged rows between people blue in the face from being misunderstood or failing to communicate recall Cassavetes, but there’s a heightened, sometimes theatrical quality to Lonergan’s bracing dialogue. Opera and literature are knowingly alluded to. _Margaret_’s title derives from Gerard Manley Hopkins’s poem ‘Spring and Fall’ (recited, along with pointed excerpts from _King Lear_, by Matthew Broderick’s English professor), detailing a girl’s loss of innocence when faced with grief and the darkness in the world at large. It’s a rather blunt literary proxy for Lisa, but it might also double for New York itself post-2001. A potent sense of performance lingers: glimpses of Joan’s stage career; Lisa’s acrimonious school debates where students scream at each other about 9/11 and Afghanistan; Joan’s numerous opera visits with her would-be suitor Ramon (Jean Reno).

_Margaret_’s most extraordinary scene – a tearful reconciliation during a performance of _The Tales of Hoffmann_ – might easily have been risibly phoney, but I found it totally apposite to the film’s singular dramatic register. There are intermittent signs of production travails – certain scenes are a little broken-backed or overly baggy, subplots can feel half-developed, and some characters seem to have lost major screen time (Damon especially). Nevertheless, in its present form, Lonergan’s magnum opus is an engrossing sprawl – a resonant work of novelistic breadth and often scalding power.  
**Matthew Taylor, _Sight and Sound_, February 2012**

On 30 September 2011, six years after shooting started, Kenneth Lonergan’s _Margaret_ opened in 12 US cities. It played for all of five weeks, and grossed $46,495 in return for its $12.4 million budget. _Margaret_ is 150 minutes of remarkable storytelling in which every character has equally compelling and (in)defensible reasons for their actions. Unfortunately the lawsuits arising out of the making of _Margaret_ – arguably as complicated as those depicted on screen – dominated the critical reception of Lonergan’s film.

For _Margaret_, Lonergan secured editorial carte blanche from co-financiers Gary Gilbert’s Camelot Pictures and Fox Searchlight. With one caveat: the final cut couldn’t exceed two hours. As a rule of thumb, one page of script equates to one minute of screen time; Mark Ruffalo claims the original script was 186 pages, while actress Olivia Thirlby says 300 pages were filmed during a three-month shoot that started in September 2005. Whatever the length of the script, even when Lonergan’s contract was renegotiated to allow for a 150-minute final cut, he wouldn’t countenance anything under three hours. Gilbert claimed he gave Lonergan approximately 16 post-production extensions, a claim denied by the director’s lawyer.

By summer 2007 the money had run out and _Margaret_ was still incomplete. Lonergan kept cutting, taking a loan from an old friend, actor Matthew Broderick, to keep working. After Gilbert had the original editors Anne McCabe and Michael Pay put together a two-hour cut while Lonergan was on vacation, the director banned them from working on the film. Fox Searchlight then sued Gilbert for failing to pay his half of the budget; he counter-sued, and the parties settled out of court. By the time _Margaret_ was eventually released, at least six editors had taken a whack at it. The final Lonergan-approved cut – by Martin Scorsese and his editor Thelma Schoonmaker – clocks in at 149 minutes and 40 seconds, just fulfilling the terms of his contract.

Fox Searchlight gave the film almost no publicity on its US release in October: despite releasing it in Chicago, they didn’t even send _Chicago Sun-Times_ film critic Roger Ebert an invitation to the one and only press screening. No one will comment, but it all looks very much like a studio burying a film to punish its maker for hubris. _Margaret_ deserves better.
