For his first project at Alexander Korda’s London Films, Michael Powell was introduced to young Hungarian screenwriter Emeric Pressburger for this World War I drama. The pairing was a propitious one – _The Spy in Black_ was a hit both here and in the US (under the name _U-Boat 29_), and one of the most successful partnerships in British cinema was born.

Released on the eve of World War II in August 1939, _The Spy in Black_ makes an interesting contrast with the later _49th Parallel_ (1941), made as an unambiguous propaganda film. Although both feature a U-boat commander as a villain, Captain Hardt (Conrad Veidt) is a very different character to his counterpart in _49th Parallel_, Lieut. Hirth (Eric Portman). The film goes to some lengths to humanise him in the early part of the film, showing his easy friendship with his colleague Schuster (Marius Goring), and he is altogether a more honourable German.

Filmed in the Orkneys, _The Spy in Black_ marked Powell’s second visit to the Scottish islands, following his breakthrough film _The Edge of the World_ (1937). He was already completely in love with their bleak beauty, and he was back again a few years later to film _‘I Know Where I’m Going!’_ (1945).

By now, Powell was almost a veteran – _Spy_ was his 26th film as director – but this was his first major project, and the light touch and confidence he displayed is surprising. Notably, the minor characters are rounded, believable and treated with respect, quite different from the crude caricatures common in British films of the period, and a step forward from the more stereotyped Welsh villagers in Powell’s earlier _The Phantom Light_ (1935).

In one particularly impressive sequence, in which Hardt makes his way past patrolling guards to establish contact with the ‘schoolmistress’ who he believes to be his ally, Powell showed a rare ability to blend humour and suspense, a gift most commonly associated with Hitchcock, whose position as undisputed master of British cinema was now vacant following his departure for Hollywood.

The starstruck Powell and Pressburger were thrilled to be working with a hero of the German cinema, Conrad Veidt, star of the expressionist classic _The Cabinet of Dr Caligari_ (1919). A strong cast also included Valerie Hobson, June Duprez and Marius Goring; all would work with Powell again.

**A contemporary review**  
This intricate story is gripping from beginning to end, and very skilfully directed. It has abundance of thrilling incidents, effective suspense values, and spectacular sea-scenes. The climax is grim but logical. The acting is outstandingly good. Conrad Veidt is brilliant in the lead. He is throughout a tragic if slightly sinister figure, and wins respect and sympathy as a patriot with the qualities most admirable and admired in soldier, sailor, or airman of any nationality – loyalty, courage, obedience, and steadfast endurance. Valerie Hobson is delightful as the schoolmistress showing resource and humour. The remaining players are all excellent in their different ways. The technical qualities are very good indeed. The atmosphere is realistic and convincing, the photography noteworthy. Pictures of Scapa Flow, of the Orkney Islands, and of the Fleet are particularly effective.
