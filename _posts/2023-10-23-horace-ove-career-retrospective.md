Spanning four decades, Horace Ové’s work encompassed cutting-edge drama and documentary, as well as programmes examining music and the visual arts. At a time when telling authentic Black stories on mainstream broadcast media was incredibly limited, Ové broke through barriers to create films that truly represented a multi-cultural Britain, told with an integrity that reflected his own values and political convictions. In this illustrated discussion, we assess the man, his immense talent, his versatility and his enduring legacy.

**Host: Samira Ahmed** is a journalist and broadcaster and Visiting Professor of Media at Kingston University. She presents a number of BBC programmes including _Newswatch_ and _Sunday Morning Live_ on BBC1 and _Free Thinking_ on Radio 3. Previously a reporter and presenter on Channel 4 News and _Newsnight_, she has also been the BBC’s Los Angeles correspondent and a news anchor for Deutsche Welle TV in Berlin. Samira writes a column in  _The Big Issue_ magazine and has a special love of westerns.

**Annabelle Alcazar** worked as a film and TV producer for over 25 years in the UK, including on _Pressure_ (1978) and producer of two documentaries, _Who Shall We Tell?_ and _Dabbawallahs._ All 3 were directed by her husband Horace Ové. She returned to Trinidad in the mid-1990’s where she was line producer on many music videos and ads including for Jay-Z, Eric Benet and Rihanna. From 2007 to 2018 she was Programme Director at the Trinidad+Tobago film festival. She is currently working on organising Horace’s photographic archive.

**Peter Ansorge** began his career in TV Drama at BBC Birmingham working as script editor and producer under David Rose. His productions there included _Gangsters_, David Hare’s _Licking Hitler_ and _Empire Road_. His later award-winning drama series commissions at Channel 4 include _A Very British Coup, Traffik_, _GBH_, _The Politician’s Wife_ and _Tales of the City_. He commissioned _Playing Away_ and _The Orchid House_ from Horace Ové.

He currently teaches the popular ‘Writing The TV Pilot’ course at the National Film & TV School which is sponsored by Sara Geater at All3Media.

**Tara Prem** started her career as an actress and director in the theatre. She then joined BBC TV English Regions Birmingham based Drama department and wrote the first film with an entirely Asian cast to be made and broadcast by a British TV company. As producer of _Second City Firsts_, a series of half hour dramas by writers and directors new to television, she challenged the status quo, supported stories of under-represented people and championed diverse talent. Her production of Michael Abbensetts’ _Black Christmas_ starring Norman Beaton, led to the commissioning of the series _Empire Road._

**Marcus Ryder MBE** is CEO of the Film and TV Charity. He has more than 25 years’ experience working in the media. Most recently he was Head of External Consultancies at the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity, set up to explore and increase diversity across the media industry. He has worked around the world and previously, was a senior executive at the BBC, winning awards from BAFTA, the Royal Television Society, and the Foreign Press Association.
