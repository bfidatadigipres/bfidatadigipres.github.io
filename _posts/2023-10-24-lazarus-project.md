_+ Q&A with cast Paapa Essiedu, Caroline Quentin, Anjli Mohindra, writer Joe Barton and director Carl Tibbetts._

When the world locks into a never-ending time loop that will ultimately end with the planet’s complete extinction, the Lazarus team must race against time to find a solution before humanity is wiped out forever. Among their number is resolute Lazarus agent, George (Paapa Essiedu), who’s been left in disgrace after betraying the organisation in the name of love.

George is determined to redeem himself and win back the trust of his friends, colleagues, and the love of his life. But when he discovers that the cause he’s fighting is more sinister than it appears, George begins to suspect that the only person he can really trust is himself.

The Lazarus Project is produced by the award-winning team at Urban Myth Films, in association with Sky Studios, and has been created and written by BAFTA nominated Joe Barton (_Giri / Haji_). Series one launched to critical acclaim in June 2022 going on to be Sky Max’s second biggest new scripted launch of the last two years, with a 28-day audience of 1.70m.
