Probably Powell and Pressburger’s most personal and unusual film, _A Canterbury Tale_ bewildered critics and audiences on its release, but has since come to be seen as one of their very best; Pressburger himself later declared it his favourite.

The film is structured as a mystery story, but its real purpose is to add a spiritual dimension to the propaganda message of earlier films like _49th Parallel_ (1941) and _One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ (1942). There are no Nazis in _A Canterbury Tale_ and, although the war provides its backdrop, the focus is on identifying a distinctively moral and spiritual English identity, in direct opposition to the harsh material objectives of fascism.

The film offers a vision of an England with its spiritual roots in the countryside exemplified by the beauty of Kent – the county of Powell’s birth – an England which its increasingly urban population have neglected for too long. Evoking Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_, the film charts the progress of a select band of modern pilgrims. As the trio of land girl Alison (Sheila Sim), American officer Bob (John Sweet) and British officer Peter (Dennis Price) converge on Canterbury Cathedral, each receives a ‘blessing’, bringing his or her most fervent wish to life. The film’s peculiar power owes much to Eric Portman who, as the enigmatic Thomas Colpeper – local Justice of the Peace, prophet and one of Powell’s many screen alter-egos – delivers an intense and complex performance, just as he had in _49th Parallel_ three years earlier.

Despite the trappings of Christianity, particularly the grand finale in the cathedral, the film’s strange atmosphere seems at times closer to paganism than Anglicanism, and the most memorable character, a mysterious man who pours glue in the hair of local women who fraternise with soldiers, resembles a fairytale bogeyman. Critics were particularly uncomfortable with the morally ambiguous figure of the glue man, and many remembered this in their outrage at Powell’s ‘unsavoury’ solo work _Peeping Tom_ (1960) 16 years later.

Eerie and resonant, _A Canterbury Tale_ is perhaps the most complete expression of Powell’s fascination with the mystical power of landscape, which is also visible in works like _The Edge of the World_ (1937), _I Know Where I’m Going!_ (1945), _Black Narcissus_ (1947) and _Gone to Earth_ (1950).

**A contemporary review**  
Girls in a Kent village are frightened to go out after dark because of a mysterious ‘glue man’ who puts glue on their hair. A land girl (Sheila Sim), a British sergeant (Dennis Price), and an American sergeant (Sgt. John Sweet, U.S. Army), track down this villain.

That is the simple ‘popular’ story in this film, but it is interwoven with another – a tale of four people who come to Canterbury to receive a blessing or to do penance, even as Chaucer’s pilgrims did. It is questionable whether this marriage of novelette and philosophy succeeds, but none will deny the beauty instilled into the second story, this sometimes whimsical, vaguely mystical pastoral of Canterbury and its surrounding hills. For translating this loveliness to the screen the excellence of Erwin Hillier’s photography is an important factor. His exteriors carry authentically the atmosphere of the weald and, aided by impressive studio sets and shots of the Cathedral itself, his interiors are equally eloquent. Hillier’s material has been edited with a sure touch, although both editing and direction generally sometimes proceed to a tempo much too leisurely. There is much else of good in this film – its expressive background music, its observant characterisation of many varied types, its wide awareness of the historical background no less than the warlike background of today, the unusual naturalness evoked from practically everyone in it, even its crowds. In the leading roles, Portman does a conscientious job with a difficult role, Sweet creates charm without over-sentimentalising and Price is brisk and efficient.
