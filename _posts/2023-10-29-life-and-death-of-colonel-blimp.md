**Michael Powell on ‘The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp’**  
There was one nice scene in _One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ which I shot but later had to cut out; it's between Godfrey Tearle and Hugh Burden as the elderly rear gunner and the young pilot. They are talking about the girl (played by Pamela Brown) and suddenly the older man makes an observation which startles the young man. He says, ‘You know, you are like what I was when I was young and I’m like what you will be like when you’re old.’ In other words they were both typically British. Then the young fellow looks at him and says, ‘Are you right in the head, George?’ At first nobody understood the old boy and they didn’t bother to, they just thought he was a bit of a nuisance. Later he proved that his experience in everything really meant something. What was really interesting about this was that out of this story Emeric said, ‘Why don’t we make a film about this theme that young men can’t understand the old men and old men can’t explain what it is to be experienced?’ And that started the idea of making a film called ‘The Life and Death of Sugar Candy’.

As it progressed and became more and more an epic, a saga of a wonderful, half-lovable, half-infuriating character, it occurred to one of us, I don’t know which, to lug in Colonel Blimp. It was probably because the whole idea seemed to chime together and the thought of dramatising the life of Colonel Blimp appealed enormously, because at that time Blimp was a household word. That was how _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_ evolved. And that was when all the trouble started which everybody now knows about.

Some time before this, Jack Beddington, who had been Head of Publicity for Shell, had been appointed in charge of the MOl’s films division in the place of Kenneth Clark. We began to have very lively contacts with him. He had a very good mind himself, and as well as understanding publicity, he understood artists and creative people and he took great pains, he and the Ministry, to put us all in touch with the people who were doing documentaries and training films. I remember going there to see films smuggled out of Europe, two or three times a week sometimes, to see films on blood transfusion, on plastic surgery for pilots who were burned … He took great trouble that feature filmmakers should be well-informed, much better informed than the average person about what was going on in the war. It was very good, don’t you think?

I’m sure it was with Jack that we had most of the rows about _Colonel Blimp_. They weren’t really rows: simply that we were determined to make it and they were determined that we shouldn’t. Reddington and Brendan Bracken were probably laughing like hell in their offices, but they had to do what they were told and follow the policy of the War Office and the Cabinet. James Grigg was the one who started the alarm but afterwards he withdrew the whole thing. The thing that affected us was that not only could we not have Laurence Olivier to play Blimp, we couldn’t have one gun, one rifle, one uniform or one truck. So everything we have on the screen in the form of khaki uniforms and trucks is stolen. We could have been shot for it, I suppose, but then nobody minded about a little thing like that then! It shows how well film prop men had been trained by Korda, you know, how do you make a Hungarian omelette ... first steal three eggs. Alfred Junge was wonderful, he hadn’t been on _One of Our Aircraft_ because at first all enemy aliens were interned. There was a story: he was interned at Liverpool in a big camp where a lot of very good art directors were interned who’d worked for Korda. They were all put to work at camouflaging the camp and they did it so well nobody could find it! Alfred was always known as Uncle Alfred to the entire unit.

I don’t really know whether _Blimp_ was ever shown in its complete version because, at the time of its premiere, I was already in the Mediterranean shooting material for _The Volunteer_ (1943). I was on the beach in Oran, Algeria, wondering how to get off it. Of course, I got off with the Americans, that’s the answer always. More or less right away, the Rank people, they loved the picture but decided it was too long for commercial release in wartime and asked us to cut it. I’ve got a feeling that all the opening sequences with the young soldier bursting into the Turkish bath were lopped and the film made into a straightforward narrative story instead of being mostly in flashback. That may have been partly because of opposition from Churchill and the War Office, because it is a much less abrasive way of telling the story. But we had quite consciously set out to make a big epic because we didn’t think we could tell the three episodes of Blimp’s life in much less than two hours and a half.

The cast of _Blimp_ was marvellous. Deborah Kerr is enormously sensitive and responds to a director particularly. I think she could have gone on to become a very great actress, but she went on as a contract artist with MGM for just too long. Her performance, performances really, were clever too – with help from me, she makes the three girls absolutely different. And I had always wanted to work with Roger Livesey; he was going to be in _The Phantom Light_ (1935) but Michael Balcon didn’t like his voice, that lovely hoarse voice of Roger’s. Mickey Balcon was very suburban in his tastes. I hadn’t the slightest doubt; when C. M. Woolf and Arthur Rank said to me if you can’t get Olivier who will you get, I said Roger Livesey. ‘Is he available?’ ‘Yes, he’s working in an aircraft factory’ – I’d already found that out.
