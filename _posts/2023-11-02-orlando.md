**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Virginia Woolf added, and then subtracted, one final line at the end of the manuscript of _Orlando_ (1928), her centuries-spanning fictional biography of the artist as an eternally young androgyne: ‘The secret of life is…’ In Sally Potter’s 1992 film adaptation, it is exactly the secret of life that Orlando (Tilda Swinton) possesses as they gaze wordlessly at the camera, and at us. The 30-second shot finally cuts to black as the Angel (Jimmy Somerville), singing in the branches of the oak tree, ascends to a high note. A few minutes earlier, when the tune began, Orlando instructed, ‘Look. Look up there,’ as the Angel sang that he was ‘coming across the divide to you’. The intertwined power of looking and of coming across divides is the secret that Orlando, and _Orlando_, divulges.

Potter’s second feature film comes across many divides, not only between binary genders, as Orlando transforms from male to female halfway through, but also World War II, which moves Potter to include a vision of the pregnant Orlando running through bombed trenches, just prior to her arrival in our, rather than Woolf’s, present. Pre-production bracketed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the film – one of the first British-European co-productions – appeared to indicate a transformative era in both geo- and gender politics.

Shooting in 1992, partially in Saint Petersburg and Uzbekistan, _Orlando_ had a multilingual, transnational crew. Its effervescent sophistication and mordant wit is underscored by Orlando’s frequent gazes to camera, ridiculing rigid notions of gender, class and nation. And yet the final, silent gaze bears, and bears witness to, the pain of history: even as the Angel voices an ecstatic shattering of boundaries, Orlando conveys to the viewer all they have seen of war, colonialism and separation.

Courageously declaring the hero of a canonical novel ‘neither a woman nor a man’, the closing song ‘Coming’, written by Potter, explicitly contests Section 28 of the UK’s Local Government Act 1988, which forbade the ‘promotion of homosexuality’ in schools. Like Derek Jarman’s adaptations of William Shakespeare (_The Tempest_, 1979), Christopher Marlowe (_Edward II_, 1991) and Wilfred Owen (_War Requiem_, 1989), Potter’s film joyously placed queerness at the heart of Britishness. By the time the film was released, the dominant note in British politics was John Major’s ‘back to basics’ campaign, predicated not least on a moral panic about single motherhood.

Unlike Woolf’s Orlando, Potter’s ends up a single mother, and a dispossessed one at that. Woolf’s Orlando, a successful poet, marries sea captain Shelmerdine Bonthrop and they have a son, enabling her to circumvent sexist inheritance laws and retain possession of her Great House (wish-fulfilment for Woolf’s lover Vita Sackville-West, who lost her own family home to an uncle). Potter’s Orlando sends away Bonthrop, signs away her house, has a daughter, and may or may not sell her manuscript to a publisher who wants her to burnish the love story. Rather than a ‘room of one’s own’ she has a motorbike with a sidecar, and her daughter has a video camera, its grainy footage intercut with Alexei Rodionov’s shimmering 35mm photography.

Running through golden, dry grass, the daughter finally brings her lens close to Orlando’s face, cuing a series of close-ups of her mother framed by the oak tree where the film began, 400 years or 90 minutes ago. The final close-up starts as the Angel sings, ‘We are joined, we are one with a human face’, implying that we see the Angel in Orlando, but also all parts of Orlando’s self, and even ourselves as viewers, carried in the untapped, extraordinary power of the non-binary gaze. For Laura Mulvey, in her essay ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ (1975), the close-up disrupts Hollywood film’s insistence on linear narrative and coherent spaces, infusing it with a ‘different mode of eroticism’, an interruption smoothed over by classical editing; _Orlando_ enhances and is enhanced by this ‘different mode’, embracing the disruption.

Many critics have noted that the final close-up reconfigures that of Rouben Mamoulian’s _Queen Cristina_ (1933). Roland Barthes writes in ‘The Face of Garbo’ (1957), that Garbo’s stillness marks the transition from classical cinema’s mask to post-war film’s individualistic face. Garbo’s, he says, is marked by ‘a kind of voluntary and therefore human relation between the curve of the nostrils and the arch of the eyebrow’. What for Mamoulian is hieratic, for Potter is dramatic: the ‘human relation’ between the mobile bows of Swinton’s eyebrows and lips, their curvature echoed by the fine lines that radiate laughter from the corner of her lips and beneath the eyes that turn to us one last time, carrying the riches and tragedies of a cosmopolitan, queer history across the divide.

**A contemporary review**  
Sally Potter’s long awaited adaptation – or, more appropriately, interpretation – of Virginia Woolf’s celebrated novel (which was written as a love poem to the flamboyant Vita Sackville-West) charts a journey from one Elizabethan age to another. The mythical Orlando shakes off the fetters of biological and cultural destiny to become – as angelic songster Jimmy Somerville, complete with laurels, wigs and lyre , pipes in the finale – a reinvented being that is ‘one with the human race’. Woolf’s creation cannot be easily classified. S/he is not so much an androgyne, rather a person who passes from male status to female over the course of 400 years, finding a first love in the exotic, foreign Sasha which is subsequently reflected and consummated in the adventurer Shelmerdine (Billy Zane may not be able to act but he has a smile at least as bewitching as Charlotte Valandrey’s Sasha).

Sexual ambiguity no longer causes the frisson it did when Woolf was writing, so Potter has made the question of status the central point of the film – Orlando learns how a change in gender is equivalent to excommunication. Lady Orlando is faced with two lawsuits, one which pronounces her legally dead and therefore unable to own property, while the other informs her that she is female – ‘which amounts to the same thing.’ But this death to the world is a rebirth for Orlando, who surveys her naked female form in the mirror in an echo of Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Orlando is never seen naked in his male incarnation – he is never authenticated as a man, rather he remains effeminately boyish. But with Tilda Swinton – in playful mode with frequent nods and winks to the camera – in the title role, the audience knows that there is a woman underneath those clothes. As a privileged child of the aristocracy, Orlando is in any case feminised by the gorgeous finery of his age. Clothes maketh the society man and woman and Orlando seems as uncomfortable in the frock-coats and wigs, the doublet and hose of male attire, as in the cumbersome crinolines that hamper her progress through the Great Hall. Only in Eastern robes does Orlando appear to be free – as much from the constraints of Englishness as of gender.

Indeed, Orlando is full of jokes about the English, whether it be the custom of talking loudly to foreigners (with knowing wit, this particular exchange is in French) or the imperialist habit of collecting countries. The film is also a romp through English history, which it presents as richly textured spectacle. Potter creates an embroidered style similar to that of Peter Greenaway (whose production designers Ben Van Os and Jan Roelfs she has borrowed) which, together with the Nymanesque score; confirms her place in a particular tradition of British European- influenced art cinema. She also flirts with the attractions of pomp and circumstance. The pageant for Queen Elizabeth I is a visual feast of autumnal russet, red and gold, while the eighteenth-century salon’s pastel palette could have been devised by Wedgwood. Details such as the tea-cup shaped topiaries – perfect emblems of the clipped Victorian era – are a delight. A frozen tableau of a woman with flowers and fruit trapped under the ice of the River Thames has a cold beauty – until we realise what is entailed in the creation of that image.

While there are many ironic touches – such as the casting of Quentin Crisp as the Virgin Queen and the twentieth-century salonier Ned Sherrin as Addison – the overladen visual style perversely turns the film into a celebration of the cultural heritage that Orlando in her liberated female state must reject. In the closing scenes, Orlando, in gentrified jodphurs and jacket, joins the tourists and takes her cherubic daughter around the home that once was hers, but which now they can only look at with wonder. In many ways, this epitomises the experience of viewing _Orlando_ itself.
