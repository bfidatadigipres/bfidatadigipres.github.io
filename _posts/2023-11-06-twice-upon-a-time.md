_+ intro by James Bell with Andrew Macdonald_

The only film Pressburger directed alone was this adaptation of a book by his old collaborator Erich Kästner, about identical twins who are separated as babies when their parents’ divorce. Each grows up unaware of the other’s existence, until by chance they meet on holiday and agree to swap places.  A whimsical curio barely released at the time, and all but impossible to see since, it screens on a new digitisation from the negative held at the BFI National Archive.  
**James Bell**

Emeric Pressburger was more than the scenarist whose work Powell rewrote, a fact plain from even a casual look at films either side of their working relationship. His films are distinct, playing with fantasy and personal relationships, rhapsodic and nostalgic. In his partnership with Powell, he created most of their stories, was responsible for most of the producing, collaborated (but never on the floor) in the directing, and worked patiently in the editing room.

Pressburger’s one attempt at directing, _Twice upon a Time_ (1953), showed how greatly he depended on Powell’s sprightly visual cockiness. On the other hand, Powell’s films without Pressburger lack ambiguity and are directed with little sensitivity towards the actors. The visualisation was always predominantly Powell’s, at least in combination with their designers and photographers, but everything was discussed between the two, and it is at this point that their two imaginations met. Who knows how Powell’s or Pressburger’s careers would have developed had Pressburger left for Hollywood in 1938 (as the entertainment journalist Pem expected)? As it was, Pressburger started working for Korda on a story that eventually became _The Red Shoes_ and Korda, shortly after, introduced them to one another.

Pressburger sometimes saw his pension in the continual optioning of stories that went unmade. If they were turned down, as was his third novel, he relegated them not to the wastebin but to the drawer of his desk, where like wine, he would wait for them to mature. Sometimes he misjudged it and the ideas went flat, as with _Miracle in St. Anthony’s Lane_, which he had written in Paris in 1934.

A few years earlier he had slept rough in a famous Berlin synagogue, planning to creep out just before morning service. Too late, he heard the congregation chanting, and crept down, only to be welcomed as a member of the quorum; the service had not started, and the sounds he had heard had been in his imagination. ‘Surely,’ he claimed, ‘a miracle.’ A René Clair-like idea, full of character, with a number of interlocking stories, _Miracle in St. Anthony’s Lane_ was another story of exile, only a step away from this anecdote. It reached the screen only in 1957, directed by Julian Amyes, converted into _Miracle in Soho_. Originally a story of the German exiles in Paris, it had now become one about Italian immigrants in London.

In all the most successful of Pressburger’s writing, his novels included, important and significant events occur inside the heads of the characters. Their limits are those of the imagination. He believed in music’s power to translate human experience and translate human ideals; his favourite work towards the end of his life being Richard Strauss’s _Der Rosenkavalier_. Powell and Pressburger came close to making a Strauss film that would have taken place entirely within the composer’s imagination.

Pressburger’s films, from _Abschied_ in 1930 to _Miracle in Soho_ in 1957, reveal more consistent themes and concerns than their Powell equivalents. Their joint praxis discloses a compatible philosophical view of the world which is essentially anti-Rationalist, expressed not only pictorially but textually, through Pressburger’s belief in the primacy of the perceiver and the role of tradition in constructing a morally integrated world.

**Contemporary reviews**

Unusual domestic comedy drama, with a compelling juvenile interest. Charmian and Yolande Larthe act quite naturally as the girls, while guest artiste Jack Hawkins gives the play star billing in the role of family doctor and narrator. Agreeably mounted and made expressly for the feminine fan, it becomingly wears its heart on its sleeve.

The picture, which employs the long arm of coincidence to bring the twins together, is very ingenious stuff, but, despite its naïve fundamentals, it frequently touches the emotions and confidently addresses its appeal to the fair sex. Good staging, including ‘shots’ of the ballet and the Tyrol, doubly underline its obvious family angle. Human, if extravagant, story, clever and talented child stars, popular supporting players, good atmosphere, intriguing title and homely sentiment.  
**_Kinematograph Weekly_, 21 May 1953**

The remarkable Jack Hawkins, who, now that British films have at last discovered his worth, can do no wrong, crops up all over the place. He plays ‘guest star’ in a pretty little picture, _Twice upon a Time_. Jack plays the part of family doctor and commentator – a nice change into civvies. It isn’t a big part, but he does it splendidly and comes in very useful because the events are none too easy to follow.

Adapted by Emeric Pressburger from a German original, the film tells of young twins who meet accidentally in an Austrian mountain resort, find that they share the same divorced parents and change places in order to bring Mummie (Elizabeth Allan) and Daddie (Hugh Williams) together again. Fourteen-year-old London twin girls, Yolande and Charmian Larthe, play the children, never having been in a picture before.

The production lacks perfection but I fancy that the clean, benign atmosphere of this little joke will be welcome.
