_+ Q&A with director Ella Glendining, hosted by Jack Thorne_

A festival circuit favourite, this thought-provoking, funny and sensitive documentary makes you stop and re-evaluate.

Glendining set out to find others with the same rare disability as herself and challenges the ableist world to re-view concepts of ‘normal’.

Ella Glendining talks to Jack Thorne about her compelling documentary following a screening of the film.

The introduction and Q&A for this screening will have live-captioning and BSL (British Sign Language) interpretation.

In collaboration with the filmmakers, this screening will be presented in relaxed screening conditions, although seating will be designated.
