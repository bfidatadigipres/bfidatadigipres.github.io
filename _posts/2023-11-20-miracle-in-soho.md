In a Rank publicity hand out, Emeric Pressburger summarised his intentions of _Miracle in Soho_: ‘The more I saw of the district the more extraordinary it began to appear to me. But soon I noticed that, as with most places in the world today, the unusual events and happenings of life were taken for granted. Then I began to realise that no matter how commonplace a thing might be there are always one or two people closer to the events who see it in a different light. For them these ordinary happenings are small daily miracles.’ (Paraphrased from Kevin Macdonald’s book, _Emeric Pressburger: The Life and Death of a Screenwriter_, Faber and Faber, 1994)

Pressburger’s script for the film was written in 1934 as _The Miracle in  St. Anthony’s Lane_ and existed largely as a lucrative unfilmed story. Despite constant selling and re-selling during the 1930s, the script found itself in Pressburger’s touting suitcase as an unrealised project, until 22 years later.  At the time, it was the first project Pressburger made without Powell in five years but went on to mark the beginning of the final split between the Archers.

The film is of great interest because of this combination of production history and the ambition of the drama. Nowhere is this combination signified greater than in the setting of the film: the busy street in Soho and its population of émigrés. Carmen Dillon designed the sets for the production and through them brought out the lively character of the district. The production, filmed in only eight weeks was dominated by Dillon’s huge street set in Stage A at Pinewood. Almost two thirds of the action reputedly occurred on this set, forming a suitable feeling of the community and the importance of the street locale to the running of their lives. The sets were initially criticised for their lack of authenticity, a complaint often hailed in a time when ‘social realism’ was taking hold. But Pressburger’s script favours a more ‘poetic’ tinge to the realism. His story is about the magic that comes in the everyday and the colourful sets helped draw this out.

Almost all the main people in the cast are characterised by their familial relationships and their success in love. But Pressburger’s script questions these relationships on two levels. Initially, we are introduced to the two romantic leads, whose family lives differ greatly. Julia Gozzi (Belinda Lee) comes from a close family unit who are planning to emigrate to Canada en masse, despite the fact that the children are now adults. Julia, more than anyone, longs for the family to stay together. In contrast to this, her lover Michael Morgan (a cheeky but likeable John Gregson) comes from a father-son relationship that is strained and awkward. The two find a love that depends on their being close to one another, and when Morgan’s work is finished, the relationship is over. But beyond this idea of togetherness, dramatised through the love between Julia and Michael and emphasised through the use of the street set, the script hints at a state of unity that transcends the physical. It is this spiritual ‘miracle’ that the film celebrates, a spiritual quality that may also be cynically understood as a shrewd marketing ploy.

Raymond Durgnat in _A Mirror for England_ classifies this film in a cycle of religious films. He comments that Rank’s religious Methodism was complicated by a bid to appeal to a Catholic audience. The film came at a time when the importance of the international market was of increasing value to the Rank organisation. The wide diversity of nationalities in the film may be attributed to the profitable Italian market, an appealing market to our shrinking domestic industry that was downsizing due to the onset of television and changes in the regular audience.

In light of these cynical marketing ploys, it seems bizarre that the athletic girl from Budleigh Salterton, Devon, should be playing a fragile Italian. Indeed, her performance lies in the starkest contrast to the busty girl associated with most of her photos and off-set appearances. Despite some acknowledgement of the disparity between Lee’s look and the image of the character, most reviews were favourable, the _Monthly Film Bulletin_ even being taken by a certain charm in her performance.

The conservatism Lee displays in this role was ironic in light of the shape of her developing career in the years that followed this film. Later in 1957 she was loaned to Italy to film _La venere di Cheronea_ (_Aphrodite Goddess of Love_), a move that eventually marked a shift in the development of her career. Whilst there, she began a passionate affair with Vatican official Prince Filippo Orsini, which resulted in a huge scandal and ultimately the termination of her Rank contract.

Pressburger sometimes saw his pension in the continual optioning of stories that went unmade. If they were turned down, as was his third novel, he relegated them not to the wastebin but to the drawer of his desk, where like wine, he would wait for them to mature. Sometimes he misjudged it and the ideas went flat, as with _The Miracle in St. Anthony’s Lane_, which he had written in Paris in 1934.

A few years earlier he had slept rough in a famous Berlin synagogue, planning to creep out just before morning service. Too late, he heard the congregation chanting, and crept down, only to be welcomed as a member of the quorum; the service had not started, and the sounds he had heard had been in his imagination. ‘Surely,’ he claimed, ‘a miracle.’ A René Clair-like idea, full of character, with a number of interlocking stories, _The Miracle in St. Anthony’s Lane_ was another story of exile, only a step away from this anecdote. It reached the screen only in 1957, directed by Julian Amyes, converted into _Miracle in Soho_. Originally a story of the German exiles in Paris, it had now become one about Italian immigrants in London.

In England Pressburger’s original story had been widely admired, but no one wanted to make it and Powell thought it lacked ‘substance’ (a curious observation from the man who chose to direct _Honeymoon_). A postman is at the centre of the web of stories, linking the locals – but the miracle, if there is one, takes place in the church, when Julia (Belinda Lee) prays for her lover, the Lothario of London’s roadworkers, to return. The water-main explodes and brings him back.

Powell recognised it as too close to _A Matter of Life and Death_ and didn’t want to tread old ground, but he might, just as readily, have thought it too similar to _‘I Know Where I’m Going!’_ or to _Blimp_. If _A Matter of Life and Death_ was for Powell ‘the most perfect film’, he is talking about technical perfection; for Pressburger his finest script, although not his most personal one, is _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_, into which is introduced another component from _The Miracle in St. Anthony’s Lane_.

The ‘miracle’, the hopeless dream of a girl in love, is close to the shifts that Pressburger was making in his narratives during the 1930s and 40s: the question is less whether the ‘miracle’ is actually a miracle, conjured up by a prayer in the church, but more whether it exists in the imagination of a lovesick girl. Is it another case of the Indian Rope Trick, as with the Roger Livesey syndrome of _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_? An event that only occurs for those who want to see or dream it in the first place? By the time that _Miracle in Soho_ was made, in 1957, the central creative ideas had been plundered by the Archers and only the bones remained.
