_+ Q&A with cast Lindsay Duncan, Clarke Peters, Sue Johnston, writer  Iain Weatherby, co-creator Charlie Covell and director Chloë Wicks.  Chaired by Miranda Sawyer._

_Truelove_ is a unique spin on a cat and mouse thriller, centering on a gang of older friends who make a pact that, if and when the time comes, rather than let each other suffer a dreadful decline they will engineer a more dignified death as a sign of ‘Truelove’. But when an intrepid young police officer discovers that there is more to this group of retirees than meets the eye, events soon take a surprising and dangerous turn…

With a core cast in their 70s, _Truelove_ offers a refreshingly different take on older age, with its thrilling twists, wry sense of humour, and a passionate love story at its heart, celebrating second chances and the idea that it’s never too late. Meanwhile underpinning all of this is the knottiest of moral questions – is it ever right to help end of life?

Filming took place across Bristol, Somerset and Wales with support from local Film Offices.
