Join us to dive deeper into the breathtaking world of Powell and Pressburger’s Technicolor masterpiece. Pamela Hutchinson, author of the recently published BFI Film Classics book on _The Red Shoes_, will present an illustrated talk examining some of the elements that make the film so endlessly fascinating. She will then be joined by special guests to consider the film’s wide-reaching influence on cinema and other artistic forms.  

**Speakers**  

**Judith Mackrell**  has been writing about dance for over forty years. She was chief dance critic of _The Independent_ between 1986 and 1995 and of _The Guardian_ from 1995 to 2020. She has broadcast widely on the arts and is the author of four critically acclaimed biographies, _Bloomsbury Ballerina_, _Flappers_, _The Unfinished Palazzo_, and _Going with the Boys_, the stories of six women who were front line journalist in World War Two. Her books have been translated into several languages. In 1995 she was elected Honorary Fellow of Trinity Laban Conservatoire and in 2018 was awarded the inaugural One Dance UK award for Dance Writing.

**Helen Persson** is a fashion historian, with over 20 years curatorial experience, mainly with the V&A. There, she conceived, developed and acted as lead curator for the exhibition ‘Shoes: Pleasure and Pain’, and edited the accompanying publication (2015). She curated the touring exhibition to the USA and China, until it finally closed in Hong Kong at the end of 2018. Helen’s research centres on transnational fashion and material culture, primarily concerning Euro-Chinese cultural exchange. She has lectured internationally and published extensively on the subject, notably ‘Orientalism in 1920s Swedish fashion’ in _100 Years of Longing for the Orient: The Swedish Orient Society_ (2023) and ‘Walking Out’ in _Alexander McQueen_(2015). She is a board member of Worthing Theatres & Museum and the Costume Society, UK. Currently, Helen is a SGSAH AHRC PhD candidate at University of Glasgow, researching the trade and fashionable use of Chinese painted silks in eighteenth-century Britain.

**Sally Potter**  made her first 8mm film aged fourteen. She has since written and directed nine feature films, as well as many short films (including _Thriller_ and _Play_) and a television series, and has directed opera (_Carmen_ for the ENO in 2007) and other live work. Her background is in choreography, music, performance art and experimental film. _Orlando_ (1992), Sally Potter’s bold adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s classic novel, first brought her work to a wider audience. It was followed by _The Tango Lesson_ (1996), _The Man Who Cried_ (2000), _Yes_ (2004), _Rage_ (2009), _Ginger & Rosa_ (2012) and _The Party_ (2017). Her latest film, _The Roads Not Taken_ premiered at Berlin Film Festival in 2020 and her latest short film _Look at Me_ premiered at Venice Film Festival 2022. In 2023 Sally released her debut album _Pink Bikini_.

Sally Potter is known for innovative form and risk-taking subject matter and has worked with many of the most notable cinema actors of our time. Sally Potter’s films have won over forty international awards and received both Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. She has had full career retrospectives of her film and video work at the BFI Southbank, London, MoMA, New York, and the Cinematheque, Madrid. She was awarded an OBE in 2012. Her book _Naked Cinema – Working with Actors_ was published by Faber & Faber in March, 2014.

Sally Potter co-founded her production company Adventure Pictures with producer Christopher Sheppard.

Host: **Pamela Hutchinson** is a freelance critic, curator and film historian. She writes for publications including _Sight and Sound_ and _The Guardian_ and regularly appears on BBC radio. Her publications include BFI Film Classics on _The Red Shoes_ and _Pandora’s Box_, as well as _30-Second Cinema_ and essays in several edited collections. She has curated film seasons on Marlene Dietrich and Asta Nielsen for BFI Southbank and a touring programme on Pre-Code cinema, with Christina Newland. She is a columnist for _Sight and Sound_ and edits the Weekly Film Bulletin. Her website SilentLondon.co.uk is devoted to silent cinema.
