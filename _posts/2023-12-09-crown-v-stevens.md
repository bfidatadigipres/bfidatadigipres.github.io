_Crown v. Stevens_ was made by Michael Powell with an eye firmly set on the light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, _Crown_ proved to be his penultimate ‘quota’ film and the last of these that survives intact. His following assignment, _The Man Behind The Mask_ was released only three weeks after _Crown_, and it importantly served as an introduction to producer Joe Rock, who would fund Powell’s first truly ‘personal’ project, _The Edge of the World_ (1937).

_Crown v. Stevens_ was one of five Powell films made for producer Irving Asher at Warner Brothers’ Teddington studios, and is a crime melodrama that, had it been made a few years later, would probably have been labeled a film noir.

Based on a recent novel by the popular and extremely prolific novelist Laurence Meynell (it had been published only a few months before production began), it tells the story of a naïve young man who becomes involved in the machinations of a murderous and ultimately unrepentant femme fatale, played with strength and conviction by Beatrix Thompson, a theatre actress in her only starring role for the cinema.

The rich cinematography is by Basil Emmott and the screenplay is a typically polished effort by Brock Williams; both also worked in the same capacities on three earlier films Powell had made for Asher: _Something Always Happens_ (1933), and two currently ‘lost’ films, _The Girl in the Crowd_ (1934) and _Someday_ (1935). _The Girl in the Crowd_ gave Googie Withersher first film role, and she turns up again in _Crown_, having great fun in a comic role as a breathless party girl with a lust for money, cigarettes and alcohol. The role of the ‘good’ woman is taken by the perky Glennis Lorrimer, who is rather charming in one of her last roles as Patric Knowles’ interior decorator girlfriend; Lorrimer is probably best remembered today as the Lady in the Gainsborough Studios’ opening logo. Although admittedly lightweight, in its ambiguous tone and suggestive cinematography, _Crown_ recalls Powell’s superior _Her Last Affaire_ (1935) and, with the latter, is notable as one of the few comparatively ‘dark’ films he made in this period.

**Behind the Mask**  
Crucial for being the film that introduced Powell to _The Edge of the World_ producer Joe Rock, Powell’s final quota film was this bizarre thriller of masked balls, kidnapping and master criminals. It was long considered lost and listed on the BFI’s ‘Most Wanted’ list, but a 16mm print of a truncated version survived at the George Eastman Museum, and it is from that print that this new scan was taken.
