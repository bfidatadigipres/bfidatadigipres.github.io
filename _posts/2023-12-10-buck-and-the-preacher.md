Black American history is presented through the prism of a Western. Sidney Poitier’s directorial debut, in which he stars opposite Belafonte, tells the story of a wagon master and con-man pastor who join forces to transport African Americans to safety. Belafonte initiated this project and his rascally preacher steals the film. Subverting his matinee idol image, his rousing, high-spirited performance energises the ‘bro-chemistry’ of his relationship with Poitier’s morally upstanding yet fractious ally.

Among the more successful elements of Jordan Peele’s flawed, ambitious space-cowboy foray _Nope_ (2022) is the film’s intelligent engagement with cinema history and visual culture. A particularly significant reference is to Sidney Poitier’s 1972 film _Buck and the Preacher_, the poster of which is seen displayed in the home of horse-wrangler protagonists OJ and Em Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer), as Peele places his film in the context of Black western forebears.

Rooted in 1970s western revisionism and burgeoning Blaxploitation, _Buck_ casts Poitier alongside Harry Belafonte as cowboys in the late 1860s who end up uniting to lead a wagon train of Black settlers from Louisiana to Kansas, all the while trying to outwit the white raiders hired to either intimidate the travellers back to the plantations of the South, or murder them. With echoes of John Ford’s _Wagon Master_ (1950) and numerous westerns focused on the bonding of contrasting male characters (Poitier’s wagonmaster Buck is a wily former soldier; Belafonte’s ‘Preacher’ is really a hustler), _Buck and the Preacher_ is highly allusive. But to view the film merely as a Black Butch and Sundance is to diminish it: Poitier’s film goes deeper, supplementing shoot-outs, chases and comic high jinks with more serious intent, evident in its credit sequence and title-card preamble. This opening, with sepia-toned images of African American pioneers, not only lays out the film’s post-Civil War context from a Black perspective but also announces its intention to challenge historical erasure: ‘This picture is dedicated to those men, women, and children who lie in graves as unmarked as their place in history.’

A subversive streak is evident in numerous aspects, from the film’s nuanced depiction of the relations between African-American and Native American characters to the space given to the character of Buck’s wife Ruth (invested with strength and complexity by the vital Ruby Dee). Poitier’s own performance is compelling, but the film’s wild card is Belafonte’s turn as the wisecracking Preacher, who packs a pistol between the pages of his Good Book.

Introduced during some enthusiastic al fresco ablutions, Belafonte’s pleasure in roughing up his image and persona – yellowed teeth, wild eyes – is palpable; he also has the film’s strongest character arc. Despite some heavy-handed elements (Benny Carter’s score, performed by bluesmen Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee and Don Frank Brooks, is over-insistently employed in the film’s opening stages), Poitier – replacing Joseph Sargent as director – shows great assurance for a first-time filmmaker in modulating shifts from action and comedy to more reflective, emotional moments, bringing out the strengths of Ernest Kinoy’s screenplay. Poitier’s career as a director would encompass both worthy efforts (the 1973 romance _A Warm December_) and woeful ones (the 1990 Bill Cosby comedy _Ghost Dad_); this film, undervalued on release, remains a highlight, and richly rewards rediscovery.
