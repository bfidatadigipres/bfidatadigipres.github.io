_+intro by actor Miranda Richardson and season curator Burt Caesar (on Sunday 17 December only)_

Appearing in both _The Player_ (1992) and _Prêt-à-Porter_ (1994), Harry Belafonte was among the galaxy of stars enlisted by Robert Altman for cameos in his satirical takes on Hollywood and the fashion industry. But in Kansas City Altman offered Belafonte something more substantial: a deliciously nasty role, with a nod to _Uptown Saturday Night_, that the actor seized upon with relish.

As the loquacious underworld kingpin Seldom Seen, whose response to a robbery sets the film’s kidnapping plot in motion, Belafonte is a force: cigar-smoking, coke-snorting and delivering hilariously profane putdowns (some self-penned). The film didn’t get the attention it merited, but at least the New York Film Critics recognised Belafonte’s greatness here, honouring him with a best supporting actor award.

**A contemporary review**  
‘Kansas City here I come!’ These are the words of Big Joe Turner’s classic rhythm and blues song ‘Going to Kansas City’, and it’s also the mission of filmmaking elder statesman Robert Altman in this homage to his hometown. Set in a colourful 30s world, in which the city is an oasis for the political party bosses, gangsters and jazz musicians who ran the show, _Kansas City_ is trademark Altman, a series of interconnected episodes all linked to one central theme: the uses and abuses of power.

The film centres on the evolving relationship between two social opposites, telegraph operator Blondie O’Hara (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her rich, laudanum-soaked hostage Carolyn Stilton (Miranda Richardson). They wander in and out of situations: the after-hours telegraph office at the railway station from which Blondie wires Carolyn’s politically powerful husband, a bar where vote-rigging is being organised by Blondie’s sister’s husband (Steve Buscemi), a home for unmarried African-American mothers, and a cinema featuring Blondie’s role-model Jean Harlow in _Hold Your Man_. But the main point to this journey – other than for the two women to discover they have a lot in common once they get past their surface antagonism – seems to be to spin out the suspense as to whether Blondie’s ploy will save her captive husband Johnny (Dermot Mulroney) from the vengeance of black gangster Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte).

Yet the mundanity of the Blondie-Carolyn relationship by contrast elevates our awareness of the film’s real virtue: its outstanding music. In 1934, _Kansas City_ was a conservatory for jazz, especially the big bands of Count Basie, Jay McShann, and Bennie Moten. From these groups come many of the figures who would later become jazz legends, including Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker (each of whom appears as a character in the film). It was the pervasive wide-open lawlessness of this town that supported the creative environment, and it is this larger environment that Altman’s film tries so hard to capture. Using many of today’s top young jazz musicians – Joshua Redman, Christian McBride, Nicholas Payton, Cyrus Chestnut – as some of the original jazz greats, the many musical scenes jump with a rhythm that leaves the rest of the film searching for a pulse. Because here, the multiple stories that Altman is so famous for weaving, are curiously uninvolving. In fact it would not be a calumny to say that _Kansas City_ seems like an elaborately constructed excuse for some great musical performances.

Hollywood has long maintained a sub-genre of film that uses jazz as a cipher with which to explore America’s racial politics. Films like _Young Man with a Horn_ (1949), _All the Fine Young Cannibals_ (1960), _Paris Blues_ (1961), and _A Man Called Adam_ (1966) recreated the jazz milieu to engage, directly or indirectly, with the racial undertones of the idiom. More recently, films like _‘Round Midnight_ (1986), _Bird_ (1988), and _Mo’ Better Blues_ (1990), have likewise foregrounded race and culture in American society, but more overtly. Altman’s _Kansas City_ easily fits into this latter attitude. The racial politics of the 30s are mostly explored through the gangster character Seldom Seen.  His Hey-Hey Club is a nexus which suggests that the city’s colourful flavour is rooted in a perverted racial co-existence. Harry Belafonte is excellent as Seldom Seen (‘but often heard’). He is a menacing presence who circles the room, smoking cigars, carrying his money around in a cigar box, and dropping words of wisdom in long lectures about the political situation. ‘White people are consumed with greed,’ he says to his captured white criminal Johnny O’Hara, who has tried to rob one of Seen’s best gambling customers. He goes on to explain to Johnny that the Great Depression was because, ‘Y’all couldn’t get enough.’

Seldom’s embrace of black political leader Marcus Garvey and his critique of the establishment are powerfully conveyed, especially with the music of a ‘Coleman Hawkins’ versus ‘Lester Young’ cutting contest playing behind him. But the action is elsewhere, in gangster and election-rigging subplots and whenever Seldom or the music is absent you feel the loss. It is indeed the music that keeps _Kansas City_ alive. When Altman’s _The Player_ was released in 1992, many thought that this 70s Hollywood maverick had finally returned to form after a long hiatus. _The Player_ was a provocatively satirical look at Hollywood’s underbelly made from Michael Tolkin’s wry script that made us realise how much we missed Altman’s light touch with acerbic material. With _Short Cuts_ in 1993, his ability to juggle multiple narratives and many characters was again transfixing, and seemed to suit the mood of the Raymond Carver stories it was based on. Yet the more ad-hoc _Prêt-à-porter_ in 1994 lacked any real insight and _Kansas City_ continues that film’s pattern of aimless filmmaking.

Out of the corrupt party politics of the Democratic bosses, the predictable self-indulgence of the wealthy liberals, and the blonde ambitions of O’Hara and her pathetic husband Johnny, fed by Hollywood, Altman weaves the tapestry of a city life that is long gone. But unlike _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_, _MASH_, or _Nashville_, Altman’s finest movies, _Kansas City_ never gathers its threads together. Nevertheless, Altman remains one of the few independent voices in a sea of repetitive Hollywood mediocrity. Films such as _Kansas City_ at least attempt to focus on real people rather than computer-generated fantasies. And besides, any film that uses jazz as it source – America’s highest art form – can never be given too much attention. For these things only, Altman and _Kansas City_ are to be praised.
