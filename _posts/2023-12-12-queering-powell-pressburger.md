A panel discussion exploring the special resonances Powell and Pressburger’s films have for queer cultures today. With the theatrical high style of _The Red Shoes_ and _The Tales of Hoffmann_, queer performers like Anton Walbrook, Eric Portman and Judith Furse, and a host of trembling same-sex relationships, straight desires rarely run smooth in these films, and a remarkably queer frisson is in the air.

**Zorian Clayton** is a BFI Flare Festival programmer since 2016, and Curator of Prints at the Victoria & Albert Museum specialising in the mid-19th century to now. He was a curatorial advisor for ‘Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear’ (2022) and co-curator of ‘When Walls Talk’, a poster exhibition at The House of European History, Brussels (2022).

A recipient of an Art Fund New Collecting Award to purchase the work of trans and non-binary artists for the V&A collection, he has been the co-chair of the museum’s LGBTQ Working Group for nearly a decade, programming numerous special events and research projects on queer art history.

Contributions to publications include _The Poster: A Visual History_ (V&A, 2020); _Museums, Sexuality, and Gender Activism’_(Routledge, 2020); and he is currently writing a history of queer photography for Thames & Hudson (2024).

**Emma Smart** is Director of Collections, Learning and Engagement at the BFI. She co-programmed the annual BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival for 14 years and in 2022 programmed the BFI Southbank season ‘A Star Is Reborn’, marking the centenary of the iconic Judy Garland. She has given several illustrated lectures about the history of queer cinema and queer icons and has been part of international film juries including Oslo Fusion, Seattle Queer Film Festival and Outfest.

She gained her BA in Communication Studies at the University of Sunderland and her MA in History of Film and Visual Media at Birkbeck College, London.

**Sarah Street** is Professor of Film, University of Bristol. Her publications on British cinema include _British National Cinema_ (1997) and _Transatlantic Crossings: British Feature Films in the USA_ (2002) and _Black Narcissus_ (2005). In 2007 she co-edited with Jackie Stacey _Queer Screen: A Screen Reader_. Her publications on colour films include _Colour Films in Britain: The Negotiation of Innovation, 1900-55_ (2012, winner of the BAFTSS book prize 2014), and two co-edited collections (with Simon Brown and Liz Watkins), _Color and the Moving Image: History, Theory, Aesthetics, Archive_ (2012) and _British Colour Cinema: Practices and Theories_ (2013). Her latest books are _Deborah Kerr_ (2018); _Chromatic Modernity: Color, Cinema, and Media of the 1920s_ (2019, co-authored with Joshua Yumibe; winner of Kovács book prize, SCMS 2020 and the IAMHIST-Michael Nelson prize 2021), and _Colour Films in Britain: The Eastmancolor Revolution_ (co- authored with Keith M. Johnston, Paul Frith and Carolyn Rickards). She has contributed a chapter on colour in Powell and Pressburger’s films in _The Cinema of Powell and Pressburger_, edited by Nathalie Morris and Claire Smith (2023).

Host: **Andrew Moor** (Reader in Cinema History, Screen Studies Network, Manchester Metropolitan University) is the author of _Powell and Pressburger: A Cinema of Magic Spaces_ (I.B.Tauris) and co-editor (with Ian Christie) of _The Cinema of Michael Powell: International perspectives on an English filmmaker_ (BFI).
