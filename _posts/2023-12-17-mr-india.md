_+ Q&A with producer Mr Boney Kapoor_

_Mr. India_ is the only real ‘Bollywood’ film made by Shekhar Kapur, whose earlier film _Masoom_ was more in the style of the parallel Hindi cinema, while his later works, _Bandit Queen_ and _Elizabeth_ (1998), are made in a western style. This was the last film that [writers] Salim-Javed ever worked on together, and featured their usual mix of social issues (food adulteration), populism (the moment where Mr. India removes the groaning table of the decadent rich to give it to the beggars on the street) and pastiche of, and quotes from, other Hindi films, notably in a song medley.

Anil Kapoor and Sridevi were well cast in their roles in the film. Anil Kapoor is excellent as Arun, the son out to avenge his father’s death at the hands of the evil Mogambo (Amrish Puri in a very silly blond wig, with plenty of gadgets, a pink acid pit and a great catchphrase: ‘Mogambo khush hua!/Mobambo is pleased!’), who is hell-bent on taking over the world. Arun’s father has left him a wristband that makes him invisible and allows him to carry out heroic acts as ‘Mr. India’. His chaotic life includes running a small orphanage from his house. Into this world comes Seema (Sridevi), an investigative journalist, who falls in love with the invisible Mr. India, finding out later that it is the man she knows.

The songs by Laxmikant-Pyarelal (lyrics by Javed Akhtar) are among the film’s high spots. The famous ‘Hawa hawaii’ song, quoted in Mira Nair’s _Salaam Bombay!_ (1988), is a pastiche of all nightclub songs, as Sridevi dons a bewildering change of costumes to divert the gang’s attention, while she dances and performs comic turns to nonsense and silly lyrics. ‘Kaate nahi katate’ is one of the defining ‘wet sari’ sequences of Hindi cinema, when Sridevi’s now iconic blue chiffon sari is soaked during an erotic encounter with an invisible man. The songs pulsating chorus ‘I love you’ was also much imitated on the streets. Alongside the children’s performance of a medley of songs, ‘Karte hai hum pyaar Mr. India se’ affectionately mocks film-style romance and marriage.

During this period, Sridevi was one of the few female stars whose name was a box-office attraction. After her early days in south Indian films, she soon became a major star in Hindi films, where her sexy dancing, acting skills and comic turns made her one of the last great divas. She became a Yash Chopra heroine in _Chandni_ (1991) and _Lamhe_, repeating her star pairing with Anil Kapoor in the latter.

Shekhar Kapur made _Mr. India_ perhaps as a knowing pastiche of Hollywood and the Hindi movie. There is much in this film for the cinephile, with its many references to Hollywood films, as Arun/Mr. India, blends the Invisible Man with Indiana Jones, in his struggle against a villain worthy of a Bond movie, in this blend of fantasy and detective film with _The Sound of Music_. The heroine even appears as Charlie Chaplin and performs a cabaret number when not working as a journalist on the local rag. The full _masala_, or spice, of the Hindi movie is also present throughout the film, in its narrative, song and dance. After several disastrous attempts from outside India to make pastiches or tributes to Hindi cinema, this is a reminder that it takes great skill to make this kind of film.

**Boney Kapoor** started his career working under legends like Shakti Samanta. The most famous film produced by him remains the Shekhar Kapur directed _Mr. India_, starring his brother Anil Kapoor and his future wife Sridevi. It was the second biggest hit of 1987 and remains a cult classic in India. _Mr. India_ has often been featured in lists of top Bollywood films. On the centenary of Indian cinema, it was declared one of the 100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time.

His other early productions include _Hum Paanch_, which played a key role in establishing actors like Mithun Chakraborty and Amrish Puri in Bollywood. Kapoor also launched many big stars of the Hindi film industry. His production _Woh Saat Din_ launched brother Anil Kapoor, _Prem_ launched younger brother Sanjay Kapoor and Tabu, and _Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe_ launched actress Esha Deol. He produced one of the most expensive films in the history of Hindi cinema: _Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja_ in 1993. In 1997, he produced the box office hit _Judaai_ starring Sridevi and Anil together yet again with Urmila Matondkar.

Kapoor was managing brother Anil’s career well until 1999 and in 2000 he produced _Pukar_. The film won two National Film Awards, including the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration and the National Film Award for Best Actor for Anil Kapoor’s performance.

In 2002, he produced _Company_, directed by Ram Gopal Varma. The film received positive reviews from critics as well as audiences and won six out of the eleven awards it was nominated for at the Filmfare Awards. The film received critical acclaim at the 2004 Austin Film Festival and New York Asian Film Festival. It is the second film in the _Gangster_ series and a sequel to the film _Satya_. It was followed by a sequel, _D_. Film critic Rajeev Masand has labelled it (along with its prequel _Satya_) one of the ‘most influential movies of the past ten years.’ _Company_ marked the introduction of a new genre of film making, a variation of film noir that has been called _Mumbai noir_.

His 2004 film _Run_, starring Abhishek Bachchan, has since achieved a cult status for its comedy scenes, especially the ‘Kauwa Biryani’ scene starring Vijay Raaz. Following this, he produced the comedy film _No Entry_ that became Bollywood’s biggest hit of 2005.

In 2009, Kapoor produced _Wanted_ starring Salman Khan. The film broke many records at the box office upon release, due to Khan’s comeback. He acquired the Tamil and Telugu remake rights of 2016 Hindi film _Pink._ He produced the Tamil version of the film in 2019 as _Nerkonda Paarvai,_ which became a critical and commercial success. Later in 2021, he produced the Telugu version of the film, along with Dil Raju, as _Vakeel Saab_. The film is the highest opener in India following the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the films are his debuts into Tamil and Telugu cinema respectively. In 2023, he made his film acting debut in _Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar_, playing the supporting role of Ranbir Kapoor’s father.

**Mike McCahill (host)** has written on film and TV for _The Telegraph_ since 2003, for _The Guardian_ since 2012, and for _Reader’s Digest_ since 2016. In the intervening years, he has appeared on Radio 4’s _Today_ programme and – with a degree of randomness befitting the man – BBC2’s _Working Lunch_. He has also contributed to the home-viewing reference guide _The DVD Stack_ (Canongate, 2006; second edition 2007), Halliwell’s _The Movies That Matter_ (HarperCollins, 2008) and _The Little White Lies Movie Quiz Book_ (Laurence King, 2019).
