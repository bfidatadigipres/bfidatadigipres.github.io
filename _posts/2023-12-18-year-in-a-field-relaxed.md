_+ intro and discussion_

Filmed in solitude, between the winter solstices of 2020 and 2021, this meditation on the natural world and human impact on the landscape raises questions rather than gives answers. As we watch the seasons change around a 4,000-year-old standing stone, we are invited to focus on small details of life and consider where the impact of climate change is heading. 

The post screening discussion will be hosted by Emily Lyons, event producer and OUT OUTDOORS podcast host.

Event presented in association with Kendal Mountain Festival.
