We seem to have been here before. The very name Fitzcarraldo, corrupted from Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald because the Peruvian Indians had difficulty with the pronunciation, might have been invented expressly for Werner Herzog to make a film about. Not to mention the bizarre history of this quintessential 19th century loser who turned himself, almost inadvertently, into a millionaire rubber tycoon by manhandling a steamboat across a mountain so that he could open up the jungle and (here Herzog’s imagination helped a little) fulfil his dream of gracing it with an opera house.

The sense of _déjà vu_ is instantaneous and inevitable as _Fitzcarraldo_ opens with the camera panning down over the steamy jungle in echo of the extraordinary shot of clouds racing through the treetops near the beginning of _Heart of Glass_, and as Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald quickly proves himself destined to a foolhardy river journey likely to leave him as marooned in madness as the hero of _Aguirre, Wrath of God_. But this jungle, as it turns out, is not tinged with apocalypse like the one in _Aguirre_ or the forest in _Heart of Glass_; nor is Fitzcarraldo treated, like Aguirre, with an awe that overlays the satirical jabs at his vaulting ambition. Herzog, in fact, seems to have left his mysticism at home, allowing him to portray Fitzcarraldo (Klaus Kinski) with a pleasantly mundane mixture of affection and objective curiosity. Compared to Aguirre’s vision of conquest, which might have made of him a new Alexander the Great or a new Adolf Hitler, Fitzcarraldo’s dream is small beer indeed. And Herzog goes out of his way to make it even smaller.

Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald’s passion is introduced in an opening scene at the opera house in Manaus. Arriving late, dishevelled and ticketless after a 1000-mile trip down river from the interior with his devoted admirer, the brothel madame Molly (Claudia Cardinale), Fitzcarraldo is allowed in only because his wild-eyed distress evokes an answering sympathy from a similarly besotten (and Black) usher. The opera (actually staged by Werner Schroeter) is a deliriously tacky _Ernani_, starring Caruso and Sarah Bernhardt, the latter complete with wooden leg and vocal dubber accompanying her mime from the orchestra pit. But as Hernani-Caruso stabs himself and raises his hand in dramatic appeal to the audience, both Molly and Fitzcarraldo take it to be a regal summons. ‘He means me!’ the latter murmurs ecstatically.

There follows an ambivalent scene where Fitzcarraldo, alone in his sordid shack, obligingly puts on a Caruso recording for a circle of adoring Indian children, meanwhile assuring a small black pig that it will have a box of its own when his opera house finally becomes a reality. Later, hoping to secure finance for his project, Fitzcarraldo brings his beloved records along to a reception to which the faithful Molly has invited all the rubber barons. Nobody, with the possible exception of a couple of native servants, is prepared to listen, and the enraged Fitzcarraldo launches into an impassioned defence of music as an expression of man’s greatest feelings.

Then, capping the missionary theme as it were, the extraordinary sequence in which the ship steams placidly up river into savage Indian territory from which no traveller can hope to return alive, the crew fearfully eyeing the impenetrable jungle in which nothing can be seen, only ominous drums heard. ‘Now it’s Caruso’s turn,’ Fitzcarraldo announces. A hallucinating Herzogian shot of the now seemingly deserted ship ploughing on, an ancient loudspeaker gramophone perched like a figurehead on the bridgework. And suddenly the drumming is stilled, leaving Caruso’s majestically scratchy voice as lord of the jungle.

Yet when Fitzcarraldo finally achieves a transient approximation of his dream – after discovering that the failure of his expedition has ironically turned into a triumph, he acquires money enough to hire an opera company to stage a private performance on the ship – his chief preoccupation rather punctures the grand, proselytising idea: where is the small black pig, for whom a promise must be kept? What Herzog has done here, disarmingly, is to present a man who has a dream, who aches to share that dream with anybody who will listen, but who never for a moment envisages imposing it by conquest or _force majeure_.

Fitzcarraldo, in other words, may live an exceptional adventure but he is not an exceptional man. A point which Herzog stresses by matching his ‘madness’ against the equal folly of almost every other character in the film. Molly, who throws good money after bad by blindly backing Fitzcarraldo in any crackbrained scheme he can dream up (bringing ice to the jungle, building a station to await a railway). The stout and stolid ship’s captain, almost blind but persuaded that he has a sixth sense to avert danger by distinguishing between reality and hallucination. The rubber tycoon who hurls wads of banknotes into a fishpond, yearning to experience the thrill of knowing what it feels like to go bankrupt. The solitary official left in charge of the derelict and still virginal railway station, proudly guarding something which has almost reverted into the jungle. Even the Indian chief, who lends his tribe in support of Fitzcarraldo’s scheme to haul his steamboat over the mountain, meanwhile secretly dreaming of sinking it in the rapids on the other side to placate the spirits of the river. So rife is the mysterious lure of folly that it becomes almost a password between the characters, until even the villainous Cholo, foisted on the expedition as a spy, becomes a hero and smilingly offers his hand in admiration when he realises the enormity of what Fitzcarraldo is up to.

It’s a beguiling notion, beguilingly expressed in a film which deliberately punctures its own pretensions along with those of its characters, while fabricating anti-climaxes out of their pinnacles of ecstasy or despair. You expect Caruso and choral hosannas to hit the soundtrack at the very moment when the steamboat finally noses over the brow of the mountain, but in fact Herzog displaces the benison to an off-peak moment. You expect the ship to go over the rapids and founder with all hands in glorious Götterdämmerung, but in fact it survives, perkily wagging its tail.

This is not to say that _Fitzcarraldo_ is not spectacular or exciting (which it is), but rather to suggest that Herzog has been at some pains to avoid leaving audiences mystically stranded, as so often before and however pleasurably, amid the clouds of unknowing. It is worth noting, on the one hand, that he goes to the trouble of providing a map of Fitzcarraldo’s itinerary, expounded in detail so that one understands the precise logic of his reasoning. On the other, fringing the mystique of savage superstition, there is the sequence where Fitzcarraldo is told by his interpreter of the Indian belief that a white god in a great vessel will show them a land without sorrow or death. Finally arriving on board, the Indians silently gather round Fitzcarraldo, fingering his shock of yellow hair, touching palms with him in a wonderfully moving gesture (only Bresson is better at the language of hands). At which point the interpreter explains the woundingly matter-of-fact situation: ‘They know we’re not gods, but the ship really impressed them.’ The charm of the film, which shows no sign of its notorious troubles in the making, is that it is very, but not too, Herzog.
