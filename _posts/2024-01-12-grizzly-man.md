Timothy Treadwell is an unusual protagonist for a Herzog film: he has a high, squeaky voice, a mildly effeminate manner and a stridently sentimental impulse towards animals. This seems unlikely in someone who spent the last 13 summers of his life living cheek-by-maw with ten-foot, powerful, aggressive grizzly bears in a remote part of the Alaskan peninsular.

There Treadwell made wildlife video films of wonderfully intimate daring and of a passionate campaigning nature, casting himself as the close protector of the bears, as much from the National Park authorities as from supposed poachers. He used these videos to educate American schoolchildren in storytelling shows for which he never charged a fee. Werner Herzog was given the use of the footage Treadwell shot and he creates an astounding memoir.

Clad in black and wearing ‘cool’ shades, with a bandana or a baseball cap atop his head and a tuft of blonde hair disguising a receding hairline, Treadwell looks and sounds more like the excited LA actor-wannabe he once was than a naturalist. Apparently he tried out for the naïve barman role in _Cheers_ and – according to his own mythology – only just lost out to Woody Harrelson.

Treadwell’s daily self-imposed dilemma is best described in the first to-camera piece Herzog uses. Crouching in the foreground while huge bears graze in magic-hour light behind him, Treadwell talks about a ‘sub-adult gang’ of bears: ‘They’re challenging everything, including me. It goes with the territory. If I show weakness, if I retreat, I may be hurt, I may be killed. I must hold my own if I’m going to remain within this land. For once there is weakness, they will exploit it, they will take me out, they will decapitate me, they will chop me into little pieces. I’m dead.’ It spoils nothing of the experience of watching _Grizzly Man_ to reveal that there is a macabre end to Treadwell’s story. Timothy and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were eventually eaten by a starving grizzly, a bear from the Alaskan interior unknown to him before the autumn of 2003, when he and his companion met their fate.

In Treadwell’s footage the long-familiar bears are given names such as ‘Mr Chocolate’, ‘Rowdy’ and ‘Tabitha’. In self-help mode, he unloads his neurosis and paranoia to the camera, ranting as much about his problems with women as about poachers or park rangers, only breaking off to coo ‘I love you’ to the beasts. He is clearly a disturbed individual, but the film delivers on the promise of Herzog’s introductory justification. ‘Having myself filmed in the wilderness of the jungle,’ says Herzog, ‘I found that beyond a wildlife film, in his material lay dormant a story of astonishing beauty and depth. I discovered a film of human ecstasies and darkest inner turmoil. As if there was a desire in him to leave the confines of his humanness and bond with the bears, Treadwell reached out, feeling a primordial encounter, but in doing so he crossed an invisible borderline.’  
**Nick James, _Sight and Sound_, February 2006**

Timothy Treadwell fits so neatly into the standard Herzog roll-call of self-destructive, Conradian loners, misanthropes, hermits, monomaniacs, outsiders and crazies (Aguirre, Kaspar Hauser, Fitzcarraldo and company) that _Grizzly Man_ sometimes feels a little like a brilliantly executed self-parody. Alas for Treadwell and his lover, it is all brutally real. It’s also fascinating twice over: as a courageously close-up view of Alaskan wildlife, red in tooth and claw, and as an unwittingly self-condemning portrait of the artist as a would-be Tarzan of the Bears. A failed actor before he caught the wilderness bug, Treadwell carefully honed his soliloquies to camera, shooting them again and again in short versions and long versions, calm versions and hysterical versions: he knew he was gradually piecing together a film in which he would be both star and director. The vanity of the man seems rather childlike and appealing in the earlier sequences: he’s a bit of a flake, full of New Age tosh about being a ‘kind warrior’, but well-intentioned and obviously brave.

As the film proceeds, the vanity starts to seem more like wanton arrogance, and the bravery more like megalomania. We learn from old friends and family about a man with major drink and drug problems; a directionless character, abruptly redeemed (or damned) by his discovery of bear life; in short, a loose cannon. A Native American zoologist condemns his actions as ‘disrespectful’ and damaging to the wary association of man and bear that has held for hundreds of years; forest rangers dismiss Treadwell’s belief that he was ‘saving’ bears from poachers as largely fanciful, and say that his habit of accustoming bears to human presences exposed them to the very threat he purported to be fending off. None of these testimonies is as dismaying as Treadwell’s own performances, though, whether in terms of his twee cooing at the huge creatures in baby-talk or his ranting profanities against those he saw as enemies, or his imploring Jehovah, Allah, Buddha and ‘the Hindu floaty thing’ to send rain. Which, by the way, duly comes.

Herzog’s attitude to his protagonist is, as one might expect, reasonably sympathetic. Not that he goes along with Treadwell’s rather infantile view of nature (Treadwell always took his favourite teddy bear along with him on expeditions). ‘I believe,’ Herzog explains in a voiceover so ludicrously deadpan as to provoke whoops of laughter, ‘that the common denominator of the universe is chaos, hostility, murder.’ But he takes his hat off to Treadwell as a brother filmmaker, and commends the quality of some of the images he captured as possessing a force and magic unattainable by Hollywood means.

Up to a point, this sympathy is justified. Treadwell undoubtedly did have a flair for wildlife photography, and some of his sequences – notably those in which he plays with the foxes living close to his tent – suggest that his rapport with animals could be genuine, and not entirely in his naïve mind. Herzog’s film is strongest when most dispassionate and cool-eyed, weakest when it drifts into taking Treadwell on his own valuation, as part-shaman, part-samurai. In death as in life, the person who gets the worst of all worlds is Treadwell’s girlfriend Amie Huguenard. Despite the fact that she and Treadwell had in effect split up, despite the fact that he shouted at her to run for her life, despite her chronic dread of grizzlies, she took a frying pan and bashed at the animal that was mauling him to death. Within six minutes, she was dead, too. If _Grizzly Man_ has a true hero, it is this brave grizzly woman.
