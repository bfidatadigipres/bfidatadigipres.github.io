_The screening on Friday 12 January will be introduced by Ben Roberts,  BFI CEO_

Pee-wee Herman, the on-screen persona of comedian Paul Reubens, is perhaps the most consistently developed comic creation in recent cinema. With his pan-stick facial make-up, rosy cheeks, red lips and slicked-back hair, Pee-wee is a nervous, dapper little man in a child’s suit and a red bowtie (the obvious maturity of the actor hidden not so much by the cosmetic mask as by the schoolboy smirk and gonzoid expressions). The spindly arms emerge from too-short sleeves, the hands flapping in a fey, slightly camp fashion. The feet, too, clad in clown-like white shoes, emerge from half-mast trouser legs, sticking out at strange angles which suggest that they might just stroll off on their own. In between, the bendy body strikes bizarre poses, the skinny torso contorting itself in unison with the akimbo arms and rubbery legs. And to cap it all, the voice and the laugh: the mocking nasal whine of a veteran pig-tail puller, and the self-conscious chuckle of the practised prankster. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Pee-wee persona, though, is his utter ingenuousness, an innocence which not only inspires affection in others, but which also brings out the best in them.

The film’s plot is episodic to the point of surreal juxtaposition, Pee-wee’s roaming about the country in search of his red bicycle taking him, in quick succession, from the giant dinosaurs of the prehistoric museum which adjoins the diner where Simone works, via the freight train and its singing hobo, to the superbly lampooned PR-speak of the guide who shows Pee-wee and the rest of the party around the Alamo museum. Not content with this level of digressiveness, the plot also introduces some imaginative and hilarious dream sequences, in one of which Pee-wee’s prized bicycle is eaten by a dinosaur. These sequences introduce an overtly fantastical element, but from the very outset – Pee wee woken by a Heath Robinson alarm clock to eat his breakfast with a giant fork (and dutifully clean his teeth with an equally giant toothbrush – the film’s visual inventiveness offers the audience a unique, not say oblique, Pee-wee-centred view of the world. There is a preternatural quality to much of the imagery, as if we – like Reubens himself – rediscover our capacity for childlike wonder through our identification with Pee-wee’s point of view.

Where some adults may experience a slight difficulty with Pee-wee’s world is in sharing his none too sophisticated sense of humour, his infantile delight in terrible jokes and wince-inducing puns. On the other hand, there is about _Pee-wee’s Big Adventure_ something of the anarchic physicality and slapstick cartoon energy of the best Frank Tashlin and/or Jerry Lewis films. That said, Pee-wee’s naïve goodness contains none of that undercurrent of cruelty and destructiveness which one sometimes finds in the frustrated dementia of Lewis’ films. There is more of the self-mocking than the self-destructive about Pee-wee’s character. In the final sequence, for example, we see the film-within-the-film starring Pee-wee – in which he has only a walk-on part between the glamourpuss pouting of Morgan Fairchild and the hairy-chested posing of her co-star. To which Pee-wee’s reaction is a resigned shrug of the shoulders and a look which seems to say, ‘Well, what did you expect? That’s Hollywood.’ With his debut feature having taken $45 million at the U.S. box-office, his own successful TV series, _Pee-wee’s Playhouse_, and assured cult status with children and adults alike, Pee-wee’s creator can scarcely say the same.  
**Nigel Floyd, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, August 1987**

Are you ready for the Invasion of The Fruitgum People? Are you ready for  The Geek in The Tight Suit? Are you quite prepared for the likely invasion of catchphrases that will wash up on our novelty-hungry shores when Pee-wee-nia comes to town?

The omens are not precise, but they are unmistakable. A children’s TV show, _Pee-wee’s Playhouse_ (the only one networked featuring a live human being) is drawing a massive audience of adults along with its ‘official’ viewership of tinies. A bit like _Tiswas_, only more so. Much, much more so. Everything talks, everything dances, everything walks around the Playhouse.

Pee-wee Herman, the media phenomenon, descends upon our happy heads when his first feature film, _Pee-wee’s Big Adventure_ is released. And so he is installed in two suites at the Savoy hotel, to entertain the press (‘entertain’ in the loosest possible sense of the word) for a limited season.

I have had more dynamic interviewees.

There are no special influences, but he acknowledges the similarities to almost everyone you might suggest – Jerry Lewis, Harry Langdon. Since his encounter with the French media, he is getting used to the idea of being compared to Jacques Tati, although he confesses not to be all that familiar with his work.

The film actually pre-dates the TV series which has made him a household name in the Altered States of America. Pee-wee evolved out of a little boy character Paul Rubenfeld/Reubens came up with at The Groundlings Theatre in Hollywood. The character turned into a one-man club entertainment, which was videotaped and became a big hit on Home Box Office. _Big Adventure_ came next, and then the _Pee-wee’s Playhouse_ TV series. At which point Pee-wee went mega. At which point Paul Reubens ducked out of the picture.

_Big Adventure_ incorporates many of the original features of the Pee-wee Herman stage show, but the animation, which provides the picture with some startling moments, must have been a new avenue for him? ‘No, actually we did animation on the stage – or a simulation of it, using shadow puppets and things. That element was important right from the beginning.’

The Pee-wee Herman Interview Experience is not designed for openness. He insists on doing all interviews in character. He is projected at the interviewer in full battle drag (the famous ill-fitting grey suit, prissy white shoes and make-up from an original idea by Fred Fellini). It’s late in the day, he’s done a lot of these just lately, and the man-boy is getting a little grizzly, so no questions about reality please, thank you. How, for instance does he switch off Pee-wee at the end of his working day?

‘Well, I work most of the time… I’d rather not comment on that…’

Nor is Pee-wee particularly keen to comment on interpretations of the film. Certainly no comment on the tommy-gun burst of sexual innuendo that riddle his _Big Adventure_. He must be aware of the fragility of his success. He must wonder to himself how people miss the weird aftertaste that the character leaves in the mouth.

But such musings, if he has them, are not to be aired in front of strangers carrying tape recorders. There is, after all, a lot at stake here: there is a second film about to be launched in the States, which he hopes will find its way across the Atlantic rather faster than the first. And there is a theme park, Pee-wee Land, which he hopes to open in Hollywood soon. Don’t rock the boat,  Pee-wee, old son.
