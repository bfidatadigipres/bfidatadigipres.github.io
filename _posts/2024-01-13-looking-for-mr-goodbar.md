_Looking for Mr. Goodbar_ is a film about women’s lib that owes as much to Erica Jong as it does to received wisdom from the male establishment. It exists in a curious margin of late-1970s American cinema, a potent concoction of New Hollywood aesthetics and more dubiously old-fashioned attitudes. And while it maintains that women’s sexual freedom may lead to dire consequences, it is also oddly open to female desire and subjectivity, suggesting a certain conflict at its centre.

_Goodbar_ was adapted from the bestselling Judith Rossner novel of the same name, and both were based on real-life events – the death of Roseann Quinn, a New York teacher found brutally murdered by a casual lover in 1973. Stalwart studio director Richard Brooks (of _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_ fame) cast Diane Keaton in the leading role, as well as soon-to-be stars Richard Gere and Tom Berenger in smaller parts.

Theresa Dunn (Keaton), aka Terry, is a kindly schoolteacher of deaf children by day, hailing from a bourgeois Irish-Catholic family. But Terry is also a shiftless, nocturnal creature, and after dark she prowls disco clubs and dive bars to meet men. She becomes thrill-seeking and sexually assertive, with a propensity for ‘dangerous’ types and a taste for Class A drugs. It’s enjoyably frank, but you can sense that Brooks is going to spoil the fun.

The film charts Terry’s sexual conquests, from highly strung, knife-wielding stud Tony (Gere) to seemingly courteous social worker James (William Atherton). Terry has a prickly inability to go for an ‘appropriate’ man, driven by a stilted, antagonistic relationship with her rigid father. The patriarch is _Goodbar_’s apparent ‘voice of reason’, with a strident view on the ‘bra-burning brigade’ he watches on television.

It’s fair to say that Keaton made a dramatic transformation in 1977.  _Annie Hall_’s April release solidified her star image as a wide-eyed, gawky Midwesterner, bookish and precocious. By the autumn of the same year, the low-key _Goodbar_ saw a limited release. Here, she plays a born-and-bred New Yorker – a cynical man-eater, drug-taker and nightclubber. Annie Hall cries at a spider in the bathtub; Terry Dunn shrieks and laughs when she finds roaches crawling on her things.

Some felt Keaton was miscast, and it’s true that there are few comparable roles in her career. But even as Brooks beats us over the head with slapdash psychoanalysis, trying to ‘explain’ Terry’s promiscuity, she comes to life in Keaton’s able hands. She’s impulsive, quick-witted and bold – a fully fledged woman in spite of the director’s one-note moralising. Terry’s mattress-on-the-floor bohemian sensibility feels modern; her solo trips into busy Manhattan bars, armed with a book and a glass of wine, still make her seem more breezily confident than most. In fact, Terry is so swaggeringly likeable that the narrative seems to adopt her laissez-faire attitude towards life.

There are times when it feels as though _Goodbar_ is offering a compelling revision of gender roles, only to later renege on its promises. Terry is completely autonomous, and has no desire to burden herself with serious romantic entanglements. She openly pursues men, then cuts them off when she’s satisfied.

Perhaps even more pressingly, the film expends an unusual amount of energy focusing on male attributes. In its many softly lit bedroom scenes, the visual emphasis is on its attractive male actors – fit torsos, bare backsides and supple lips. Three years later, Gere would have a similar pin-up role in _American Gigolo_ – another film that foregrounds the female gaze.

Brooks employs a roaming, freewheeling camera, hallucinogenic strobe-light effects and, strikingly, a disco-heavy soundtrack, which instantly offers a louche, hedonistic feel – and _Goodbar_ is sure to include the joyous, sex-positive femininity of Donna Summer and Thelma Houston. Perhaps all of these choices are carefully calculated to flatter a young audience circa ’77, but the narrative really seems to takes unbridled delight in Terry’s own pleasure; it feels as if it’s on her side. This unravels in the brutal finale, when Terry’s fate finally mirrors Roseann Quinn’s. The ‘cautionary’ aspects of the story suddenly seem harrowingly evident – and deeply regressive.

Subject matter notwithstanding, it’s uncertain why _Looking for Mr. Goodbar_ has become one of the rare birds of 1970s American cinema. The film’s unavailability on DVD in both Britain and America has led to whispering. Rumours about its absence vary from the plausible (music rights) to the outlandish (Hershey didn’t like the naming of its chocolate bar in the title).  Poor-quality VHS seems to be the next-best option.

It’d be wrong to suggest that _Looking for Mr. Goodbar_ is an easy watch, but it’s nonetheless worthwhile. In spite of its excesses, there seems to be a pitched internal battle for the film’s soul throughout. The no man’s land between unruly female defiance and reactionary backlash is a peculiar place for _Looking for Mr. Goodbar_ to land – but it’s a revealing one.
