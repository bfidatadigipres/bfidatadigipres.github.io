**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Consistent in nothing if not his eccentricity, Werner Herzog has only in his two most recent features (his eighth and ninth) bothered to do what most young filmmakers do in their first: to come to terms with the past, sort out where they stand in relation to other movies. Herzog has perhaps been assumed (not least by Herzog himself) to be such an original that he doesn’t need to be referred to any tradition. And it may be perverse proof of that to find both _Nosferatu_ and _Woyzeck_ awkwardly digesting their given material, and Herzog with more determination than conviction adapting himself to alien dramatic traditions (in what might be seen as an attempt, ironically, to find himself a specifically Germanic home). Whether or not, by switching to adaptations, Herzog has exhausted his ‘originality’ is another question, but it was probably only a matter of time before this dauntless conquistador should run out of new territories to explore, new landscapes in which to set man (the ridiculous) before nature (the sublime). Herzog, arguably, was already heading up a dead end with _Stroszek_, in which the child of nature suffers the familiar indignities of the road movie hero. The two new films have at least restored the cosmic level to his irony, which never bothered to suggest that such inspired fools as Aguirre, Woodcarver Steiner or Kaspar Hauser should be pitied for their social maladjustment.

That the old Herzog is alive and well might be assumed from the provisional way he has treated his pre-existing texts. It hardly seems relevant to consider whether the films are successful adaptations – the texts are simply man-made landscapes which Herzog rifles for his favourite man-made contradictions: between social roles and transcendental aspirations; between life’s ‘little’ deaths and a profounder death-wish that amounts to life everlasting; between prescribed circles and some limitless trajectory. Herzog’s implicit assertion here that he belongs to certain traditions (Murnau and expressionism; Büchner and the first tragedy of common man) might be construed as an attempt to run for cover-rather in the way his short film _La Soufrière_, having failed to show nature cataclysmically cancelling man, makes do with comments on the social disgrace of the people who live on the side of a volcano. But far from becoming ‘home’ to him, the texts seem to be locations as exotic as the Amazon jungle or the African desert, substitutes for a new physical direction; and if not entirely satisfactory as such, they do allow some room for manoeuvre.

One can assume that Herzog is respectful of Murnau because his _Nosferatu_ literally duplicates so many images from the original. That he wants – or is able – to remake Murnau’s classic is doubtful, because his own identification with the extraordinary, the supernatural, keeps running counter to the story’s insistence on the tragedy of a being who can never die, therefore never love, never live in the present. What Herzog does is to make his own contrary film inside the original, elevating Jonathan Harker from functionary to dual protagonist, so that at the very moment Dracula is released from eternal life by lingering with Lucy beyond first cock-crow, Jonathan is released from the bourgeois present (the canals of Wismar, ever circling on themselves) to become the new emissary of the undead.

A less schizophrenic work, _Woyzeck_ is in many ways a faithful adaptation of George Büchner’s strange fragmentary play, written shortly before his death in 1836 at the age of 23 and unperformed for nearly a century afterwards. Herzog has deleted and compressed some material but invented nothing, and one might assume that he found Büchner’s terse, gnomic dialogue, his non-linear construction and his yoking of a cosmic and a social sense of injustice adaptable enough to his own declamatory, disjunctive style. There is also a characteristic Herzog tension in Büchner: the contradiction between his ‘new’ naturalism (a proletarian hero, first driven crazy and then to murder by an unjust society) and his ‘new’ expressionism (the brief, elliptical scenes) that made the play unperformable for so long.

Herzog even draws imagery from Büchner that is strongly reminiscent of previous Herzog. The fair which the soldier Woyzeck (Klaus Kinski) attends with his common-law wife Marie (Eva Mattes) features a demonstration of the ‘human’ understanding of animals and the low evolutionary standing of some humans (i.e. soldiers) that recalls the exhibition of freaks in _Kaspar_  _Hauser_. Büchner’s archetypes of the bourgeois order, the Doctor and the Captain, who prod experimentally at Woyzeck, and push him towards his final madness by teasing him about Marie’s infidelity with the Drum Major, are also dotty rationalists in the Herzog tradition. The stream beside which Woyzeck kills Marie, and in which he tries to wash away his sin, is conjured at the very beginning of the film as an idyllic setting for the placid, strangely toy-like garrison town (Herzog’s treatment of man and nature taking him by a more direct route than the conventions of expressionism back to Murnau). Woyzeck’s most severe limitation, in fact, might not be its given literary qualities but the extent to which it has allowed Herzog to remake something like _Kaspar_  _Hauser_. Woyzeck is explained here even less than he is in the original: he is an obscurely obsessed mooncalf, tortured by cosmic visions as much as he is victimised by military discipline and the economic need that drives him to take part in the Doctor’s experiments. Büchner’s references to silence, darkness, blindness, and his apocalyptic biblical parables, are also typical of Herzog, but remain tensely contained in the text, unreleased in the imagery.

It is in this respect that one again finds Herzog slipping into two minds about his source. If he has changed little in Büchner, he has significantly reordered the opening scenes, so that one is forced to accept Woyzeck as a visionary, a man whose delirium is somehow more creditable than the functional buffoonery of those around him, before any psychological and/or social causes can be considered. Woyzeck’s first scene with the Captain, for instance, in which he carries out his duties as barber in such a fit of agitation that the officer begs him to slow down, is presented some time before – instead of immediately after – the scene in which he discovers the earrings which the Drum Major has given to Marie. His manic haste thus seems an inexplicable state of soul, or a reaction to the manifest absurdity of his life, rather than the shock of discovering himself a cuckold.

For all the jagged construction of his play, Büchner uses the character’s growing sense of betrayal as his prime motive for murder. Herzog leaves it unclear as to how much Woyzeck knows or guesses about the adultery, so that one is left again with a protagonist carried away by mystical forces, with a social context (as in _La_  _Soufrière_) adduced as an afterthought. Mainly by casting Kinski as a fiercely frenetic Woyzeck – rather than the dolefully accusatory character one would expect if he had followed his original intention of using Bruno S. – Herzog avoids the indulgence of simply remaking _Kaspar_  _Hauser_. He has, more successfully than in _Nosferatu_, accommodated his own personality to the original author; and if it is less than exploratory, the film works finally as a canny holding measure.
