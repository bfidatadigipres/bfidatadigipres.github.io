One of four programmes celebrating the latest in short filmmaking talent.

Places that we arrive at, leave from, and end up. Places that conjure up a memory that knocks you sideways, makes you laugh, evokes a yearning for something that can never return. This collection of competition films, selected from across the LSFF programme, traverse time and space and the spectrum of human emotion. Secrets, grief, the time you felt happiest, the place that feels like home. From the bustling streets of Tehran to sleepy suburban Scotland, these films invite you to peek into communal and deeply personal histories and spaces.

Duncan Cowles (_Scary Adult Things_ for BBC, _Taking Stock_) returns to LSFF with his latest personal documentary, _Outlets_, about his grandmother. Also featuring Sundance 2023 alumni Shalini Adnani’s _White Ant_, and Animafest Zagreb jury winner _Garden of Heart_, and May Ziadé’s _Neo Nadha_, exploring the hidden history of Cairo’s cross-dressing women.
