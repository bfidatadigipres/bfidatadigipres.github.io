The Oscar-nominated creative team from Ireland’s Cartoon Saloon share their secret for success.

With films like _The Secret of Kells_, _The Song of the Sea_, _The Breadwinner_,  _My Father’s Dragon_ and _Wolfwalkers_, Cartoon Saloon has established itself as one of the world’s leading animation studios. As it celebrates its 25th anniversary, the three founders and creative leaders of the Irish studio discuss their history, revealing how they work to produce strong stories and a high-quality, hand-drawn aesthetic.

**Tomm Moore**   
Co-founder and Creative Director of Cartoon Saloon over Cartoon Saloon’s history, Tomm has worked as Director, Art Director, Storyboarder, Animator and Illustrator across a range of the studio's projects. Tomm has directed 3 universally successful feature films. All three were nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Award ® _The Secret of Kells_ in 2010 and the spiritual follow-up, _Song of the Sea_ in 2015. His latest feature film _Wolfwalkers_ which he co-directed with Ross Stewart received several prominent critics’ awards including LAFCA Award and NYFCC Award as well as nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA and wins in several categories including Best Director and Best Independent Feature at the 2021 Annie Awards. Both _Song of the Sea_ and _Wolfwalkers_ won the IFTA for best film while _The Secret of Kells_ won best animation and rising star awards at the IFTAs. Having completed the informal ‘Trilogy’ of Irish folklore and history inspired films he is researching a new direction for the next cycle of features focusing on the Irish diaspora and its connections with other cultures. He is currently working as creative producer across several of Cartoon Saloon’s new film and series projects as well as refocusing on his personal art training, focusing on figure drawing and oil painting. Tomm is a lifelong tattoo and comic book art enthusiast.
