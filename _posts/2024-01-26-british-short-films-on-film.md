_+ intro by directors Andrea Arnold, Ngozi Onwurah and John Smith_

This programme includes drug use, strong racial language and implied animal cruelty.

A selection of the best British short films ever made. From the canon of essential cinema to experimental and rarely seen, all screen on original 35mm and 16mm prints. Inspired by BFI’s Film on Film festival and featuring directing icons of British cinema from the 1950s to the new millennium.

Lindsay Anderson (_If.…_) was part of the radical Free Cinema movement documenting 1950s working class life, _O Dreamland_ being a portrait of visitors to Margate’s iconic fairground. Artist and activist filmmaker Derek Jarman (_Blue_, _Jubilee_) famously worked with The Smiths to showcase songs from their _The Queen Is Dead_ album. Aardman Animations charmed the world with Nick Park’s (Wallace & Gromit) Oscar-winning animation _Creature Comforts_. Award winning short _Coffee Coloured Children_ is by pioneering director Ngozi Onwurah, who’s nineties film _Welcome II the Terrordome_ was the first Black British female directed feature to be commercially released. Veteran experimental British filmmakers Peter Greenaway (_The Draughtsman’s Contract_, _Drowning by Numbers_) and John Smith (_The Black Tower_, _Blight_) are represented here with early visually playful shorts from the 1970s, _Windows_ and _Girl Chewing Gum_. There are also early shorts from contemporary directors Andrea Arnold (_Fish Tank_, _American Honey_) and Menhaj Huda (_Kidulthood_, _Harry & Meghan_) in _Dog_ (starring Freddie Cunliffe) and _Jump Boy_ (starring Preeya Kalidas and Ray Panthaki).
