Ever since the surprise Best Animated Feature Oscar nomination for their debut film, _The Secret of Kells_ (2009), Irish studio Cartoon Saloon has enjoyed a blossoming international reputation among festival programmers, award voters and animation-hungry audiences alike. But _Kells_’ two co-directors have walked distinct creative paths since their first success. Tomm Moore has delved deeper into Irish mythology with _Song of the Sea_ (2014) and _WolfWalkers_ (2020), while Nora Twomey has looked further afield for inspiration: to Taliban-era Afghanistan for _The Breadwinner_ (2017), and now to the US for _My Father’s Dragon_.

It is also, notably, the studio’s first feature collaboration with Netflix, which might go some way to explaining some of its more pronounced shifts from what has come before.

Loosely adapted from Ruth Stiles Gannett’s 1948 novel by Meg LeFauve, who also scripted Pixar’s _Inside Out_ (2015) and its forthcoming sequel, the film sports a cast of Hollywood-grade voice talent, led by Jacob Tremblay (_Room_, 2015; _Doctor Sleep_, 2019) as our hero Elmer, and Gaten Matarazzo (_Stranger Things_, 2016-) as Boris, the cuddly, green-and-yellow-striped young dragon Elmer befriends and helps escape from the perilous Wild Island.

Unlike the formal innovations of _WolfWalkers_, which contrasted sharp-edged designs for its British colonial characters with free-flowing pencil-sketch linework for the Celtic upstarts, _My Father’s Dragon_ adopts a clean, colourful storybook approach that befits its skew towards younger audiences. But the film isn’t unsophisticated: for every armpit fart joke demanded by its buddy-movie stylings, there are shades of complexity one would struggle to find in major studio animated fare. The design of the film’s ostensible antagonists – the creatures of Wild Island who have imprisoned Boris – strikes an intriguing balance between charming and chilling. These creatures also have concerns of their own, something best expressed in a nerve-rattling scene featuring a snap-happy crocodile (voiced by Alan Cumming), who juggles terrorising Elmer with caring for several tiny hatchlings, all vying for his attention. A working parent, even in this fantasy land.

Responsibility is the theme, and the film takes care to give weight to its tweenage protagonist’s plight. Elmer is eager to be an adult, but has some way to go. His growing confidence in himself and the world around him gives him the false burden of having to solve everyone’s problems, from his mother’s financial woes to Boris’s anxieties about growing into a mature ‘after-dragon’. _My Father’s Dragon_ directly addresses that impulse, and attempts to reassure its viewers, young and old, that it’s OK to not have all the answers.
