_\+ intro & discussion_  

In common with many key figures in Werner Herzog’s films, Kaspar Hauser is at odds with his surroundings. Having been isolated through childhood, he is then abandoned in a city where he is treated as a freak and attempts are made to socialise him. Bruno S portrays Kaspar’s inner and social journey with sensitivity, revealing his acute sensory perception and curiosity about the world.

The event and post screening discussion will be hosted  by writer and researcher Dr Ethan Lyon, co-host of Autism Through Cinema podcast.
