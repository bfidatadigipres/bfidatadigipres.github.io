_+ Q&A with Louise Jameson, John Abbott and Annette Woollett_

**The making of ‘Doctor Who: Horror of Fang Rock’**  
Even before it began, Season 15 was causing headaches for the _Doctor Who_ production team. New producer Graham Williams had hoped that his debut series would consist of a string of linked serials under the umbrella title _The Key to Time_, but that would have to wait until the following season as script editor Robert Holmes was already commissioning new stories for the upcoming season. A fan of the Gothic horror style of serial like _The Brain of Morbius_, Holmes was keen to have something similar and set Terrance Dicks to work on a suitable treatment. Among other writers at work on their submissions were Bob Baker and Dave Martin, who soon ran into difficulties on their script for what should have been the series opener, _The Invisible Enemy_. Holmes decided to switch things around to give them more time and promoted Dicks’ story to pole position. Dicks had been working on a vampire story titled _The Witch Lords_ since November 1976 and it was officially commissioned under the new title _The Vampire Mutation_ on 11 January 1977. But a sizable spanner was thrown into the works by Graeme MacDonald, the newly appointed Head of Serials at the BBC. Season 15 was expected to be broadcast on BBC One from September 1977 and MacDonald was concerned that a vampire story, so close to the Christmas broadcast of their adaptation of Bram Stoker’s _Dracula_, could cause problems. He particularly worried that it might be seen to be sending up vampires and that it could, be worried, have a detrimental effect on their prestigious drama.

Holmes and producer Graham Williams were told that _The Vampire Mutation_ had to go (Dicks would eventually revive the scripts as the serial _State of Decay_ in 1980) and they were forced to move _The Invisible Enemy_ back into the first slot of the recording schedule. But Dicks offered to write them something else to replace his now temporarily abandoned scripts, believing that he could get something written before production was due to start. Holmes thought that a lighthouse setting might be a good idea – limited sets and a small number of characters – and made Dicks aware of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson’s 1912 poem _Flannan Isle_ which he thought might be an inspiration. Gibson had in turn taken inspiration from the December 1900 story of a supply ship coming across an abandoned lighthouse on Eilean Mòr, its crew having apparently vanished without trace – The Doctor would quote from the poem at the end of the final episode.

True to his word, Dicks turned in a treatment, then going by the title _Rocks of Doom_, by early March, four scripts being commissioned retroactively on 31 March. Dicks decided to cast as the villain a Rutan, one of a race of invisible characters first mentioned in _The Time Warrior_ (1973), a species locked in an endless war with the Sontarans. By the end of March, the scripts were complete, though the title _Rocks of Doom_ didn’t meet with much enthusiasm and several alternatives were proposed, including _The Monster of Fang Rock_ and _The Beast of Fang Rock_ before the final title of _Horror of Fang Rock_ was settled upon. Paddy Russell, who had been contracted for _The Vampire Mutation_, and who had worked with Tom Baker before on the similarly Gothic horror flavoured _Pyramids of Mars_ (1975), was retained as director but she was unimpressed by the scripts and particularly disliked the setting.

Russell was concerned about the circular sets which would require special lighting and a new way of working, but there was about to be a second spanner in the works that would cause her and the production crew further headaches. It turned out that engineering works at the BBC Television Centre meant that space would be at a premium during _Fang Rock_’s scheduled production dates, forcing the production to temporarily relocate to Pebble Mill Studio A in Birmingham. Some among the production team felt that the Pebble Mill facilities weren’t up to the standards of Television Centre and that the special requirements demanded by _Doctor Who_ might be too much for the studio.

Louise Jameson also had issues with the scripts and made numerous suggestions to address what she saw as inconsistencies in her character Leela. She was also able to finally get rid of the brown contact lenses she was forced to wear (her natural blue eyes were deemed unsuitable for a warrior like Leela) which she found uncomfortable, and which restricted her vision. Williams agreed that they could go, and Dicks wrote in a late addition to the story, in which Leela is temporarily blinded by looking at the explosion of the Rutan mothership, turning her eyes blue.

As Jameson, Tom Baker and the production crew readied themselves for the first _Doctor Who_ studio recording outside of Television Centre, work began on the special effects sequences at the BBC’s new Visual Effects Department Model Stage in Acton, London. Filming began on 26 April and was completed on 2 May, with scenes set on the rocks outside the lighthouse filmed at the BBC Television Film Studios in Ealing from 4 May. Rehearsals were now under way, and it was becoming clear that Baker was proving increasingly difficult with Jameson. Baker disliked Leela as he felt that she was too violent to be a companion and besides, he was making it clear that he thought he didn’t need a companion at all.

Worries about Pebble Mill’s ability to cope with the complexities of a _Doctor Who_ recording proved unfounded, the resident crew – keen to lure more dramas away from Television Centre – being more than willing to go the extra mile to help out. Studio work began at Pebble Mill on 25 May, and although Baker’s relationship with Jameson was getting better, he and Russell clashed several times (‘Tom Baker was easy to deal with at first,’ she told _Doctor Who Magazine_, ‘but the part went to his head completely. By the time I did _Horror of Fang Rock_, he was desperately difficult to work with.’) Despite all that, the main recordings went ahead on schedule, wrapping up on 8 June. The following day, special effects were recorded although there were problems arising from the complexity of the chroma key effects being used and the poor processing of the 16mm film sequences. Russell had to fight for an extra hour of studio time (she was eventually granted an additional three weeks to complete the complex post-production work) and, disillusioned by her experiences, swore to never work on _Doctor Who_ again. And she was true to her word. Though Russell may not have agreed, the hardships were worth it. The first episode of _Horror of Fang Rock_ was broadcast on 3 September, the first episode to go out in the new, slightly earlier timeslot beginning at 6.15pm. 6.8 million viewers tuned in for the first episode, rising to a serial high of 9.9 by the final episode.

Behind the scenes though, changes were afoot at _Doctor Who_. On the day that _Horror of Fang Rock_ debuted, Jameson revealed that she would be leaving the programme at the end of Season 15. And other changes were in the air. Robert Holmes had thought about leaving _Doctor Who_ at the end of Season 14 when former producer Philip Hinchcliffe had moved on. By April 1977, Holmes had made it known to his colleagues that he would be going and suggested that Williams might like to invite Dicks back to the role. But Dicks wasn’t interested and instead, Anthony Read took up the post, overseeing the final stories of Season 15 of the current season, as well as the entirety of Season 16.
