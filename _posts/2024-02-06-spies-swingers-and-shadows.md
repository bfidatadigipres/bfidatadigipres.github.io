Join our special guests, including season curator Bob Stanley, composer Nainita Desai and writer and musician Neil Brand for a richly illustrated discussion about the distinctive sounds of John Barry. The discussion is hosted by Eddi Fiegel, journalist, author and John Barry biographer.

With a focus on Barry’s British years, our panel will explore the significance of his scores for the James Bond franchise and other key titles, consider the changes in British music that influenced his compositions, and reflect on Barry’s legacy.

**Bob Stanley** is a writer, musician and film producer. Since 1987, he has written about music for the _Face_, _Smash Hits_, _NME_, _The Guardian_, _The Times_, the _LA Times_ and the _Paris Review_. Bob is a member of the Mercury-nominated pop group Saint Etienne, and has written two acclaimed pop music histories that span the 20th century – _Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop_ (Faber, 2013) and _Let’s Do It: The Birth of Pop_ (Faber, 2022), which won the 2023 Penderyn Prize. His latest book, _The Bee Gees: Children of the World_, is published by Nine Eight.

An acclaimed Emmy-winning composer with two additional Emmy nominations, **Nainita Desai** is an RTS and World Soundtrack Award 2021 winner of Discovery of the Year. A double BIFA and Cinema Eye Honors nominee; BAFTA Breakthrough Brit and IFMCA Breakthrough Composer of the Year 2019, Nainita was described by _Empire_ Magazine as one of the Top 5 Composers to Watch for 2022, and also won the Women in Film & TV Award for Creative Technology award in 2022.

Amongst various BAFTA, Oscar, and Emmy acclaimed productions, Nainita’s recent projects include the hit Netflix documentary _14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible_ (Executive Produced by Oscar winner Jimmy Chinn) for which her score earned nominations for a Primetime Emmy, Hollywood Music in Media Award, and ASCAP Composer Choice Award.

Her recent project is Oscar winning John Battsek’s feature documentary _The Deepest Breath_ (A24, Netflix) that World Premiered at Sundance 2023 and earned Desai nominations for Best Original Score with the Critics’ Choice Documentary Awards, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards and Best Original Title Theme at the SCL Awards 2024.

Her other notable credits include Oscar nominated and BAFTA & Cannes winning feature doc _For Sama_, Sundance winning film _The Reason I Jump_ and the Emmy nominated score for _Body Parts_.

Following a degree in Maths and studying sound for film at the NFTS in the UK, Nainita began her career as a sound designer on feature films for directors including Werner Herzog and Bertolucci, as well as assistant music engineering for Peter Gabriel. Nainita moves seamlessly between working with orchestras, to scores utilising her collection of custom-made instruments, incorporating electronics, found sound, and experimental sound design which has informed her experimental, deeply immersive approach.
