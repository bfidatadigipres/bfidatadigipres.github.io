Dive into the work of Dorothy Arzner with the UK premiere of this documentary, which traces the filmmaker’s groundbreaking Hollywood career.

Following the screening, film historian Pamela Hutchinson, academic Lies Lanckman and artist filmmaker Michelle Williams Gamaker will join the illustrated discussion hosted by season curator Caroline Cassin. The panel will discuss Arzner’s life and legacy, the dynamics of her professional collaborations and romantic relationships with other women in Hollywood, and her pivotal role as a star-maker.

**Pamela Hutchinson** is a freelance critic, curator and film historian. She is the author of books including BFI Film Classics on _The Red Shoes_ and _Pandora’s Box_. Her curation projects include seasons on Marlene Dietrich and Asta Nielsen for BFI Southbank, and a nationwide touring programme on Pre-Code Hollywood, with Christina Newland. She is a columnist for _Sight and Sound_ and edits the Weekly Film Bulletin. Her website SilentLondon.co.uk is devoted to silent cinema.

**Lies Lanckman** is Senior Lecturer in Film at UWE Bristol. She is the co-founder of NoRMMA, the Network of Research: Movies, Magazines, Audiences, and the editor of _Star Attractions: Twentieth-Century Movie Magazines and Global Fandom_ (2019) and _Stars, Fan Magazines and Audiences: Desire by Design_ (2023). The main focus of her research is Hollywood history of the 1920s-1940s; particular research interests include stardom and fandom, fan magazines, issues of censorship, and the career of Norma Shearer.

**Michelle Williams Gamaker** is an artist filmmaker, based in London. She is joint winner of Film London’s Jarman Award (2020) and winner of Aesthetica’s Short Film Festival’s Best Experimental Film, 2021 and 2023. Her major institutional solo, ‘Our Mountains Are Painted on Glass’ premiered _Thieves_ (2023) a co-commission between Film London, South London Gallery and Dundee Contemporary Arts, where it is currently on exhibition. The show will tour to Bluecoat, Liverpool in May. Williams Gamaker is Reader in BA Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and is currently a British Academy Wolfson Fellow.

**Host: Caroline Cassin** is a freelance film and events programmer, and recently graduated with an MA in Film Studies, Programming and Curation from the National Film and Television School. She hosts a popular monthly pre-Code cinema series called Women & Cocaine at the Cinema Museum in London, which recently had its second international film festival in Helsinki, Finland. She organised the first ever women’s football film festival in the UK, called Kick Like a Girl at the Genesis Cinema, and also hosted the 25th anniversary of the seminal book, _Tipping the Velvet_, which featured a screening and interview with author Sarah Waters. Caroline enjoys utilising archive material in her work to curate cross-media events that bring classic and queer cinema to life through a contemporary lens. Her work largely focuses on championing women’s history, and she is interested in the power of film to inspire positive social change.
