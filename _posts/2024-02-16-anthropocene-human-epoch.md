**Director’s Notes**  
It feels like our films keep getting bigger in scope. I am not sure if this is because getting older naturally brings a more global perspective, or if the urgency around problems we face at a global level demands it. For _ANTHROPOCENE_ we were on six of seven continents in 20 countries and 43 different locations (n.b.: the film and project has been carbon offset). But these ‘big picture’ subjects, I have learned, fall apart without an appropriate balance of scale and detail. Sometimes you need to go up in the sky to convey place, but if you stay up there all the time, you float away from what is meaningful. I think that humans are not meant to remain at an omniscient level, though we like to contemplate from there and technology (helicopters, drones, satellite imagery) allows us to do so. It is in the relationship between scale and detail where our work and Edward Burtynsky’s comes together.

_ANTHROPOCENE_ is third in a trilogy of films that started in 2005. _Manufactured Landscapes_ (which I directed, Peter Mettler shot and Nicholas de Pencier produced) was the first, and followed Burtynsky’s photographic essay of the industrial revolution in China. I was not interested there in making a portrait of the artist (as we did in _Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles_), nor a film that used the work as an arena to explore a philosophical or political problem (as we did in _The True Meaning of Pictures_). Rather, Burtynsky’s photographs and the extraordinary places they conveyed, as well as the non-didactic way they conveyed them, were the starting point. The film tried to intelligently translate one medium into another – which meant in most instances trying to convey scale in time. Hence the eight minute long, single take opening sequence. But without intimacy, scale in film (and this was our last documentary actually shot on film – super 16mm) was not interesting. The vast Eupa factory floor would not have meant as much without the glances up from workers as the dolly passed them, or the person sleeping at his post after everyone left for lunch; the massive resettling of people and cities for the Three Gorges Dam would not have resonated without the woman sewing at the construction site.

In _Watermark_ (which Burtynsky and I co-directed and Nicholas shot and produced), we tried to take the idea of human interaction with water and explore every facet of our use: survival and daily needs, industrial, recreational, religious. Here our biggest lesson was illumination through juxtaposition. The film did not have a lot of information about context; if you needed more than a few words to describe where you were, it wasn’t going to work. So instead we put one place against another to sharpen the focus of both: the Buriganga river next to a pristine Lake Ealue in British Columbia; people taking a sacred bath in the Ganges at the Kumbh Mela next to girls cartwheeling on the beach in California. But here again it was the combination of big picture and particular focus that brought an experiential understanding of context. We could have interviewed a water expert in the Colorado River Delta. But it was the testimony of Inocencia Gonzales from the Cucupá Nation, whose fishing community was decimated as a result of the dry delta, that made viewers understand that place.

_ANTHROPOCENE_ steps one place back from the other two films in its premise, taken from the research of the Anthropocene Working Group: that humans change the Earth and its systems more than all natural processes combined. The film required a global perspective to drive home the fact that we humans, who have really only been up and running in modern civilisation for about 10,000 years, now completely dominate a planet that has been around for 4.5 billion.

How do you convey that domination? Here again it was tempting to stay in the realm of the big; the omniscient. The aerial perspective – through helicopter and cineflix or drones – is woven all through the film, and sometimes the only way you experience a place: the phosphate mines in Florida, for example, or the oil refineries in Houston, Texas. But when everything is big or far away and diagrammatic, scale becomes incomprehensible. So the carrot farmer, Nicole Thelen, whose farm is about to be displaced, illuminates the Bagger, the largest terrestrial excavating machine on the planet, chewing up the earth in the largest open pit coal mine in Germany. A timelapse of one small piece of bleaching coral tells the story of anthropogenic ocean acidification, and the tusks of seven thousand elephants, each one carefully weighed and recorded, becomes the way we understand human-directed extinction.

I think the balance of scale and detail is also where we have learned from each other over 13 years of collaboration. This film certainly deploys the big picture, and endeavours sometimes to convey a place in one wide frame. We have sought the highest resolution and production values possible, even in challenging environments, and have pursued the most innovative technology available to our budgets, to the point where we are launching new AR forms in the museum exhibitions of _ANTHROPOCENE_. But the film also seeks moments of intimacy – the detail needed to reveal, understand or encourage empathy within context. This is where the ethics of engagement are critical, and I would go further to say that ethics are the most important dimension of our filmmaking practice. When you go all over the world for your project, it is crucial to try and do so with humility, and an openness to what the context wants to tell you about itself, especially its overlooked margins or ignored corners.

Below are some stats on the film’s production:
