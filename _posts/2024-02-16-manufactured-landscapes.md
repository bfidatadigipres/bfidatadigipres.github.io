_+ intro by Jennifer Baichwal, Nicholas de Pencier, Edward Burtynsky.  Hosted by Maggi Hurt._

**Edward Burtynsky:** I had to cross some unknown territory through Pennsylvania, which happened to be one of the largest strip-mining areas in the United States. All of a sudden I was in this town called Frackville and I thought, ‘Something feels different here.’ I started to drive around the slag heaps and then finally stood in one spot. It was then I realised that as far as my eye could see, everything had been transformed. There was nothing natural left…

Nature transformed through industry is a predominant theme in my work. I set course to intersect with a contemporary view of the great ages of man; from stone, to minerals, oil, transportation, silicon, and so on. To make these ideas visible I search for subjects that are rich in detail and scale yet open in their meaning. Recycling yards, mine tailings, quarries and refineries are all places that are outside of our normal experience, yet we partake of their output on a daily basis.

These images are meant as metaphors to the dilemma of our modern existence; they search for a dialogue between attraction and repulsion, seduction and fear. We are drawn by desire – a chance at good living, yet we are consciously or unconsciously aware that the world is suffering for our success. Our dependence on nature to provide the materials for our consumption and our concern for the health of our planet sets us into an uneasy contradiction. For me, these images function as reflecting pools of our times.

**Jennifer Baichwal:**  _Manufactured Landscapes_ is a feature-length documentary on the world and work of renowned artist Edward Burtynsky. Burtynsky makes large-scale photographs of ‘manufactured landscapes’ – quarries, recycling yards, factories, mines, dams. He photographs civilisation’s materials and debris and raises all kinds of questions about ethics and aesthetics without trying to answer them.

The film follows Burtynsky to China as he travels the country photographing the evidence and effects of their massive industrial revolution. Sites such as the Three Gorges Dam, which is bigger by 50% than any other dam in the world and displaced over a million people, factory floors over a kilometre long, and the breathtaking scale of Shanghai’s urban renewal are subjects for his lens and our motion picture camera.

Shot in Super-16mm film, _Manufactured Landscapes_ extends the narrative streams of Burtynsky’s photographs, allowing us to meditate on our profound impact on the planet and witness both the epicentres of industrial endeavour and the dumping grounds of its waste. What makes the photographs so powerful is his refusal in them to be didactic. We are all implicated here, they tell us: there are no easy answers. The film continues this approach of presenting complexity, without trying to reach simplistic judgements or reductive resolutions. In the process, it tries to shift our consciousness about the world and the way we live in it.  
**Production notes**

By 1790, the Black Country, a once-wild landscape in the UK’s northern midlands, had become a maze of forges, collieries and ‘tall chimneys belching metallic vapours and at night lit by flames.’ Its pale inhabitants, appalled observers saw, were ragged in black, with streaming red eyes and hair stained green with copper. Thus historian Arthur Bryant’s vividly written snapshot of the first Industrial Revolution as it began to unleash the energy and miseries that made the British Empire and changed the world. Edward Burtynsky’s photographs – a different kind of history-writing altogether – catch the detail and the scale of another industrialising revolution, history taking its next turn, apparently transforming the fortunes of another, older empire: China’s, as its population of 1.3 (US) billion seeks to lurch from nine-tenths agrarian 30 years ago to seven-tenths urban (Beijing’s current plan). We see the vast interiors of factories; giant tips of reclaimed machine trash, imported from far-off nations to be recycled; we see titanic earthworks such as the Three Gorges Dam, a 17-year project involving the relocation of up to two million people; we see the emergence of great cities in new garb – Shanghai as a metropolis of real-estate deals and skyscrapers.

In a sense this is a photo collection opened up and brought to life, with commentary, behind-the-scenes fly-on-the-wall on the negotiation and aftermath of some of the shoots, and some input, overheard or via interview or official statement, from the human subjects, who feature as often as not as minute specks dwarfed by the man-made mountains behind them. Indeed Burtynsky and director Jennifer Baichwal’s main device is a kind of _trompe l’oeil_ of scale, whether it’s starting with a scene then zooming out until you realise that the busy space you first looked at is all but lost in depths of the picture as a whole; or panning back further, till you see the entire picture on a gallery wall being peered at by punters; or cutting from a deserted city of rubble, about to be inundated as the dam is filled, to a pulsing neon city of the future, only to realise it’s an architect’s model; or showing an enormous yard full of shipping containers from the air, so that momentarily you don’t know if it’s a circuit board, or shelving, or art, or what size it is. And then there’s the striking opening scene, an eight-minute walking-pace wordless dolly across an endless factory floor – until you wonder if there isn’t a clever loop in the film...

Since the purpose is to unveil the interconnectedness of tiny, medium-sized, large and global – their relationships and mutual effects – the sense that you’re not actually getting all the information you need in order to know what to make of what you’re seeing feels less disingenuous than part of a dramatising game, rendering the invisible visible. And Burtynsky absolutely has a Ballardian eye for the incongruous, some vast machine shape out of its place and time: the most striking section is perhaps the briefest, when he focuses on Chittagong shipbreaking beach in Bangladesh, where huge rusting tankers sit stranded on otherwise naked mudflats, scavenged and dismantled by local teenagers. We’re told almost nothing about this set-up – except that it’s very poorly paid and very dangerous – but Burtynsky perhaps judges the force of the image more effective than any lecture about economics or sociology. The oddest thing, after all, about omnipresent globalisation is that globalisation is shipping by and large – and yet shipping is indeed culturally invisible these days, even more so than the notion of China as the world’s landfill, the detritus of our modernism the raw matter of their future, busily refashioned to be sold back to us before the oil vanishes (or else the climate).

Visually, the film is rich and subtle – Burtynsky finds an eerie beauty in the starkest, most poisoned, emptied vistas; what’s deathly here is also potent and haunting.
