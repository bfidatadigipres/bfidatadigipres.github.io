_+ Q&A with filmmakers Jennifer Baichwal, Nicholas de Pencier and  Edward Burtynsky; hosted by Dr Eugénie Shinkle_

**Director’s Notes: Jennifer Baichwal**  
Water has a unique capacity to express scale and detail simultaneously. It can be a meandering, pastoral brook and the tiny trickle from the edge of an ice sheet, or it can be a monumental force, like Niagara Falls and the Pacific Ocean. And regardless of the diversity of expression it is, fundamentally, the same substance.

This capacity of water to express scale and detail, to be different and the same, became central to an intelligent translation of Edward Burtynsky’s photographic essay into the medium of film. The big picture, often literally aerial in this case, floats away unless it is rooted in the intimacy of the particular. But the detailed vantage cannot begin to convey the breadth of water’s reach, nor the extent to which we transform it to our needs. So it was in the relationship between these two views that the film emerged, and was what allowed us to navigate 20 stories from ten countries and somehow flow them together into a single, experiential stream.

The collaboration fell easily into a marriage of strengths in production. Burtynsky’s primary focus was the wide view and a translation of scale – into both still and motion picture film. We used helicopters, remote-controlled helicopters, poles, lifts and a variety of aircraft to achieve this. My focus was more on finding the details, the narrative threads that give meaning to the wide view or saturate it. Cinematographer Nick de Pencier had to do both: shooting from vertigo-inducing vantage points on the Xiluodu Dam and trying to convey what 30 million people in one place at the same time looks like (at the Maha Kumbh Mela), to balancing a handheld camera on wobbly 10-inch mud berms in Yunnan’s rice paddies or magnifying details of ice crystals from Greenland ice core samples.

The collaboration in the edit room, which took 11 months, was also strong. Roland Schlimme (who also edited _Manufactured Landscapes_ and _Act of God_) and I waded through 200 hours of original and archival (Greenland) material and then started trying to find the structure and rhythm of the film through a painstaking and somewhat inefficient process of trial and error (inefficiencies mine). This process was punctuated by screenings and more general discussions with Nick and Ed. It is hard to stitch together so many stories without falling into a predictable rhythm or completely losing focus. And the balance of how much information to give while preserving an immersive experience for the viewer is always extremely delicate. I really dislike didactic and mediated content in documentary unless it is mandated by the subject, because the treatment is so predictable that the viewer instantly becomes a passive ingester of material rather than an active partner in the exploration – which of course is the opposite of collaboration. I believe that collaboration also extends to the viewing experience.

As with all of our films, _Watermark_ tries to create a space to think about something in a different way. After three years of almost total immersion, I will never turn on a tap with the same unconscious nonchalance that I did before we embarked on this challenging and deeply rewarding film. I hope the viewer feels the same.

**Artist’s Statement: Edward Burtynsky**  
I began to think about water as a subject for my work in 2007, while on a production tour photographing gold mines in Australia – the first continent in this era to begin drying up. Stories about farmers leaving as their land dehydrated were everywhere in the news. While there I met a photojournalist who recounted a story about an incident he had experienced in a bar in Adelaide. He ordered a beer and a glass of water, finished his beer, paid the bill and was about to leave when the bartender stopped him and instructed him to finish his glass of water. Suddenly water took on a new meaning for me. I realised water, unlike oil, is not optional. Without it we perish.

I thought about ways that I could build a body of work around the idea of water. Unlike my Oil and China projects, with Water I had no preconceived notions about what the images in such a project might look like. I trusted that my intuition would lead me to the pictures.

In 2008 my research started in earnest. I wanted to find ways to make compelling photographs about the human systems employed to redirect and control water. I soon realised that views from ground level could not show the enormous scale of activity. I had to get up high, into the air, to see it from a bird’s-eye perspective. Determined by the specifics of each location, I would find a way to depict the most telling viewpoints. The ensuing four years found me at work in nine countries: employing location crews, using man-lifts, small fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters (both remote and piloted) and a specially designed 50-foot pneumatic mast with camera mount and fibre-optic remote. This pulling away from the earth has allowed me to see our world in ways once unavailable to artists. In addition, the evolution of high-quality digital camera equipment has allowed me to create crisp, finely detailed images from moving aircraft – something that could not be easily accomplished with older, analogue film systems.

As production on the Water project began to roll out I categorised the images into: distress, control, agriculture, aquaculture, waterfront, and finally source. Distress included landscapes such as the Colorado River Delta, that has not seen a drop of water from that river in over 40 years, and is now a desert; or Owens Lake, that saw its water diverted to Los Angeles in 1913 and is now a dry toxic lakebed. Agriculture represents – by far – the largest human activity upon the planet. Approximately 70 percent of all fresh water under our control is dedicated to this activity. I went to China and Spain to see the process of farming fish and seafood. The section, Aquaculture provides a glimpse into a quickly growing and increasingly important food source. Waterfront looks at the way we shape land to create manufactured waterfront properties, and speaks to me about the human need and desire to be near water – even if it is artificial. I went to India to witness the largest pilgrimage on the planet with 35 million people arriving on the holiest day to bathe in the Ganges and release them of their sins – an ancient spiritual belief in the cleansing power and sacredness of water. Source comes from my journey to those places where a critical stage in the hydrological cycle takes place; in the mountains, containing glaciers and pure fresh snow. I went to northern British Columbia and Iceland to capture these images. They are the first landscapes in over 30 years I have taken that focus specifically on pristine wilderness, instead of the imposition of human systems upon it.

I feel this project encompasses some of the most poetic and abstract work of my career. I was seven years old when I discovered my love of making art, while painting landscapes alongside my father who painted as a hobby. I loved the tubes of oil paint and the smell of the linseed oil and the names of their colours: burnt umber, chromium blue, cadmium red. When I was 11 I got my first camera and a complete darkroom. I immediately fell in love with photography and never looked back. However, I never lost my love for painting and have tipped my hat to it a number of times throughout my work.

While executing the Water project, I was pleased to see images emerging that referenced some of my favourite painters, including: Caspar David Friedrich, Jean Dubuffet, David Shapiro, and Richard Diebenkorn. The aerial perspective that I adopted for this project, as well as its subject matter, allowed those influences to seep into my photographs.

Over the past five years I have learned a few things about water. When disrupted from its natural course there are always winners and losers. The moment water cannot find its own way back to the ocean or be absorbed by the ground, we are changing the landscape. When a stream or river is diverted, all life downstream is affected and remains altered until water returns. Insects, plants, frogs, the salamanders and countless other creatures – including people – have paid an enormous price because of our voracious appetite for water – and what we do to the earth while getting at it.
