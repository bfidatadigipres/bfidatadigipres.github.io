The Cunning
<br><br>

The Oska Bright team is delighted to share this selection of highlights ahead of the festival. The festival will explore aspects of the human condition past and present, encompassing morality, conflict and death, from the witch trials of the Middle Ages through to more contemporary struggles, with a focus on LGBTQIA+ perspectives. Be prepared to rethink how you view learning disabilities and autism, as you witness the work of award-winning storytellers and filmmakers. 

Join us following the screening to meet the Oska Bright team and filmmakers behind the festival.
