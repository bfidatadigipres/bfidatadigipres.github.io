**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.  

Carl Franklin’s elegant, intelligent adaptation of Walter Mosley’s novel centres on Second World War veteran Easy Rawlins, hired to find a politician’s fiancée rumoured to hang out in Los Angeles’ Black bars, and subsequently suspected of murder. A pleasingly labyrinthine tale of deceit and betrayal, enhanced by its subtle treatment of race and by the uniformly fine performances of an excellent cast.

**A contemporary review**  
Even as Carl Franklin’s _Devil in a Blue Dress_ opens in Britain, its presence in the United States has all but evaporated – the critically acclaimed film has earned only $15 million in six weeks. _Devil_ isn’t the only film to go belly up last autumn (_Strange Days_ and _Assassins_ are two other big-ticket flops), but in some ways its failure is the most alarming, indicating as it does Hollywood’s failure to sell to mainstream America a black film that defies both stereotype and expectation. Written and directed by the well-respected Franklin, based on a novel by one of the most lauded of modern American detective writers, with one of the industry’s hottest stars at its fore, _Devil in a Blue Dress_ is a movie that should not have failed. The film racked up reams of glowing reviews and seemed to have a lock on the very best in publicity. Still, there were signs of weakness in the print and television campaigns. One could blame it on O.J. (one LA movie reviewer announced that, post-O.J., white people were too angry to get behind _Strange Days_ and its message of racial unity) or just maybe blame it on an industry that one hundred years after its launch still can’t escape the Jim Crow logic of separate-but-equal in movies as in life.

Close to the end of the film, Easy Rawlins, a former aircraft worker who’s gotten tangled up in mystery and murder runs up a dark staircase, clutching his stomach. Hurt, exhausted and driven by a purpose not yet fully understood, Easy is going to see his old friend Joppy, who may or may not have done him a great wrong. The camera waits for him, picking him out from the shadows. The scene is familiar, a blurred memory from a dozen films _noirs_: the hero, maybe Robert Mitchum, maybe Burt Lancaster, races upstairs. He’s wounded and terminally alone. Except that, this time, the scene is shaded differently; this time the man stumbling towards his destiny is played by Denzel Washington.

Based on the sensationally popular novel by Walter Mosley, _Devil in a Blue Dress_ is Franklin’s follow-up to _One False Move_, his deceptively simple, brutally-felt genre-bender. Both films are crime stories in which violence is less a matter of guts and gunplay than of human passions and the American calamity known as race. Set in post-second World War LA, _Devil_ reaches beyond the co-ordinates of story and genre. Although it plays its hand against a pulp tradition that reaches from Raymond Chandler to Chester Himes, the existential crises upon which it twists and turns are rooted in history.

Like a lot of classic _noir_, _Devil in a Blue Dress_ opens while the sun is still shining. The camera prowls through a busy Central Avenue afternoon and into Joppy’s bar, stopping on Easy, sitting alone at a table. Easy is out of work, and recently fired from a good job. Still, there’s a drink on his table. As for the room, it’s a study in brown – not the sepia of nostalgia but a dirty yellow through years of nicotine and casual neglect. There are other men in the bar but they’re just silhouettes, gone soft in the fading light. Then a white man walks in, and Easy’s world collapses.

At the core of _Devil in a Blue Dress_, is a mystery and a couple of murders. Easy has seen death before as a GI in Europe but there’s a different kind of death that walks in with the white man, Dewitt Albright. It has to do with the soul, and what it means to put yourself up on the auction block. Because she’s known to stray into the company of black men, Albright figures on Easy to search Daphne out (‘she likes jazz, pig’s feet and dark meat, know what I mean?’). The pay is $100, more than enough to take care of Easy’s mortgage.

Easy eventually finds Daphne but only after he’s been plunged into political, racial and sexual intrigue. The central mystery, which works fine in the novel, doesn’t make sense in the film because of the curiously misjudged casting of Jennifer Beals as Daphne. The mistake, however, is not a ruinous one. All it proves is that Franklin’s heart lies less with the specificity of film _noir_ and detective fiction than in the ways he can use them. Franklin’s adaptation is faster and leaner than Mosley’s book. It knows how to hit the funny notes as well as the hardboiled. Its surprises aren’t in empty cigarette packages and dribbles of blood, but in unfathomables like love and hate and the way a man called Mouse can be Easy’s oldest friend and still turn a gun on him. Don Cheadle’s Mouse is the single biggest shock in the film. Compact, with lustrous ebony skin and a gold cap that catches light, Cheadle enters laughing, maybe because he knows he’s about to steal home. Washington may never have been as good as he is here but he pales significantly next to his friend.

Such characters and concerns are new to the American screen but for all of its convolutions, the first half of _Devil_ holds to a deliberate, occasionally slow pace with few fluctuations in tone – it’s easy does it. When the pace picks up, the body count does too: rage floods the scene then drops to a savage whisper. The first devil that Easy meets is a corpulent creep with a pet baby boy.  

The second wears a sky blue dress; the third a crisp fedora and a neatly pressed suit and then there’s the devil who stares back when things go sour, and the one who comes up from Texas with two cocked guns and a swallowing grin – a Southern Gothic gone north to remind Easy where he’s come from. ‘They thought I was some kind of new fool,’ says Easy at one point of his voice over, ‘and I guess I was.’ For better and sometimes worse, Easy has left Joppy’s bar for good. He’s put the noir back into film _noir_ and crossed over into the world; there’s no turning back.
