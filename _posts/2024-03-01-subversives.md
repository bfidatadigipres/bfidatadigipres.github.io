This early drama interweaves the stories of four men with complex personal lives (one of whom is a film director) and political affiliations, linked by their presence at a – real-life – public figure’s funeral. The Tavianis’ breakthrough film demonstrates their belief in the power of cinema and includes a nod to Jean-Luc Godard’s then recent _Pierrot le fou_.

In the immediate pre-68 climate, it is the lesson of Franco Fortini (_Verifica dei Poteri_, 1965) and the debate about the social mandate of artists and writers that tempers the impulses of neo-realist partisanship for the Taviani brothers.  In _I sovversivi_, the funeral of Communist leader Togliatti and the symbolic burial of the last vestiges of neo-realism are the Tavianis’ answer to Bellocchio’s _Fists in the Pocket_ and Bertolucci’s _Before the Revolution_. The five stories concerning a cross-section of Italian life already prefigure the sense of post-68 depression and involution soon to grip most of their more famous contemporaries. Ludovico, the paralysed filmmaker unable to work on a project about Leonardo, serves as a prophetic metaphor for the general disillusionment which is to follow the triumphal entrance into film of the various Maoist and extra-parliamentary groups.

It is precisely in this context that the Tavianis’ first film without the mediating presence of [trade-unionist filmmaker and collaborator] Valentino Orsini is subjected to a barrage of attacks and charges of defeatism. The most vociferous opponent is Goffredo Fofi, whose magazine, _Ombre Rosse_, is the bastion of the revolution for student radicals and politicised filmmakers alike. Branded the ‘misguided, blind kittens of the revolution’, the Taviani brothers contend that they want to make behaviourist and not ideological films (sic), that the ‘subversive’ of the title is an adjective to indicate ‘an attitude, by which the present needs to be accepted completely but only in order to verify it, to contradict it.’  
**Don Ranvaud, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, December 1982**

_I Fuorilegge del Matrimonio_ [1963] led to a period of self-assessment, continued research and various unrealised projects (including a _Decameron_, scotched by Pasolini’s project), until in August 1964 the Tavianis were commissioned by the Italian Communist Party, together with a number of other directors (including Pasolini, who interpolated footage into _Uccellacci e Uccellim_), to film the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti, the PCI’s leader and co-founder with Gramsci. From this footage, the brothers gradually developed  _I sovversivi_, mixing documentary fact and speculative fiction, ‘in the hope that it would be difficult to distinguish between the two’, to confront directly the themes arising from the sense of a crucial turning point in Italian political life and the feeling of stagnation resulting from the passing of an era. The film anticipates the explosion of overtly (and frequently glossy) political cinema after 1968.

_I sovversivi_ traces the separate but parallel liberating personal crises of four militant Communist observers of the funeral. Ermanno (played by the prominent folk singer Lucio Dalla), a philosophy graduate, is in the process of breaking with his family background to devote himself to photography, and proclaims his belief in an imminent Communist revolution to all comers. Giulia, the wife of a Communist party official, decides to ‘come out’ and explore her lesbian inclinations. Ettore (Giulio Brogi), an exiled Venezuelan revolutionary, who ‘claims Utopia as a moment of truth – history is not just development, it’s also discontinuity, negation; it doesn’t just happen, it invents itself,’ compares the situation in Italy to that in Venezuela, where he decides to return to take the place of a comrade who has died in the struggle against the dictatorship. And Ludovico, in some ways a self-conscious mirror image of the directors, who is working on a non-commercial film about Leonardo da Vinci, decides that ‘art is not enough – it repels you, makes you want to give it all up and go out and mingle with the people.’ He abandons the literary structure of his film to concentrate on images of liberation, a process which parallels that of  _I sovversivi_ itself, in its demonstration through image and action of the possibility of going beyond discussion to active change.

The quartet of protagonists are ‘subversive’ because their revolutionary fervour takes them beyond the constraints of ideology, history and environment into the sphere of personal action, inventing their own histories, in the absence of a coherent, organised mass political movement, instead of being passive spectators to its conditioning processes. Thus the final image of the film, that of Togliatti’s coffin being lowered into the grave, is presented coldly and unemotionally as a historical terminal point which has been shown to have been superseded by the positive and imaginative decisions of the four subversives.
