_+ Q&A with director Justin Edgar and actors Dominic Coleman & David Proud_

Enlisted to teach a class of wheelchair-users about filmmaking, neurotic Jasper gets a little more than he bargained for.

Hailed in _The Guardian_ as a ‘milestone in mainstream cinema’, _Special People_ is a British comedy from the pioneering production company 104 Films.

It questions condescending outreach projects, self-defeating attitudes within the disabled community and the vacuity of the film business, all with a sly wink and a healthy helping of self-parody. Contemporary censorship of its disability themes resulted in it receiving widespread press coverage.

**Justin Edgar** is an award-winning independent writer and director of four internationally acclaimed feature films for backers including Film4, Creative England and Pathé. His company 104 films worked on the BAFTA nominated _Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll_ and co-produced feature documentary _Notes on Blindness_ which was nominated for three BAFTAs including Best British Film and _I Am Breathing_ which won a Scottish BAFTA.

**David Proud** is an actor, writer and producer, and BAFTA BREAKTHROUGH artist for 2021. He is a core writer on ITV’s _Coronation Street_ with more than 30 episodes to date. David founded the BFI Disability Advisory Group, and is a BAFTA Film committee member.

**Dominic Coleman** is an actor and writer. He is well known for his extensive career in both Film & TV including _Paddington_ (2014), _Yesterday_ (2019) and most recently _Wonka_ (2023).
