_+ Q&A with director Justin Edgar and actors Dominic Coleman & David Proud_

Enlisted to teach a class of wheelchair-users about filmmaking, neurotic Jasper gets a little more than he bargained for.

Hailed in _The Guardian_ as a ‘milestone in mainstream cinema’, _Special People_ is a British comedy from the pioneering production company 104 Films.

It questions condescending outreach projects, self-defeating attitudes within the disabled community and the vacuity of the film business, all with a sly wink and a healthy helping of self-parody. Contemporary censorship of its disability themes resulted in it receiving widespread press coverage.
