**What’s it about?**  
Living a solitary life and longing for fun and excitement, Dog sends off for a robot friend. When it arrives, the two make an immediate connection and Dog’s life is transformed. A trip to the park sees the two displaying disco dancing moves that Travolta could only dream of, but an unexpected event threatens their friendship. Told entirely without dialogue, _Robot Dreams_ is joyful and thought-provoking in equal measure, skilfully delivering its message to young and old alike.  

**‘Robot Dreams’ reviewed**  
The robot of the title dreams of New York sidewalks and other robots and sunflowers who tap-dance; but mostly it dreams of its companion, an anthropomorphic dog it has been separated from and yarns to see again.

The film opens in an East Village apartment, where our melancholic pooch with a paunch is playing Pong by himself. Responding to an ad, Dog – the characters have no personal names – mail-orders a robot companion who, once assembled, brims with childlike naivety and good-natured exuberance.

Their first scenes together play out like a series of early dates: a trip on a row boat, a night in with _The Wizard of Oz_ (1939), roller-skating in Central Park to Earth, Wind & Fire’s ‘September’ (a song that will resurface as a plot device). Whether this is a friendship or a romance isn’t the point; what matters is that they care for one another, and indeed that Robot is capable of caring like a living creature.

This blossoming comes abruptly to a stop after a misadventure leaves Robot paralysed and stranded on a fenced-off beach. Powerless to rescue it, Dog returns to a life of solitude in the city. From here, the film takes on a more episodic rhythm, each season bringing new experiences to Dog and new visitors to Robot’s spot on the beach. But their bond endures in dreams, depicted in surreal sequences that reveal the characters’ attachment to one another and shared fear of abandonment. We see more of Robot’s dreams: poignantly, these are forever remixing the limited experiences it has had in its short life. The very fact that it can have dreams is perhaps the best proof that Robot is alive.

Not a word is spoken in the film. Writer-director Pablo Berger takes his cue from his source, Sara Varon’s graphic novel, also dialogue-free. The effect is to make the relationship between the protagonists, who already lack the particulars of human appearance, even more universal.

Although this is Berger’s first foray into animation, he directs with confidence. Characters and backgrounds are all clean lines and simple colour fills, and the schematic designs allow for some nice visual puns: in one sweet scene, Robot helps teach a hatchling bird to fly by arching and flapping the line of its mouth in imitation of wings. Fast, snappy editing propels the narrative. Shots are framed dynamically, ranging from close-ups that convey thoughts in the absence of words to extreme high-angle long shots, which emphasise Dog’s and Robot’s solitude. New York teems with a menagerie of animals ­– a busking octopus, a sunbathing proboscis monkey – amid which, once again, Dog often appears isolated.

Ultimately, _Robot Dreams_ is a story about how swiftly and lastingly a bond of affection can mark a life, in which the protagonists just happen not to look human. The film strikes a very particular tone. It is easy to follow and entertaining in a way that speaks to children, but the emotions it deals with are adult ones. Wistfulness hangs in the air. The film is not effusive – nobody cries – but it is touching, especially as it approaches its unexpected ending. I loved it for that.
