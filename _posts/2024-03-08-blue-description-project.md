In 1993, Derek Jarman released _Blue_, an epoch-defining account of AIDS, illness, and the experience of disability in a culture of repressive heteronormativity and compulsory able-bodiedness. Despite being referred to as a feature film, _Blue_ never existed exclusively in one medium. It was screened in theatres, simulcast on television and radio, released as a CD, and published as a book, creating opportunities for many different kinds of sensory abilities – visual, aural, and textual – to experience the work.

The formats in which _Blue_ existed before its formal release, and the various modes in which it was made available simultaneously, decentralise its content and resist simplistic and reductive characterisations that claim it is a film with ‘no image’, with ‘nothing to look at’ but a ‘single static shot’ of International Klein Blue that you ‘watch … for the film’s 79 minutes’. _Blue_ provides multiple points of access that are not indexed by a ‘primary’ or ‘intended’ format through which to experience the work. _Blue_’s formal variants allow us to reflect upon the ways that art leverages a series of ability-based assumptions (read _requirements_) to construct an interpretive space for the work to be parsed or understood. _Blue_ complicates singularly formatted work and reveals the degree to which that singularity relies upon wilful inaccessibility.

‘If I have overlooked something you hold precious – write it in the margin.’ (Derek Jarman, _Chroma_, 1994)

Taking up Jarman’s invitation to write in the margin, the BLUE DESCRIPTION PROJECT builds on the multifaceted nature of Jarman’s work through newly commissioned and expansive accessibility. Reflecting _Blue_'s standing as a foundational work of Crip art, the project challenges ableist hierarchies in art while focusing on the generative possibilities of difference and interdependence.

The BLUE DESCRIPTION PROJECT (BDP) is produced by Liza Sylvestre and Christopher Robert Jones (_Crip*_ – _Cripistemology and the Arts_) in partnership with Sarah Hayden (_Voices in the Gallery_). BDP is made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, with support from the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and additional support from the Southampton Institute for Arts and Humanities HEIF Research Stimulus Fund.

**Liza Sylvestre** is a transdisciplinary artist and research assistant professor within the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she has co-founded the initiative Crip* – Cripistemology and the Arts. Her work has been shown internationally at venues such as the Weisman Art Museum (Minneapolis), John Hansard Gallery (Southampton), ARGOS (Brussels), and Museum für Moderne Kunst (Frankfurt). Sylvestre has been the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, most recently a Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship and a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship. She has been artist-in-residence at the Weisman Art Museum and the Center for Applied and Translational Sensory Science and in 2019, she received a Citizens Advocate Award from the Minnesota Commission of the Deaf, DeafBlind, and Hard of Hearing. Sylvestre’s work has been written about in numerous publications and books including _Art in America_, _Mousse Magazine_, _Ocula_ _Magazine_, _Art Monthly_, and _SciArt_ _Magazine_.

**Christopher Robert Jones** is an artist and writer based in Illinois. Their research revolves around the ‘failure’ or ‘malfunctioning’ of the body and how those experiences are situated at points of intersection between Queer and Crip discourses. They are a regular contributor to _Art Papers_ magazine and their work has recently been exhibited at the Krannert Art Museum, Gallery 400, and the Weisman Art Museum. Jones is the co-founder of Crip* – Cripistemology and the Arts, a transdisciplinary initiative that is housed within the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where they are also a research assistant professor.

**Sarah Hayden** is a writer and Associate Professor in Literature and Visual Culture at the University of Southampton. From 2019–2023, she led ‘Voices in the Gallery’, a research, writing and curatorial project on intersections of voice, text and access in contemporary art, funded by the AHRC. In 2022, she developed _slow emergency siren, ongoing: Accessing Handsworth Songs_ in partnership with LUX. Recent writings include essays on Charlie Prodger for Secession Vienna, Sharon Hayes for _Bricks from the Kiln_, and captioning as ‘unvoiceover’ for _Angelaki_.
