Good evening, and thank you for coming along to this talk on the films of Víctor Erice; I hope you find it enjoyable and illuminating. It should last around 90 minutes; around half of that will be devoted to clips. In the programme notes I’ve written for talks in the past, I usually make a point of explaining that I am no expert on the filmmaker in question, merely an enthusiast. This time, I’ll put it differently. While I would certainly hesitate to describe myself as an ‘expert’ on anything – there are too many things of interest for me to devote myself to specialist areas of study – it’s fair to say I may know a little more about Erice and his work than most film writers and programmers. How so? I’ve seen all his films (some of which have been very rarely screened) except for his student work; I’ve watched most of them quite a few times; and I’ve had the rare pleasure and privilege of getting to know their creator a little. Not well – he is, I feel, a fairly private person – but we’ve spent quite a few hours together over the years, admittedly at infrequent intervals, mainly discussing our shared interest in the cinema.

A confession: when I first saw his widely acclaimed feature debut, _The Spirit of the Beehive_, as a student in the mid-70s, I didn’t rate it that highly. To be honest, I don’t think I was sufficiently patient or cinematically sophisticated to appreciate the subtlety and delicacy of a film where so much of importance was left unsaid. I fared better when I caught the _The South_ during its opening run at the Academy Cinema in the early 1980s; I adored its visual beauty, above all else, and its air of mystery – but again, if I’m frank, I still didn’t really grasp its resonance on various levels. I only came to realise why Erice was such a special filmmaker at the press screening of _The Quince Tree Sun_ when it premiered at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Before the screening, rumours had been flying around about this long-awaited third feature from the allegedly reclusive Spaniard (he’s actually Spanish-Basque, but I didn’t know that then): apparently it was about some guy painting a tree in his garden, and therefore, at more than two hours, probably supremely boring. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The film was riveting, imaginative, thought-provoking on many levels and, I felt, some kind of masterpiece. The Cannes jury thought highly of it too, awarding it the Special Jury Prize, while the international critics gave it the FIPRESCI Prize. And at the end of the decade, _The Quince Tree Sun_ was widely cited as one of the most important and impressive film of the 1990s.

Thereafter, silence… at least until _Close Your Eyes_, Erice’s fourth feature-length film, appeared last year. Or so many of the critics reviewing that film seemed to believe. In fact, Erice has made several other films; they just haven’t been features. But a film’s quality has nothing to do with its running time, let alone its success, and _Lifeline_, _La Morte Rouge_ and _Broken Windows_ – all brief, and all, for one reason or another, little seen – are very rewarding works; indeed, both _Lifeline_ and _La Morte Rouge_ are extraordinarily fine. (I even included the latter among my top-ten list for the _Sight and Sound_ Greatest Films polls in 2012 and 2022.)  What’s more, there have been several other features written by Erice over the years; sadly – for him and for us – they never got made, for reasons beyond his control. (Let’s not forget, too, that _The_ _South_, undoubtedly a work of great brilliance, was never completed as Erice planned, since the producer pulled funding during the shoot, with the result that the latter part of the story – actually set in the South, unlike the first part – was never filmed.)

So it’s not as if Erice’s been doing nothing all these years. It’s just that he’s had more than his fair share of bad luck in getting projects made – and that he is unwilling to compromise himself. Why would he spend months, maybe years, making something that didn’t mean something to him personally? At least when we see a film with Erice’s name on it, we know he did it for reasons other than fame and fortune. And it shows. We’ll be looking at some of the things that make Erice’s films so distinctive during this evening’s talk.

There is a great deal to say about Erice’s work, and I shall certainly not have time to deal with everything I’d like to cover in a 90-minute talk. But if you do feel like finding out a little more about his recent work, the forthcoming issue of _Sight and Sound_ will include a feature I’ve written about _Close Your Eyes_ (built around an interview with Erice); and if you’re intrigued about _Stone and Sky_, the two-screen installation he created for the Bilbao Museum of Fine Arts in 2019, the only piece of writing about it in English that I’m aware of can be found (for free, naturally) at geoffandrew.com Finally, for anyone interested in the music played before the talk, it is from the album _Asturiana_, by Kim Kashkashian and Robert Levin)
