Set in and around a Glasgow tenement block during a dustmen’s strike in the mid-’70s, Ramsay’s marvellous first feature centres on a 12-year-old (Eadie) who, haunted by a secret, retreats into a private world of solitude, strange friendships and consoling dreams. A bold lyricism combines with gritty realism to create an impressive and intriguing character study shot through with tenderness and wit.

Lynne Ramsay hated her ﬁrst year at the National Film and Television School. ‘I was like a ﬁsh out of water,’ she remembers. ‘My training was in ﬁne art photography. I could only take static shots and I used the same lens all the time.’ With no preconceived notions of what cinema should be, Ramsay devised her own offbeat visual vocabulary. Experimental but accessible, it’s this distinctive style that distinguishes the 29-year-old director’s striking ﬁrst feature.

Shot in her native Glasgow and set during the refuse workers’ strike of the 70s, _Ratcatcher_ is the story of 12-year-old James Gillespie (William Eadie) who playfully pushes his friend into the canal one day, then watches him drown. As the rubbish mounts among the tenement blocks, his father drinks and his mother waits to be rehoused, the guilt-ridden James withdraws from his family and becomes a silent observer. Morbidly drawn back to the canal, he befriends Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), a gawky 14-year-old whose loneliness leads her into casual sex with the local gang.

Awkward but tender, the loving relationship that develops between these mismatched outsiders is characteristic of the way in which Ramsay constantly wrongfoots audience expectations. Despite its dark storyline, _Ratcatcher_ has a vein of robust humour that prevents it from becoming too gloomy. ‘What are you staring at, you wee pervert?’ snaps James’ older sister as she puts on Ma’s lipstick. Out in the yard, meanwhile, as other kids are clubbing rats to death, James’ animal-loving pal Kenny (John Miller) is sending his pet mouse into space, dangling from a birthday balloon.

Ramsay’s compassionate but unsentimental approach to her working-class characters may call to mind Ken Loach, but she eschews kitchen-sink realism for a more lyrical impressionism. ‘I wanted to make a ﬁlm that was driven by emotion and images rather than narrative,’ says the director, who was inspired to go into ﬁlm-making after watching Maya Deren’s avant-garde classic _Meshes of the Afternoon_ (1943). Seen through the eyes of its 12-year-old protagonist, _Ratcatcher_ shares that ﬁlm’s poetic subjectivity and its atmosphere of surreal, slightly sinister reverie.

Like Deren, Ramsay’s approach to storytelling is both symbolic and oblique. Using a collage of carefully composed images, Ramsay pieces together a jigsaw of James’ world. In one wordless scene his hand scuffs away at the shiny leather of his new sandals (an unwelcome gift from the mother of his dead friend). In another, he ﬁnds freedom and solace in the clean shell of a half-built house. But the fragility of his dream becomes apparent when he pees in the unplumbed toilet and we see the dark stain leaking out onto the concrete below.

Building on a technique she ﬁrst tried in such shorts as _Small Deaths_ and _Gasman_ (which both picked up the Cannes Prix du Jury), Ramsay combines naturalistic performances from non-actors with a stylised visual look that includes long takes, odd angles, jump cuts and a wonderful way with objects. Together they capture the richness of everyday life. While James’ father is smartly groomed for the pub, the rest of the family scratch away at their head lice. Squalid poverty is set against the swooping optimism of Tom Jones’ ‘What’s New Pussycat?’

‘I’ve always relished contradiction,’ says Ramsay. ‘Performances, cutting, camerawork, I like them all to work against each other.’ Like her ﬁlms, Ramsay resists categorisation. After this highly personal ﬁrst feature, she wants to ‘move on’. As we speak, she’s holding out for ﬁnal cut on her next movie, an adaptation of Alan Warner’s novel _Morvern Callar_.

‘I don’t want to become the person who makes ﬁlms about ‘gritty Glasgow’. I don’t want to be called the next Scottish ﬁlmmaker or the next woman ﬁlmmaker. If I come from any tradition it’s a European cinema as opposed to an American one, but I’m not much of a ﬁlm buff either. My approach to ﬁlmmaking is not high-concept at all. It’s actually quite anti-intellectual in some respects. It’s not that I improvise – the images and the dialogue are written very clearly in the shooting script – but I am intuitive. I’m constantly experimenting, ﬁnding out where I want to go. I still feel like a ﬁlm student. I hope I feel that way for the rest of my life.’
