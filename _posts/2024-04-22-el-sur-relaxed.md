Victor Erice’s second feature is a powerful evocation of the imagination’s capacity to craft crepuscular worlds filled with hushed, secretive voices. But it is also a warning about the dangers of living in these seductive fantasies. Join us to discuss and savour this lyrical, tactile masterpiece the only way it should be experienced – on the big screen.

The post screening discussion will be hosted by writer and researcher Dr Ethan Lyon, co-host of the Autism Through Cinema podcast.
