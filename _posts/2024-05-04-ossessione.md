**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

While Rossellini and De Sica were concerned explicitly with chronicling the hardships of wartime and the post-war era, Luchino Visconti’s _Ossessione_ – for many the very first neorealist film – drew on typically American genres (in particular the American _noir_ and western) as well as Italian _cronaca nera_. Together with a group of young anti-fascist critics (Mario Alicata, Gianni Puccini, Giuseppe De Santis), the well-travelled aristocrat transposed James M. Cain’s 1934 novel _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ to the sweltering flatlands of the Po delta.

Visconti had spent several years in France in the 1930s, where mutual friend Gabrielle ‘Coco’ Chanel had introduced him to Jean Renoir. Informally, Visconti joined Renoir’s troupe as they moved from film to film, culminating in the unfinished short _Partie de campagne_ (1936). A short time later, Renoir was invited to Italy to lecture at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, but the outbreak of World War II forced him to abandon Europe for the US. He left behind a treatment he had written of Cain’s novel and this was the basis of what later became _Ossessione_. In the film, wandering hobo Gino (Massimo Girotti) arrives at a roadside trattoria owned by the harmlessly garrulous Bragana (Juan De Landa). Having set his sights on Bragana’s downtrodden wife Giovanna (Clara Calamai), Gino offers his services as a mechanic in exchange for room and board. Gino and Giovanna soon become lovers and hatch a plan to murder Bragana but, in typically _noir_ fashion, things do not go to plan.

As with Rossellini’s _Rome Open City_, Visconti cast two well-known Italian stars in the film’s main roles. Massimo Girotti had made his international breakthrough as a 21-year-old in Alessandro Blasetti’s historical epic _The Iron Crown_ (1939), and went on to star in Rossellini’s _A Pilot Returns_ (1942). For the role of Giovanna, the director was so determined to cast Anna Magnani that even when the actress told him she was pregnant, he wasn’t deterred. However, production of the film was delayed, meaning that Magnani had to eventually abandon the project. The role went to Clara Calamai, a prominent Italian star of the so-called ‘white telephones’ films of the 1930s and early 1940s. Under Visconti’s remorseless direction, she was completely transformed from glamorous diva to slouched, worn-out adulteress.

From opening scene to pitch-black finale, _Ossessione_ presents a sweat-drenched, earthy alternative to the polish of fascist-approved cinema. Most satisfyingly for the film’s makers, when _Ossessione_ was first shown in September 1943 an outraged Vittorio Mussolini stormed out of the screening, proclaiming ‘This is not Italy!’ Visconti would go on to make a further two features in the neorealist style, finally getting to work with Anna Magnani on 1951’s _Bellissima_.  
**Pasquale Iannone, _Sight and Sound_, May 2013**  

_Ossessione_, made in 1942, when Italy was under Fascist rule, is based on the James Cain novel _The Postman Always Rings Twice_. It is a stunning evocation of sexual passion, far more powerful that either of the American versions of the same story. The first time we see the tramp Gino’s face is the moment he sets eyes on the bar owner’s beautiful young wife, Giovanna. From this meeting, the film, directed by an aristocrat-turned-communist, is near perfect.

The story is told in a brilliantly handled series of triangles. Gino and Giovanna become lovers, with her husband forever between them. Gino attempts to escape once, in a gay partnership with a fellow wanderer. He attempts to escape a second time, after the murder, with a young prostitute. But love closes in around them. As Gino says to Giovanna, ‘Once the world seemed a very big place; now there is only your house.’

‘I am interested in extreme situations,’ Visconti wrote. ‘The instants when abnormal tension reveals the truth about human beings.’ Watching _Ossessione_, I can never get over how quickly we in the audience also come to want Giovanna’s fool of a husband out of the way, how seductive the idea of killing him becomes. And how oppressive the aftermath is, suffocating with guilt and paranoia. The truths of _Ossessione_ are relentlessly hard. Even death, when it comes, contains a cruel trap.

The film itself was made in an extreme situation – cast and crew were grilled by the police, and one of its screenwriters was sent to prison. Despite this, Visconti worked at a pace unimaginable in our commercial cinema, rarely completing more than three shots in a day. Mussolini’s Minister of Culture said it was a film ‘that stinks of latrines’. Thus did the film which launched Neo-Realism begin its ‘tortured existence’. In one town after another it was screened for a night or two before being banned – in one case, the cinema was then exorcised. ‘What would they think,’ wondered Visconti, ‘if they knew this was a film I sold my mother’s jewellery to make?’  
**Frank Deasy, _Sight and Sound_, May 1995**  

**A contemporary review**  
At first glance it is a little remarkable that the best film version of a very well known American novel should have been made in Italy; but only at first glance. For the America of _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ is not that of Mr Marquand’s Boston or Mr Runyon’s New York or even Mr Chandler’s Pacific Coast. Mr Cain’s story is one of which the purely physical aspects of lovemaking, eating and drinking, of which the primitive emotions of lust and jealousy or brutality and murderousness are the very stuff. I don’t wish to malign my beloved Mediterranean countries, but I think that that is why a Latin version was bound to be so good. For good it was, and make no mistake. Visconti’s first film is one of the cinema’s great pieces of work, to which the nearest parallel is probably Feyder’s _Thérèse Raquin_ or Pabst’s _Loves of Jeanne Ney_.

Visconti has placed his characters, all of whom are superbly realised in the round, in a setting of the most admirably convincing and suitable reality. Realism may not be by any means an essential artistic virtue, but in this type of film it is a _sine qua non_, and if it is lacking everything falls to the ground. But the trattoria itself, the surrounding country, the railway trains, the fair at Ancona, the daylong _festa_ at the _trattoria_ one holiday, the host of minor characters, the crowds, are all superlatively real. You can almost smell the garlic and the sweat, taste the harsh red wine and the bowls of minestrone, feel the hot sun on your face and the gritty road underneath your feet. If I were an Italian from Emilia and saw this film abroad, I should break down and cry with sheer homesickness, so real and immediate is the impact.
