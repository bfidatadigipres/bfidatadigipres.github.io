This wide-ranging exploration of the roots, context and legacy of Italian neorealism is the perfect starting point for our two-month long programme. Join season curator Giulia Saccogna together with film critic Christina Newland and academics Professor Richard Dyer and Professor Stephen Gundle for a richly illustrated conversation looking at some of the key figures behind the movement, the newly emerging portrayal of women in Italian cinema in the post-war era, and the stylistic elements and thematic preoccupations that made the movement so influential.

**Richard Dyer** is Professor Emeritus at King’s College London. His books include _Stars_, _White_, _Nino Rota_ and, in the BFI Classics series, _Brief Encounter_, _Se7en_ and _La dolce vita_. _The Richard Dyer Reader_, edited by Glyn Davis and Jaap Kooijman, was published last year.

**Stephen Gundle** teaches film and television studies at the University of Warwick. He has written widely about Italian cinema and cultural history. Among his books are _Bellissima: Feminine Beauty and the Idea of Italy_ (2007), _Mussolini's Dream Factory: Film Stardom in Fascist Italy_ (2013) and _Fame Amid the Ruins: Italian Film Stardom in the Age of Neorealism_ (2020). He is currently directing a collaborative research project on the role of women in the Italian film industry between the 1940s and 1980s.

**Christina Newland** is the lead film critic at the _i_ Newspaper and contributing editor at _Empire Magazine_, with bylines at BBC, Criterion, _Little White Lies_, and many others.

**(Host) Giulia Saccogna** is Programme & Research Coordinator at BFI Southbank and curator of the season ‘Chasing the Real: Italian Neorealism’, running through May and June at BFI Southbank. She previously worked at LFF, BFI Flare and other film festivals in London, as independent curator and in production and distribution of documentaries.
