When I interviewed Martin Scorsese for the October issue of _Sight and Sound_ about _Killers of the Flower Moon_, I took the opportunity to ask for his thoughts on Powell and Pressburger. He’s one of their most impassioned advocates, combining scholarly knowledge and a career-long creative engagement with their oeuvre both together and individually. And in his touching 1991 foreword to Ian Christie’s excellent 1985 book _Arrows of Desire: The Films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger_, Scorsese picks out the one thing above all that makes them such an inspiration: ‘They were the only independent filmmakers who managed to work within the system and still get away with making truly experimental films.’

He is therefore the obvious figure to act as guide in a new documentary, _Made in England: The Films of Powell & Pressburger_. The documentary is directed by David Hinton, who co-directed a charming _South Bank Show_ about Powell in 1986, the year the latter’s eloquent memoir _A Life in Movies_ came out. And Scorsese and Hinton are working in close collaboration with Powell’s widow, the brilliant Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who is committed to making sure the films of Powell and Pressburger continue to find new audiences.

When we meet, the only material still to be shot for the doc is Scorsese’s own appearances. ‘Thelma’s working on certain aspects of clips from certain films,’ he says – and Scorsese has thought deeply about the art of the clip, as the maker of some magnificent documentaries on the cinema, from the epic _A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies_ (1995) to _My Voyage to Italy_ (1999) and _A Letter to Elia_ (2010, co-directed with Kent Jones). ‘It’s very hard to clip these films,’ he says. ‘It’s very hard to clip any film. People want to say too much in the clips and I explain, “No, then what’s the point of seeing the movie?”… I’ve thought about that a great deal… I’m being very, very careful with David and Thelma, saying, “Let’s evoke these films.” The real experience is seeing the film.’

Scorsese’s first encounter with a Powell and Pressburger film came on TV in the late 1940s with the magic of _The Thief of Baghdad_ (1940); and in 1948, when he was just five, as he wrote in _Arrows of Desire_, ‘The first time I recall seeing the Archers’ logo in colour was when my father took me to see _The Red Shoes_ at the Academy of Music on 14th St. I was mesmerised… What I was really drawn to was the mystery of the red shoes, the hysteria of the picture, the extreme close-ups of Moira Shearer’s eyes as she feels herself being borne to her death by the shoes, or is it by herself? This was shocking for me.’ _The Tales of Hoffmann_ (1951) he saw in a hacked-down black-and-white version on a strand called Million Dollar Movie, which gave Powell the title for his second, posthumous, volume of memoirs in 1992. Colour is an intense experience in the Archers’ films, and Scorsese has recalled of _Black Narcissus_ (1947): ‘When I saw their work on screen it was like being bathed in colour, it was palpable.’

Meeting Powell resolved some mysteries, Scorsese recalls. ‘The extraordinary unique thing of their sharing a title was mysterious, to the point where we thought maybe they were pseudonyms for other filmmakers, because there was nothing written on them. We knew Sidney Gilliat and [Frank] Launder, and we also knew the Boulting brothers, but they weren’t the same kinds of films. So these Archer films seemed to be something that from [_The Life and Death of Colonel_] _Blimp_ in the 1970s – which was almost impossible, you couldn’t really see it [until the 1983 restoration, it was only seeable much shortened, in black and white] – to _The Red Shoes_ [1948], and _A Matter of Life and Death_ [1946] as best you could see that too, that was in an edited version… all these films were very, very special. The big productions like _Tales of Hoffmann_, how come we don’t know who made these movies? So that was the mystery until I got to England in ’75, and met Michael.’

The new documentary will investigate the mysteries of that collaboration. ‘It’s a very complex piece. It has to be balanced and it’s interesting, [in the screen credits for a number of their films] it’s “Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.”’ I suggest it’s too easy to take the line that Pressburger wrote the scripts, then Powell rewrote the dialogue and directed them. Scorsese agrees. ‘It’s not that. No, I don’t think it is. And in order to really understand, as best you can, well, first of all, [you can read] the two volumes Michael wrote, and then the volume written on Emeric Pressburger [_Emeric Pressburger: The Life and Death of a Screenwriter_, by his grandson Kevin Macdonald, in 1994]. Then you take a look at the film and I think you get a good sense of it. I think what David has put together is fair and just.

‘I mean, Michael’s directing,’ he continues, ‘but on the other hand, well, Emeric came up with the idea of doing heaven in black and white in _A Matter of Life and Death_. That’s a big, a major contribution.’

After they met in London, Scorsese has recorded elsewhere, Powell saw _Mean Streets_ (1973) and wrote to say ‘how much he liked it – except that I used too much red. “Too much red?” It’s all over his films and that’s where I’d got it from!’ The meeting was the start of a developing friendship. ‘He became part of our lives, he was with us all the time… very close to my parents, pretty much every holiday, birthdays, et cetera, we’d celebrate, screen films from time to time. He was very much part of the family.’ In 1984 Powell married Schoonmaker and the intimacy was even closer for the remaining six years of his life. He admired and supported Scorsese, whom his posthumous memoir calls ‘a real king of the movies’; and he famously wrote the discouraged Scorsese a decisive letter in 1988 urging him to make _GoodFellas_ (1990): ‘It is a stunning script, and will make a wonderful film, and a priceless social document.’

Personally, too, ‘he was a big supporter, particularly in some difficult periods I had in the early 80s – in ’82, trying to finish _King of Comedy_. He was a person who would be able to talk with me in a way that was not judgemental; and had a way of saying things without saying them. As opposed to other people who were, at the time, making declarations and isolating me… I was having a difficult time… But he was pretty much there, in that period, without judgement… or at least he didn’t let me know if he was judging!’ Scorsese laughs at the thought.

When they met, Powell had already been, as he has continued to be, a presence and inspiration in Scorsese’s cinema: there are minor characters called Powell and Pressburger in _Boxcar Bertha_ (1972); Robert De Niro’s Jimmy Doyle signs the hotel register in _New York, New York_ (1977) as ‘Mr. Powell’. The close-ups of Travis Bickle’s face in _Taxi Driver_ (1976) were shot at 36 and 49 frames per second, influenced by the shots of Robert Helpmann in the Venetian duel in _The Tales of Hoffmann_. The build-up to the duel in _Colonel Blimp_ inspired the focus on the rituals of the ring rather than the actual boxing in _Raging Bull_ (1980). Scorsese’s commentary on the Criterion edition of _Black Narcissus_ says the fluency and inventiveness of camera movement and framing of bodies and faces there directly influenced the scene in _The Color of Money_ (1986) in which Tom Cruise is moving round the pool table entering and exiting the frame; and that the handling of Deborah Kerr’s Irish memories inspired the transitions by simple cuts between Rupert Pupkin’s real experience and his fantasy life in _The King of Comedy_ (1982). The trick he learnt from Powell: ‘Treat the fantasy as just as real.’

Scorsese has been thinking about _A Canterbury Tale_ (1944). I mention its extraordinary tone, as a playful pastoral comedy unfolding in Kent just before D-Day: everyone we see doing apparently frivolous things is touched by the war; many of them are about to go off to fight and very possibly die. Scorsese agrees, citing the scene in which Alison (Sheila Sim) sits on the grassy hilltop looking out over Canterbury. ‘_A Canterbury Tale_ is magical. It’s just the music [by Allan Gray] shifting, the shots of the cathedral from afar, as she sits in the grass, the listening to the… here’s the past come up. It’s something worth looking at…what the past means to us in our culture and our lives, and how it speaks to us. That, again, is like the landscape in _Archipelago_ [Joanna Hogg, 2010]. Or the prairies out in Oklahoma, it speaks to you if you shut up and listen. And we did [on _Killers of the Flower Moon_]. Granted I come from Manhattan, but still it said something. I don’t know what the hell it was, but it said it. But in _A Canterbury Tale_, the past speaks to you through the land. It’s beautiful.’
