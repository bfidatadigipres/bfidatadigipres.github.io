_The screening of_ Shoeshine _on Tuesday 14 May will be introduced by season curator Giulia Saccogna._

In the devastation of post-war Rome, two street kids shine shoes to escape starvation. Dreaming to buy a white horse of their own, they naively fall into petty criminality, ending up in a reformatory – a microcosm where their innocence and friendship crumbles. De Sica and Zavattini created a masterpiece of moving visual poetry – a work of painful beauty that owes much to Charles Chaplin and Jean Vigo.

Vittorio De Sica’s _Shoeshine_ is one of the masterpieces of Italian neorealism. De Sica had learnt his trade as an actor, but his box-office hits of the interwar years were films that he was proud and dissatisfied with in equal measure. He began to direct in the early 1940s, and his previous acting experience helped him become an unrivalled coach of non-professional actors. The smooth performance of the two ‘shoeshine’ boys (‘sciuscià’ being the transliteration of the distorted Italian pronunciation of ‘shoeshine’) bears testament to this. Indeed, De Sica seemed to have a particular knack for training young actors. Children carried leading roles in his first serious film, _The Children Are Watching Us_ (_I bambini ci guardano_, 1944), and in the second masterpiece following _Sciuscià_, the legendary _Bicycle Thieves_ (_Ladri di_ biciclette, 1948).

Shot in the squalid desolation of an occupied Italy slowly recovering from the destructions, physical and moral, of a long dictatorship and a humiliating war, _Shoeshine_ is not a political or a socially engaged film like Rossellini’s more conventional and ideologically slanted _Rome Open City_ (1945). The story could not be simpler. Two homeless young boys scrape a living as shoe polishers for the American troops still stationed in Rome. Their involvement in a petty criminal scam lands them in an overcrowded jail, where their friendship is tom apart with tragic consequences. Around this thin plot, loosely based on the stories of real children whom De Sica had actually met, are weaved the dreams and fears of the two protagonists.

The film’s opening scenes of the two children on horseback are powerfully iconic. They perfectly portray the mixture of depressing squalor, open-eyed aspirations and passion for redemption of a whole nation on its knees. Thanks to the help of Cesare Zavattini, Italy’s best scriptwriter of those years, De Sica follows the lives of Giuseppe and Pasquale without ever falling into the trap of producing tear-jerking melodrama. If neorealism is often defined by its use of location shooting and non-professional actors and its exploration of contemporary working-class life, it is also the no-frills, no-preaching realism of films such as _Shoeshine_ that brought a new dimension to world cinema.

Hollywood recognised the greatness of the film and gave it a Special Award Oscar (the predecessor of the foreign-language-film Oscar) for its being ‘proof to the world that the creative spirit can triumph over adversity’. Paradoxically, _Shoeshine_ was more successful abroad since Italy’s cinemas at the time were flooded with the huge backlog of US films boycotted by the Fascists since the late 1930s. Among conservative circles there were also cries of denunciation for the film’s depiction of such an embarrassing image of Italy’s ragged state. Indeed, the most remarkable feature of _Shoeshine_ is its hard-hitting honesty in describing a general state of crisis: even to the 21st-century spectator, the social frescos (the slightly surreal scenes in the jail interiors included) remain striking for the way in which they are warm-hearted and truthfully brutal at one and the same time.
