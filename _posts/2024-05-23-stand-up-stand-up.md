**Momma Don’t Allow**  
In March 1954, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson submitted a proposal to the BFI Experimental Film Fund for a short documentary. At the time, Reisz was working for the BFI as programmer of the National Film Theatre, while Richardson was a young BBC television director. The film, originally titled _Jazz_, was about a Saturday evening in a North London jazz club.

The film was shot on 16mm film during Winter 1954-5 with a total grant of just £425 (the pair had requested only £232). By the time it was completed in November 1955, its title had been changed to _Momma Don’t Allow_.

On 25th January 1956, a few days before the Free Cinema event, _Momma Don’t Allow_ was screened as part of a programme of BFI-funded films for press and industry representatives at the NFT. Press reviews were very encouraging.

_Momma Don’t Allow_ was warmer and more sympathetic to its working-class subjects than Lindsay Anderson’s earlier _O Dreamland_ (1953), which also formed part of the first Free Cinema programme. The film captures the emerging ‘youth culture’– a term unheard of before the 1950s – contrasting the relaxed, confident working-class Teddy Boys and their girlfriends with the more awkward ‘toffs’ whose arrival threatens to change the mood of the evening.

Following _Momma Don’t Allow_, Richardson became increasingly involved in theatre and film production, and never made another Free Cinema film. He was, however, the first of the Free Cinema figures to make the move into feature films, setting up Woodfall Film Productions with playwright John Osborne. Woodfall’s first release was an adaptation of Osborne’s stage hit _Look Back in Anger_ (1959), directed by Richardson.

Reisz was appointed film officer by car manufacturer Ford, which later funded Lindsay Anderson’s _Every Day Except Christmas_ (1957) and Reisz’s own _We Are the Lambeth Boys_ (1959).

**Every Day Except Christmas**  
1956 proved to be a crucial year in Lindsay Anderson’s career. Not only did he initiate the first Free Cinema screening, but he also wrote one of his most passionate theoretical pieces, ‘Stand Up! Stand Up!’ (_Sight and Sound_, Autumn 1956), and he started the production of his new film, _Every Day Except Christmas_.

The new project was made possible because his Free Cinema accomplice Karel Reisz was working for the Ford company. Reisz had accepted the job on condition that he would be allowed to produce a series of non-advertising documentaries. He invited Anderson to make the first film. They started looking for a subject, and when the idea of a film about Covent Garden came up, Anderson spent a few nights following workers around the market.

A very rough treatment was written, but most of the film was improvised on the spot. The material shot over 4 weeks – either through the night or from dawn to lunchtime – was so abundant that Anderson had to persuade the producers to expand the film from the planned 20 minutes to over 40.

_Every Day_ was the centrepiece of the third Free Cinema programme at the National Film Theatre in May 1957. Reviews of the film were almost unanimous in their praise. It went on to win the Grand Prix at the Venice Festival of Shorts and Documentaries later that year. Yet it was Anderson’s last direct contribution to the cinema until his first feature, _This Sporting Life_ in 1963.

The film evokes what Anderson has called the ‘poetry of everyday life’ and has the best lyrical qualities of the wartime films of Anderson’s idol Humphrey Jennings. After a rather cynical view of working-class leisure in _O Dreamland_, Anderson clearly celebrates the virtues and dignity of ordinary people at work. The film makes perfect use of Free Cinema’s trademark features: virtuoso cinematography alternating highly poetic moments with candid camera shots, and an imaginative soundtrack using natural sounds, voices and added music. This time though, Anderson added a voice-over commentary as a concession to the sponsor.

_Every Day Except Christmas_ was one of the most ambitious of all Free Cinema films, and remains probably the best representative of the movement in retrospectives around the world today.

**March to Aldermaston**  
1958’s Easter march to Aldermaston enjoys landmark status in the annals of peaceful protest. Its filmed record is similarly recalled as a milestone for campaigning documentary.

CND emerged from Aldermaston as a campaign uniting disparate wings of the political left with otherwise apolitical concerned citizens. Echoing this, the volunteers responsible for the film, under the Film and Television Committee for Nuclear Disarmament, united different sectors of their industry: from lab technicians processing footage for free, to Contemporary Films, which handled its distribution. The involvement of Free Cinema practitioners Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz is noteworthy, but this is not a Free Cinema film. Equally important were the contributions of contemporaries outside that movement (such as the Committee’s Secretary Derrick Knight, and Stephen Peet) and others (like Wolfgang Suschitzky) with roots in the older Documentary Movement.

Credited only to the Committee, _March to Aldermaston_ demands appreciation as the product of selfless collaboration. By most accounts, however, Anderson came to dominate the film at the editing stage. The crisp documentary shaped from the miles of raw footage is amazingly coherent. With the crucial addition of Richard Burton sensitively reading Christopher Logue’s commentary, it is succinct and moving, never hysterical or sentimental. Courageously, it does not flinch from criticising the Eastern Bloc as harshly as Western politicians. And, in documenting the march’s generally middle-class demographics (despite attempts to portray the movement as more broadly-based), it’s now a great period piece, awash with cut-glass accents, trad jazz, and sensible hats and coats.

Precisely because it deserves recognition as a sincere attempt to advance its cause through documentary, it deserves the respect of being asked tough questions. It echoes the weaknesses, as much as the strengths, of the disarmament movement. Politically, CND influenced only the Labour Party - mainly to Labour’s electoral detriment. It soon caused damaging divisions within the party and, as late as 1983, Aldermaston veteran Michael Foot’s landslide defeat was widely blamed on Labour’s anti-nuclear platform. The film, too, fails to mount a convincing case for unilateral disarmament (its best shot is the claim that Britain can set a powerful moral example, arguably reflecting a dated faith in the UK’s international influence). It no doubt had an electrifying effect at campaign meetings, but was less likely to win over the undecided, if it even reached them. Like too many other campaigning films, _March To Aldermaston_ is ultimately a feel-good film for activists.

**O Dreamland**  
Lindsay Anderson’s _O Dreamland_ was made in 1953, around the same time as Anderson was making his Oscar-winning documentary _Thursday’s Children_, co-directed with Guy Brenton. Anderson had just one assistant – John Fletcher, who was to be a mainstay of the Free Cinema films. Equipment was a single 16mm camera and an audiotape recorder.

Once completed, the film was shelved, with little prospect of ever being shown. As Anderson said, ‘you don’t do anything with a 10-minute, 16-millimetre film. It’s just there, that’s all.’ It wasn’t until early 1956, when the idea for the first Free Cinema programme was born, that it occurred to Anderson to include  
_O Dreamland_.

This is one of the most personal of the Free Cinema films. A 12-minute tour of the Margate funfair Dreamland (which still stands – in disrepair – today), the film features bleak and unattractive photography and a spare and impressionistic soundtrack. Despite the absence of a commentary, the film clearly conveys Anderson’s critical view of Dreamland’s ‘attractions’ – a ‘Torture through the Ages’ exhibit; bingo; penny arcades; bangers, beans and chips and seemingly endless mechanical puppets.

The lack of commentary was a characteristic of the Free Cinema films, as was the absence of live sound. This was initially forced on the filmmakers by the costs involved in synchronised sound, but the financial constraints freed Anderson and his colleagues to be creative and to use sound in expressive ways: a feature of _O Dreamland_’s soundtrack is the recurring laughter of the mechanical dummies, which takes on a sinister, mocking tone.

The effect of _O Dreamland_ is summed-up by Gavin Lambert in his article on Free Cinema:

‘Everything is ugly... It is almost too much. The nightmare is redeemed by the point of view, which, for all the unsparing candid camerawork and the harsh, inelegant photography, is emphatically humane. Pity, sadness, even poetry is infused into this drearily tawdry, aimlessly hungry world.’
