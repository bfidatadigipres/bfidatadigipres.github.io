**‘The Pleasure Garden’: contemporary reviews**  
This light extravaganza by the Californian poet James Broughton, whose 16mm films (_Mothers’ Day_, _Loony Tom_, etc.) have been seen over here, was financed by private subscription and shot entirely on location in the Crystal Palace Gardens, a perfect setting. It is a highly personal mixture of lyricism, mime, whimsy and caprice; some may find it too tenuous, but those who like it will like it very much indeed. It has a freedom all too rare in the cinema, and it is all freshly, unassumingly imagined: a real, a genuine lark. Professional and non-professional actors blend homogeneously under the director’s eccentric guidance, Stanley Bate’s music is full of entirely appropriate gaiety and invention, and Walter Lassally’s photography is resourceful and attractively framed. _The Pleasure Garden_ won the Prix de Fantaisie Poetique at Cannes, 1954.  
**_Monthly Film Bulletin_, November 1954**  

He comes to London. He shows his films. He offers to make a film here, engages support, opens a subscription list, makes his film, and here it is.

The name of this prodigy is James Broughton. He’s that rare bird, a poet-cineaste. Rare? We all, in our better moments, and in recoil from what the screen manufactures, envisage some such film as _The Pleasure Garden_. This is the small, valuable, personal thing; that, the shoddy goods. We should, given the money and opportunity, do what Broughton has done. But we don’t. We lack the talent and the persuasion-and don’t let’s underestimate the latter without which _The Pleasure Garden_ would be out of the question.

My delight that this piece should have arrived, and will in time take its place in repertoire, hasn’t, I hope, distracted me from the film itself. This is fresh as a daisy. As I’ve said, Broughton is a poet, a larky poet whose verses trip with an Elizabethan feeling and a modern vernacular. As the Elizabethan poet tended to compose his own music and to stage masques, so Broughton makes films. His larkiness finds there an added advantage: what the camera sees is so very literal to a poetic eye. In Chaplin, in René Clair, Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati we enjoy on a big scale the fruits of the poetic turned comic. Broughton is of their kind – his _Pleasure Garden_ has much in common with _Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday_ – except that he holds more strongly to feeling, makes short cuts they daren’t, sees and sings out of himself, and never dilutes a joke or a movement. _The Pleasure Garden_ thus combines, so far as we are concerned, the pleasures of Keystone with the love lyric. He takes a public garden (the Crystal Palace gardens, fallen into beautiful disrepair), and leads there the love-hungry young; they measure themselves against the statues, crash on bicycles into bushes, thaw in top-hats to an unusual music. The bandstand stages a chaste ballet, to the accompaniment of an intense female doublebass player, who at the end clasps her instrument and wanders off through the shrubbery. Of course there are funereal officials to put an end to all larks, and a Good (and fat) Fairy who, brushing away, crumbs as she comes out of a fish-and-chip shop, will wave her wand to some effect over those within and without the bounds of temptation.

Does this all sound self-conscious fun? It is not. It springs like the lark, and mingles oddity, grace, satire, and laughter without a dead moment. If the fault of Broughton’s earlier pieces was that they were private, here he triumphs by being personal in a way we can all understand and enjoy. Cinemas would be gayer if he could be banged into as many programmes, before as many audiences, as possible.  
**William Whitebait, _Sight and Sound_, January/March 1954**  

**Lorenza Mazzetti on ‘Together’**  
Of the four original signatories to the Free Cinema manifesto, Lorenza Mazzetti has all but slipped from the pages of film history. Mazzetti was brought up by her aunt and uncle in Florence after her parents died when she was very young. Following a traumatic war – the SS killed her aunt and cousins; her uncle later committed suicide – she moved to London in the early 50s where she studied at the Slade School of Art. There she directed her first film – a short 16mm version of Kafka’s _Metamorphosis_ – and soon afterwards was given money by the BFI Experimental Film Fund (which backed many of the Free Cinema shorts) to make _Together_. Returning to Italy in 1959, she settled in Rome and directed a few television programmes for RAI. In 1961 she published a novel, _The Sky Falls_, based on her childhood (the memoir became a popular film in Italy last year). She lived in Rome [until her death in 2020], where she owned a puppet theatre.

_What was your first experience as a filmmaker?_

I knew Slade’s film society had a small 16mm camera, some film and lights, so I decided to make a filmed version of Kafka’s _Metamorphosis_. As the college was full of very interesting characters, I asked one of my student friends to play Gregorio Samsa and two others to play his mother and sister. But I had no one to play Samsa’s boss until I met a fur dealer in the street. It was lucky he accepted the part because we had no money and he had to feed us more than once during the shoot. Then I edited the film in my bedroom, asked my friend Danièle Paris, an avant-garde composer, to contribute the music and had the film printed in a lab in Grosvenor Street, instructing them to charge the school. When William Coldstream received the bill, he told me, ‘My dear Lorenza, either you pay the bill or you go to jail. But since I don’t really want you to go to jail, I’ll let you organise a screening in the school and charge the students. If the screening’s successful enough to pay off your debts, then the film will be officially produced by the Slade. If it’s not, then the police will be waiting for you at the end.’ Eventually the film was so well received Coldstream introduced me to Denis Forman, the director of the BFI, who said he could help me make another film. The day after, we had tea together and I showed him a four-page synopsis of a film then titled _The Glass Marbles_.

_How did the project become_ Together _?_

I had serious psychological problems because of my past, but as no one knew about it, the only way to express my anxiety was to translate it unconsciously into a film script. My film was about two deaf-mutes who lived in the East End and were completely excluded from the world around them. I’d projected my own feelings of being different on to these characters, who were constantly followed by a group of children who shouted things they couldn’t hear. As time went by the children became more and more daring until one of the deaf-mutes suddenly rebelled.

Forman liked the idea a lot and told me to find my actors and start filming. I chose Michael Andrews – then a fine art student – to be one of the main characters and then I called sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi, whom I’d met earlier at an art gallery, to ask him to take the other leading role. The cinematographer was a young Egyptian, Hamid Hadari, who’d shot the Kafka film, with some additional photography by Walter Lassally.

At the same time I met Denis Horne, who’d been at Oxford where he’d known Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson, and I immediately fell in love with him. I asked him to co-direct the film but the script he wrote had lots of dialogue and what I really wanted was silence. We argued a lot and he wanted to direct the film on his own, but Paolozzi said, ‘Either Lorenza directs it or I’m off.’ So I finished the film alone. Denis couldn’t accept that I was becoming more famous than him. It traumatised me so much that a few years later, when Anderson, Reisz and Richardson offered to produce another project of mine, I asked if Denis could come along. But they said they wanted me alone and I lost my last chance to make a film in Britain.

_How did you finish the film on your own?_

After Denis left I started to cut the film in a cutting room owned by the BFI in the middle of the countryside. As I was experiencing many difficulties, Forman asked Lindsay Anderson to give me a hand. Lindsay saw the film, liked it and decided to help me to edit it and work on the soundtrack with John Fletcher. Danièle Paris came all the way from Rome to compose some of the music and we added a few traditional English songs. By then Lindsay had become a good friend.

_Had you seen his_ Thursday’s Children _before he helped you to finish_ Together _?_

No I hadn’t. I didn’t even know who he was. He showed me a few issues of his film magazine _Sequence_ and then screened _O Dreamland_. He was a fascinating, tenderly rude and grumpy man. His enthusiasm made me fall in love with everything.

_Why did you choose London’s East End as a location for your film?_

When I arrived in the East End I was shocked by the landscape, the atmosphere, and I thought I should film the people who lived in this world. It was like a ready-made film set. The people’s difficulty in expressing themselves, in communicating, overwhelmed me. But I found their reserve and genuine kindness extremely moving.

_How was your relationship with your actors?_

We were very close. Andrews was extremely shy but he always understood immediately what I expected of him. It was never necessary to tell either him or Paolozzi what to do.

_What happened between finishing your film and the first Free Cinema screening?_

One day – it must have been in January 1956 – Lindsay came to see me in the Kitchen Soup café on Charing Cross Road where I was working as a waitress. We sat at a table and he said, ‘I talked about your film to my friends Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson. It turns out that your film has the same qualities, the same objectives and the same political agenda as ours. We’d like to show our three films together and write a manifesto.’ So we started writing the manifesto on that table in the Kitchen Soup.

Some time later I was introduced to Reisz and Richardson. Then, on 5 February 1956, Lindsay told me, ‘Come on, you’ve got to come with us to the NFT.’ The four of us were very nervous about the whole thing and it got even worse when we saw the long queue of film enthusiasts waiting outside. Eventually all went well and the reviews in the papers the next day were very flattering. Film critic Dilys Powell spoke of ‘White Hopes’ in the _Sunday Times_.

_What was your relationship with the so-called Angry Young Men group?_

I met John Osborne at Tony Richardson’s place. He was a charming man. After the success of the first Free Cinema screening it became evident that London was ready for something completely new.
