Long fascinated with Anderson’s place in British film and television, and praised for his film about Anderson’s relationship with Richard Harris, artist and filmmaker Stephen Sutcliffe is brilliantly well placed to craft an Experimenta Mixtape about the tensions, contexts and opportunities that flowed through Anderson’s life and work. As ever with the Mixtapes, no other information is provided in advance. Expect a richly provocative collage of highly textured film extracts, TV shows, and surprises from a tape compilation master.

**Stephen Sutcliffe** (b.1968, Harrogate) is an artist who lives and works in the UK. Recent solo exhibitions include, Künstlerhaus Stuttgart (2019), Talbot Rice Edinburgh, Hepworth Wakefield (2017), Rob Tufnell, London (2015), Tramway, Glasgow (2013). In 2018 he participated in the Manchester International Festival in collaboration with Graham Eatough on a film for the Whitworth Gallery, for which they won the Contemporary Arts Society Award. He has been shortlisted for the Jarman Award twice and in 2012 he won the Margaret Tait Award. In 2019 he had two books published, _at Fifty_ (Sternberg Press) a monograph and _Much Obliged_ (Book Works) a kind of autobiography. In 2019 he curated an exhibition of items from the Herbert Read Archive at the Brotherton Library in Leeds University with the arts group Pavillion, which was accompanied by a new video, _City of Dreadful Something_.

**William Fowler** is Curator of Artists’ Moving Image at the BFI National Archive where he acquires, restores and curates films and co-founded BFI Flipside. His projects have included _Queer Pagan Punk: Derek Jarman_, the largest ever UK retrospective of Jarman’s films; _This Is Now: Film and Video After Punk_ which toured internationally in collaboration with artist moving image agency LUX and included over twenty restorations; and most recently the restoration of films by Lorenza Mazzetti which in January played at MoMA, New York. In 2023, he co-curated the Raven Row gallery show _People Make Television,_ a major retrospective on open-access community TV. His co-authored book _The Bodies Beneath: The Flipside of British Film and Television_ is available from Strange Attractor Press.
