Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) works as a lowly IT programmer, leading a double-life as a hacker at night, under the alias ‘Neo’. One night he is visited by a group of rebels led by charismatic seer Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who imparts a shattering revelation about life as we know it, and seeks to recruit Neo to fight evil forces at work.

Rising to the reality-bending potential of their premise, writer-directors the Wachowski sisters pushed computer-generated imagery to stage gravity-defying fight sequences between Neo and the Matrix’s black-suited villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).

Alongside its breathtaking spectacle, the film also tapped into contemporary philosophical unease about our over-mediated perception of reality, with radical thinkers such as Jean Baudrillard referenced in the smart screenplay.

**A contemporary review**  
The Wachowski wrote and sold the script for _The Matrix_ before they made their first film, the mesmerizing crime thriller _Bound_. They have since reported that between comic-book conception (a spin-off from their work at Marvel on the _Hellraiser_ stories) and production go-ahead, ‘the script that nobody understands’ underwent considerable fine-tuning, thanks to studio insistence on explanatory dialogue. Even so, for a breathlessly vertiginous first quarter _The Matrix_ scorns offering any rationale behind its attention-grabbing assaults and chases, leaving only its peevish spokesperson to mutter legitimate protests on our behalf (‘This is insane! Why is it happening to me? What did _I_ do?’) until reasonably concluding he must be half-asleep. At which point, naturally, he falls into the grasp of Morpheus.

The Wachowskis are good at names, as they demonstrated with the title and main trio of _Bound_: Corky (buoyant), Violet (clinging) and Caesar (dictatorial). Conjuring up a flock of evocations – Cypher, Tank, Switch, Apoc, Mouse – for _The Matrix_, they invest the film’s gradually uncovered crusade with a rich blend of messianic implications blatantly signaled by warrior priestess Trinity. Her unifying presence links – and exchanges – the powers of Morpheus the dream-master with those of the long-sought savior Neo (note the anagram) who is at once the New Man (as in, by useful coincidence, Neo-Tokyo, subsumed by _Akira_) and the neophyte disciple.

More squarely, the film is an ironic rereading of _Logan’s Run_ (1976), with a not to _Soylent Green_ (1973) and more than a dash of _Zardoz_ (1973). The Wachowskis unveil a seedy utopia where mankind is preserved, protected and endlessly recycled by its own mega-computer. The alternative to this artificial stasis is, as usual, well beyond the wit of mortal proles. Necessarily, _The Matrix_ ends much where it started, its newborn visionary poised – like Logan or _2001_’s Starchild or _THX 1138_’s hero or even like Luke Skywalker (prime exponent of the ‘Why me?’ syndrome) – on the brink of literally unimaginable new benefits. Away from the meddlesome tyranny of the machine, the superhero will be in charge. There’s always One.

The retrospect is less than reassuring and the Wachowskis don’t hide their misgivings. Played by Keanu Reeves with a certain gloomy helplessness, Neo gives a good impression of being incapable of original thought (he is, after all, as programmed as any Matrix slave) and little sign of inspiring social reform. But two voices speak loudly and persuasively on behalf of the Matrix: the traitorous terrorist Cypher celebrates it for colourful comforts unmatched by the drab post-apocalyptic real world; and the fearsome man-in-black humanoid Agent Smith (not quite Winston Smith, but the Wachowskis, recognising an affinity, have mischievously appended a Room 101) spells out its evolutionary task by dismissing humans as ‘a plague – and we are the cure’. The same dispassionate logic was prologue to _The Terminator_ and more recently at the core of _Virus_.

But if the Wachowskis claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method. As with _Bound_, the film is a feast of unexpected fidgets and perspectives, punctuated by trademark overhead shots and teasing detail and detour, such as the squeal of washed windows as Neo is reprimanded by his boss, or the White Rabbit subtext culminating in a glimpse of _Night of the Lepus_ (1972) on a television. Just as in _Bound_, telephones play a vital role, while the fetishistic use of shades and black leather tells yet another story, encompassing Smith’s chipped lens and Neo’s triumphal final outfit. Primarily, _The Matrix_ is a wonderland of tricks and stunts, light years from Kansas, combining computerised slow-motion with the extravagant choreography of martial-arts movies to create a broadside of astonishing images. As Neo turns cartwheels, blazing away behind wildly exploding décor, it seems clear that the Wachowskis have discovered a gleeful utopia of their own.
