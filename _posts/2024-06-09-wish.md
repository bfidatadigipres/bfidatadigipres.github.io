**What’s it about?**  

The people of Rosas offer up their wishes for protection by their magical king. When young Asha seeks work at the king’s palace, she stumbles across a disturbing secret that threatens the very foundation of her world. Released as Disney Studios celebrated their 100th anniversary, Wish nods to the great animated films of the studio’s illustrious past.<br>

**‘Be careful what you wish for!’**  
Walt Disney Animation Studios’ all-new musical comedy _Wish_ invites audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force – a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe – the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico – to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actress Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as King Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s pet goat Valentino, the epic animated musical _Wish_  hits the big screen as the storied studio marks 100 years of moviemaking.

Inspired by Walt Disney’s magical, musical legacy, the movie features an original story and characters, with seven all-new songs penned by Grammy®-nominated singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer-songwriter-musician Benjamin Rice. But perhaps this film’s biggest nod to the Disney legacy is in the title itself: _Wish_. Whether it’s Geppetto looking up at the stars and wishing for his wooden Pinocchio to become a real boy, Tiana gazing at the night sky as she dreams of owning her own business, or Moana turning to the stars in her quest to save her island, so many of Disney’s most beloved characters are defined by their dreams. _Wish_ celebrates that kind of passion. ‘At the heart of our film is this: “There is no greater power in the universe than someone with a true wish in their heart”,’ says the film’s screenwriter-executive producer Jennifer Lee (_Frozen_,  _Frozen 2_), who also serves as the studio’s chief creative officer. ‘It really is a film about understanding that with great wishes often comes greater struggle. Hopefully, it’s aspirational on how to persevere.’
