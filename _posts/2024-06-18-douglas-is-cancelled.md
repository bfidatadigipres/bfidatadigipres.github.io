_+ Q&A with cast Hugh Bonneville and Karen Gillan, writer Steven Moffat, executive producer Sue Vertue and director/executive producer Ben Palmer_

Written by globally renowned screenwriter Steven Moffat (_Doctor Who_, _Sherlock_), _Douglas Is Cancelled_ introduces us to middle-aged current affairs news anchor Douglas Bellowes. Behind the scenes, Douglas needs constant reassurance from his younger, tech-savvy, social-media-aware co-anchor, Madeline. A national treasure, he can seemingly do no wrong, until he makes an ill-advised joke at his cousin’s wedding. During the on-going digital storm, Douglas’s alleged indiscretion is blown out of all proportion and he struggles to escape the controversy. In this chaotic and increasingly unmanageable situation, can Douglas count on the support of his agent and colleagues?

Additionally, Gillan leads Lisa Steen’s coming-of-age drama feature _Late Bloomers_, which premiered at SXSW in 2023 where it was nominated for the narrative feature Grand Jury Award before being acquired by Vertical Entertainment.

His numerous awards include BAFTAs for _Press Gang_ and _Doctor Who_, two BAFTAs and two Emmys for _Sherlock,_ and the BAFTA Special Award in 2012. In 2015 he was created an OBE for services to drama.

**Sue Vertue** is CEO and executive producer at Hartswood Films. She began her career at Tiger Aspect in 1991 with _Mr Bean_.
