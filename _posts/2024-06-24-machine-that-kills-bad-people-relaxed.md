Rossellini’s beguiling neorealist comedy proposes a sharp satire on human behaviour. Engaging us in people-watching from the start, he creates a detailed and authentic portrait of life in a small fishing village. When a photographer discovers that his camera has special powers, he also learns that with power comes responsibility. Join us after the screening to reflect upon the film through a neurodivergent lens.

The post screening discussion will be hosted by campaigner and creative Leo Capella.
