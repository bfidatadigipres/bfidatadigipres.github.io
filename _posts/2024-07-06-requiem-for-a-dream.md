Darren Aronofsky’s _Requiem for a Dream_ is as bravura a display of filmmaking as you’re likely to see; an exhibition of poised expressionist swagger beside which the pyrotechnics of David Fincher seem positively bromidic. In print its visual flourishes may sound ostentatious: split screens, acceleration then deceleration, fades to white, title cards, demonic fridges and Coney Island dreamscapes. Even that old John Frankenheimer favourite the fish-eye lens takes a bow 60 minutes in.

But it works. And it keeps on working, pounding and whirring into hard proof of a singular _cinematic_ talent unafraid to experiment yet prepared to borrow from past iconoclasts. Which, when the comically pompous opening shot of Bruno Dumont’s _L’Humanité_ can be referred to as a pivotal image in contemporary film, couldn’t be better timed.

Of course, the usual term for such aesthetic grandstanding is MTV filmmaking, a put-down routinely applied to anyone under 40 who does more than point the camera at the actors. In this context it’s a criticism rendered obsolete by the sheer breadth of Aronofsky’s direction with its brave juxtaposition of visual audacity and the horrific (but essentially everyday) descent of its subjects. Yet there is a certain precision musicality to Aronofsky’s film, a rhythmic pulse which echoes his protagonists’ relentless decline. In a recurrent motif he strips down the mechanics of drug use to their fundamentals: a needle is filled; a bank note rolled; a television switched on. Blood vessels expand, pupils dilate. Cut, after cut, after cut, after cut. On one level it’s an inspired technical fancy, the scratch and rewind of rap translated to celluloid. On another it’s a stark insight into the blank lab-rat cycle of addiction.

In other words, Aronofsky’s razzle-dazzle serves to articulate his themes. Except this articulacy isn’t confined to his box of tricks; there’s as much loaded eloquence in scenes as gracefully minimal as a weary Jennifer Connelly standing before a mirror until a cocaine rush (bill rolled, line chopped, eyes wide) literally elevates her, her arms high above her head like a ballerina. It should go without saying that, given the egregiously talkative nature of the modem American indie movie, such fluency is a godsend.

It’s also a hugely significant evolution in Aronofsky’s filmmaking after the monochrome zeal of his feature debut _Pi_. There, potent though the end result was, the image was the _raison d’être_, the point the shock of the new as seen through the eyes of a migraine-suffering genius-obsessive (exemplified by a brain quivering on a dank subway platform). Here, the visual authority is as likely to come from the director’s increasingly vivid eye for the mundane details that punctuate even the most hellish of trajectories: a paper plane floating to earth, a conversation between hospital porters, a phone number scrawled on the back of a photograph, a tear welling above a bulwark of mascara.

Of course, one important practical distinction between Aronofsky’s debut and his follow-up is that whereas the narrative coherence of _Pi_ was often at the mercy of its visual sensibilities, _Requiem_ is founded on a concrete storyline (adapted from Hubert Selby Jr’s 1978 novel), a classic three-act morality tale right down to its title cards. Much of the credit for that belongs to Selby, but it’s Aronofsky’s refusal to marginalise Ellen Burstyn’s lonely Coney Island mom Sara Goldfarb in favour of the more overtly romantic trio of her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) and friend Ty (Marlon Wayans) that truly fires the film; to have done otherwise would both have confirmed the conventional wisdom that young male directors are only happy dealing with young male subjects and sabotaged the denouement.

Alongside his film’s ferocious stylisation Aronofsky develops a genuine empathy with his characters, granting them substantial interior lives without recourse to having them explain ‘how they feel’. And for a director accused in the US of seeing his cast as little more than meat puppets, he does a fine job of coaxing some sublime performances from his principals. By the film’s bitter conclusion I felt a deeper attachment to all four of Aronofsky’s supposed ciphers than I did to anyone in _Magnolia_ after three hours plus of Paul Thomas Anderson’s sprawling opus. And I liked _Magnolia_. Without such a connection, the film’s infernal final third would be a mere exercise in guignol; as it is, it’s a brutal but unforgettable kick in the chest. And, for an audience dizzy with the slack-jawed irony of modem US cinema, a shot in the arm.

Which brings us, glibly enough, to heroin. In the US, where its reception bordered on outrage, one of the more enthusiastic notices described Aronofsky as having made the ‘definitive skag movie’. And it’s certainly true that _Requiem for a Dream_ has a far clearer grip on opiate compulsion than such ostensible peers as Gus Van Sant’s prettified _Drugstore Cowboy_ or the empty fripperies of _Trainspotting_. The proximity of smack to the spine of the narrative was always going to give Aronofsky problems: wallow in grimly prosaic junkiedom and you’ve got another tedious, repellent _Christiane F._; airbrush reality and the spectre of _The Basketball Diaries_ rears its glossy, pouting head.

Certainly, Aronofsky goes with sexy young faces for three-quarters of his cast, with the attendant risk of reviving heroin chic. But with heroin chic the glazed nonchalance of the models is exactly that, a profound indifference to anything beyond artifice; in _Requiem for a Dream_ it’s all about anaesthesia trying to kill a pain that won’t die. While Connelly and Leto initially make an exquisite couple, their gently wasted allure only adds to the pathos when their worlds cave in. Beauty, to Aronofsky, doesn’t fade so much as fall apart. Throw in the septicaemia that dominates much of the film’s closing stages and chic seems a long way away.

In any case, heroin itself is irrelevant in the face of the film’s overriding theme: the need for an escape, for over the rainbow, and the cataclysms that await as a consequence. In _Requiem for a Dream_ that can mean anything from the ‘pound of pure’ Harry and Ty never quite catch sight of to Marion’s lust for independence or – most poignantly of all – Sara’s visions of being needed again. And here Aronofsky deserves every plaudit for never condescending to the apparently tawdry dreams of a dilapidated old woman desperate to appear as a ‘winner’ on a television infomercial where there are no winners, only salesmen.

Ultimately Aronofsky’s concern is not with junkies, cokeheads or tragic Jewish mothers but with the gaping universal psychic wounds that Hollywood merely dresses with plastic redemption. Like staring into the sun (as a young boy did in _Pi_) or into the abyss (as Aronofsky does here), _Requiem for a Dream_ won’t let you look away the same person. For that, we should be grateful.
