**SPOILER WARNING The following notes give away some of the plot.**

Andrzej Zulawski’s first and only English-language feature was originally released in the UK in 1982, around a year after its Cannes competition premiere. Though it lost to _Man of Iron_ (by Zulawski’s former mentor Andrzej Wajda), it picked up a best actress award for Isabelle Adjani’s primal shriek of a performance as Anna, whose sudden, unexplained decision to walk out on husband Mark (Sam Neill) jump-starts the rollercoaster that follows.

This cut little ice with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who ludicrously included it on the official ‘video nasties’ blacklist compiled in the wake of one of the more virulent moral panics to which British officialdom occasionally falls prey. While this was undoubtedly a badge of honour for most of its shoddy companions, it did _Possession_ a major disservice, though it’s fitting that a film so full of paranoia, oppression and surveillance (it’s set in Cold War Berlin, Mark’s job seems espionage-related, two detectives meet decidedly sticky ends) should itself fall victim to similarly irrational emotions – and, in the US, severe mutilation, losing more than a third of the original running time. It’s worth noting en passant that the BBFC never had a problem with it, passing it uncut on three separate occasions, including the theatrical release that preceded the legal threats.

Although it’s easy to see why it was pigeonholed as a horror film, its first half presents what is still one of the most viscerally vivid portraits of a disintegrating relationship yet committed to film, comfortably rivalling Lars von Trier’s _Antichrist_, David Cronenberg’s _The Brood_ and Ingmar Bergman’s _Scenes from a Marriage_. When Anna leaves, Mark runs the gamut of grief responses, going berserk in a café (crockery-smashing, chair-throwing) before shivering on a bed in a cold sweat as though undergoing cold turkey. After he attempts to assault her combat-trained lover Heinrich (Heinz Bennent), there’s a doomed attempt at reconciliation that sees Mark and Anna take turns to mutilate themselves with an electric carving knife.

Like Bergman and Cronenberg, Zulawski was dealing with very personal demons: he’d just undergone a psychologically traumatic divorce from his first wife, actress Malgorzata Braunek. At one point, Mark sticks a feather down his throat to induce vomiting, and Zulawski seems to have done something similar when conceiving the film, spewing out every raw emotion that he could recall. These are uncomfortable scenes to watch, partly because there’s a child involved (the real-life equivalent of Anna and Mark’s ten-year-old son Bob grew up to be director Xawery Zulawski who, on the evidence of _Chaos_ and _Snow White and Russian Red_, is very much his father’s son) but mainly thanks to the pervasive impression that Zulawski is grabbing us by the scruff of the neck and rubbing our faces in private grief. The camera constantly tracks and circles the couple as though possessed by a pathological voyeurism – camera operator Andrzej Jaroszewicz achieves effects comparable to the Steadicam work in _The Shining_ but with far more limited resources.

The film’s second half is what earned it lasting notoriety, as it involves Adjani shacking up in a dilapidated apartment to pursue a relationship with a tentacular monstrosity that seems to have erupted from her own id, possibly via a spectacular five-minute freakout in an underpass. In fact, despite its love of human flesh (both living – Adjani’s – and recently killed), the creature is marginally less repellent than the unctuous Heinrich, who still lives with his mother despite apparently being a one-man _Kama Sutra_. Its precise function is never made clear – a physical embodiment of the notion that the disintegration of the family breeds monsters? A writhing surrogate for the dark and twisted secrets underpinning even the most outwardly healthy marriage? A recurring doppelgänger motif (Mark and Anna have clones of unspecified origin, physically identical but temperamentally opposite) is also left unexplained, but _Possession_ is self-evidently far more than just another monster movie. Those prepared to make the leap of faith demanded by Zulawski’s ultra-confrontational, deliriously overwrought, symbol-crammed approach will find the experience, like that of Ken Russell’s equally maligned _The Devils_, very hard to forget.  
**Michael Brooke, _Sight and Sound_, November 2010**

The common negative view of Zulawski’s cinema was that his plots were wilfully baffling, that his camerawork was too florid, that he encouraged his actors to emote and gesticulate as if in some continual state of paroxysm. But this was an entirely superficial impression. Underlying the heightened nature of the films was a deep, questioning soulfulness related to literary antecedents coupled with a vision of cinema open to shifting levels of perception and fantasy.

For many years his only film to have had any kind of impact in Britain was _Possession_, shot in English in a divided Berlin in 1980, which even achieved the distinction of being briefly classified as a ‘video nasty’. Described by its director as a ‘fairy tale for adults’, it was born from two impulses: the director’s return to Poland after a period abroad to find his son alone in a flat and his wife elsewhere; and a viewing of Bergman’s _Scenes from a Marriage_, which Zulawski felt had no fruitful conclusion.

In his vision of a marital break-up, the protagonist (Sam Neil) discovers his wife (Isabelle Adjani) to have acquired not only a preposterous lover but also to have conjured up a monster which she visits for sexual gratification. Doppelgängers proliferate and the crises build to an apocalyptic ending. Is it psychological drama, or a horror film? Zulawski in effect created a genre of his own, while following a path that has also been trod – to greater acceptance – by David Cronenberg and David Lynch, filmmakers happy to twist narratives in unexpected ways and make the viewer become anything but passive.

In 1980 Isabelle Adjani won an award at Cannes for _Possession_, but not before having been so shocked by her viewing of the film to the point of attempting suicide. Zulawski’s method of working with actors had evolved out of watching the experimental theatre work of Jerzy Grotowski, as well as trips he made to Haiti to witness voodoo rites. He would admit to putting his cast – especially actresses, who he believed needed to be liberated from themselves – under trances to prepare them for their scenes.
