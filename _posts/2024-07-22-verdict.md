**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Some 25 Years on from _12 Angry Men_ Sidney Lumet returned to the drama of the court room and provided Paul Newman with his most vulnerable role. Newman is the alcoholic lawyer seeking to salvage his career and self-respect by taking a medical malpractice case to trial rather than settling. _The Verdict_ is a courtroom drama that plays like a sports film, but Lumet and screenwriter David Mamet invariably recognise the human side of corruption and criminality as well as redemption.

**A contemporary review**  
For a film with such clear-cut ethical concerns, with the need to bring both medicine and the law to book for their respective malpractices, _The Verdict_ is remarkably suffused with the motifs and atmosphere of the religious. This does have a local justification in that the setting is a Catholic archdiocese of Boston, and one of the parties to the legal dispute, St Catherine’s Hospital, where a young woman is rendered comatose by the anaesthetic she is given during labour, is run by the church. But this is not _True Confessions_, the interpenetration of the sacred and the profane is not a theme, and the film draws little irony from the bishop’s hard-headed calculations about an out-of-court settlement. A sacerdotal mood is unmistakeable, however, from the film’s title (which is not as matter-of-fact as it sounds, but synonymous with ‘the judgment’) to its very first shot, a slow zoom into Paul Newman’s burnt-out ambulance chaser playing pinball in a bar,

With its first cut, the film then jumps to a Bressonian play of hands as Frank Galvin peels a bill from a wad of notes, paying off the director of a funeral home before entering to proffer his services to the mourners. Clearly, the religious dimension belongs most to Galvin, as he gradually realises that he can win redemption by taking a case that is brought to him as a favour, a medical malpractice suit that can be settled to everyone’s advantage, and fighting it as a cause. That way too, one can soon see, lie hefty chunks of declamatory drama and self-important crusading, taking in themes of universal injustice and personal integrity, the afflictions of the bloody but unbowed liberal spirit, as pompously as Lumet has ever done, from _The Pawnbroker_ to _Network_. Even when characters aren’t on the stand, the declamatory note is sustained (‘I can’t invest in failure any more, Frank’, declares the heroine, when Galvin is about to give up before the trial has begun), which at times leaves the uncanny impression that playwright Mamet, writer of Rafelson’s coolly elliptical _Postman Always Rings Twice_, has been possessed by the spirit of Clifford Odets or Paddy Chayefsky.

More than just pretentiousness, or a certain kind of old-fashioned tub-thumping, is involved here. The film proves its case, that justice can still triumph if people will only overcome their cynicism or apathy, with the kind of dramatic rhetoric – a _deus ex machina_ secret witness who can win or lose the case for Galvin; the jury’s verdict, which ignores the judge’s ruling about inadmissible evidence and makes them just a wish-fulfilment extension of the audience (or vice versa] – that doesn’t add up to any kind of argument from social cases and existing institutions. Those institutions, according to Galvin’s summation speech, are what make people cynical about real justice – to which the film proposes, like _Network_, that little people everywhere simply stand up and demand that right be done. (‘Little people’ have already crept perniciously back in an earlier declaration by redemption-bound Galvin: ‘the weak ... have got to have somebody to fight for them’.)

But what, in turn, redeems this _Network_ streak are qualities which Lumet, as a primetime buttonholer and energiser of actors at the expense of his visuals, is not supposed to have. From that opening shot, the religious dimension is incorporated less as a matter of symbolism than of visual design, with figures in a dark foreground played against backgrounds of unambiguous brightness (Andrzej Bartkowiak’s photography can suggest a scene streaming with the light of divine revelation, or again the special illumination of stained glass). Galvin’s opposite number, Ed Concannon – the self-assured organisation man versus the lonely doubter – is introduced jokily as ‘the prince of darkness’, but the appellation sticks (in seraphically smiling, bow-tied James Mason, Satan with a touch of perfidious Albion), and underlines the split in Bartkowiak’s lighting with a hint of Manicheism – or something else from Odets, perhaps, about integrity vs. success. Visually, in fact, _The Verdict_ is not-quite-expressionist, or expressionist without filmic portfolio (since Lumet’s urgent, TV-realist approach seems to bypass the cinema altogether, and has usually been decried as no style at all). But one or two characteristically portentous, low-angle shots of Galvin tearing up – or quietly suffering in – his office are as architecturally self-conscious as _Citizen Kane_, emphasising his strangely monk-like, low-ceilinged, vaulted chamber.

Style, in fact, intersects with the most ordinary on-location realism in the elliptical but sharply crystallised way Lumet builds up his picture of Boston (recalling a similar effect in _Prince of the City_, where scene-setting economy became thematic abstraction). Lumet’s realism comes with its own stylisation built in, to the extent that it is so closely identified with shooting in New York, repository of the ‘real’, as opposed to the artificiality of Hollywood (another streak of Manicheism). As far as possible in _The Verdict_, apparently, Lumet dovetailed his actual locations in Boston with stand-in ‘locations’ in his native city. Allied to this is a fragmentary realism of character, less striking here than in _Prince of the City_ because of the didactic demands of the main roles, but exemplified in one subsidiary character, the doctor who is hurriedly called in for expert testimony when Galvin’s star witness disappears. Galvin’s shock at finding that his substitute is both black and elderly is covered in a flustered attempt to put a good liberal face on it, which is then filtered through the discoveries that this man’s ‘expert’ opinion can easily be impugned, that he has his own dignity and authority and desire to see right done, and that in the end he will prove technically inadequate on the stand. These shifts of perception, at least, count for more than an attempt to reproduce the ambiguous ending of _Prince of the City_, with a question mark left hanging over the relationship of Galvin and Laura – a romance that has always been the film’s most redundant element.
