**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Truman Burbank lives an unassuming small-town life, unaware that every movement in his life is anything but ordinary. His wife, his friends, the people on the streets he walks on everyday know something that is secret to Truman, and his quest to understand what is happening to him may affect the lives of people around the world. Burkhard Dallwitz composed the bulk of the score to Peter Weir’s brilliant film, but Glass contributed two key new pieces, alongside the use of tracks from _Mishima_. The composer even makes a brief cameo in one scene, playing a piano.

Film critics and preview audiences occasionally experience something extraordinary: they get to see a ﬁlm absolutely cold, before it is written about, discussed, excerpted and trailered into ubiquity, before their friends feel unable to keep themselves from re-narrating the best bits. I feel extremely lucky to have walked into a preview of _The Truman Show_ several months ago completely ignorant of its story. By now, most inquisitive ﬁlmgoers will already know the central conceit: Truman Burbank, to all appearances a 30-year-old insurance salesman in a superﬁcially happy marriage, is unaware that he’s also the star of a TV show. Consequently, they will be robbed of the aesthetic bliss of seeing, like Truman himself, the trick revealed piece by piece.

Despite the reservations voiced elsewhere about the ﬁlm’s philosophical depth, there’s no denying that director Peter Weir shows his hand and conceals it with charming dexterity. The ﬁlm gives it all away at the start with an opening ‘credits sequence’ for the series-within-the-ﬁlm, but it’s easy not to understand what’s going on. Truman’s wife Meryl (Laura Linney with sinister, apple-cheeked irony) calls Truman’s existence and her own ‘a truly blessed life’. The series’ creator Christof (dressed all in black like a cross between a coke dealer and a kabuki stagehand) explains that, ‘Nothing you see here is faked. It’s merely controlled.’ (This omniscience recalls the hippie-transcendent notion that ‘everything happens at exactly the right time’ in Weir’s ﬁrst feature _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, which now seems like an eerie pre-echo of _The Truman Show_.) Gradually, we realise the extent of this control and that the darkened, weirdly angled shots are not affected cinematic mannerisms from Weir and Co, but subjective views of cameras within the diegesis. By the time Meryl is extolling, with an unnatural degree of enthusiasm, the virtues of a slicing-peeling-paring kitchen gadget (which will become a comical weapon later on) many viewers tuned into the insincere, television tone-of-voice that cues product placement will already have ‘got it’.

Yet even if you know _The Truman Show_’s big joke, there are many lesser ones to savour. As with the kitchen gadget, the ﬁlm delights in showing the hidden, evil nature of innocuous props and set dressing: the outsize moon (scale is wonderfully skewed here – look out for the gag about Mount Rushmore) is Christof’s observation deck; the too-friendly, ﬂoppy-eared dog next door turns into a snarling attacker when the town goes looking for the missing Truman. Echoing the dome that encases this world, much play is made out of circles and cycles and repetitions: a golf ball is used to explain that Fiji, where Truman’s true love is meant to have ﬂown, is so much on the other side of the world that ‘you can’t get any further away before you start coming back.’ Similarly, it’s in a revolving door that Truman’s rebellion begins.

Of course, a major paradoxical gag is the casting of Carrey in the lead, his character endowed with a ﬁrst name that’s just a bit too much of an allegorical nudge. He is an actor who has built a career on a kind of manic insincerity, which made him perfectly suited if irritating as a lawyer who’s jinxed into telling the truth for a day in _Liar Liar_. Here, he’s supposed to be the only ‘sincere’ person in his world, the only one who’s not lying (although he later learns deception). And yet, with his gestures large as if he’s trying to touch the outsized moon, his smile a row of blank Scrabble tiles, there’s a sense even in the earliest scenes that he’s performing for the cameras – which would be logical for someone around whom life had been choreographed since he was an infant.

What makes Carrey’s self-regarding, class-clown persona so useful to the ﬁlm is that it buttresses perhaps its most central theme: solipsism. Many have read _The Truman Show_ as an allegory of how television obsessively watches us, of Bentham-Foucault’s panopticon gone digitally out of control. What’s more poignant and haunting is that it’s really about how we all secretly want to be on television and see ourselves as the stars of our own home-life movies; it is impossible to leave the cinema after seeing _The Truman Show_ and not, at some point, wonder if the world is watching, not experience a ﬂicker of identiﬁcation with Truman (who has already been rehearsing different roles in front of his mirror every morning, before he becomes aware of the plot around him).

This is nothing new. Solipsism is one of the deﬁning tropes of literary modernism, threading through Joyce’s _Ulysses_ and most of Nabokov’s work, Borges’ ﬁction and almost every book by Philip K. Dick. But cinema and television have appropriated the theme with problematic results. In a book, the reader is always aware that a single authorial presence is playing puppetmaster; writing itself is a solipsistic process. Film’s collaborative nature tugs it into the social realm. What is more, it seldom comfortably accommodates purely subjective viewpoints. We gradually come to realise that these weird shots of Truman in the beginning are the cameras’ views of him, but who is ﬁlming Christof in his observatory? What being watches Sylvia watching Truman inside her ﬂat?

Still, _The Truman Show_ is a moving exploration of creation-anxiety, of the fear and hope that in a post-Darwinian world the only beings with real power are distant public ﬁgures and malevolent unknown forces ringfencing our capacity for free will. Solipsism haunts us because it’s both a comfort and a terror to think that someone, something has laid all this on for us, but in ﬁction like _The Truman Show_ characters get to make the last moves. I won’t give it away here, but the conclusion of the ﬁlm is both satisfying and chillingly ambiguous: Truman and the viewers get to decide – to paraphrase the series’ tagline blazoned on buttons and T-shirts worn by the show’s viewers – how it’s going to end.
