When an old skeleton with a sheriff’s badge is unearthed in a Texas border town, Sheriff Sam Deeds must investigate what could have happened to his predecessor. Examining racial violence, local legends, and myths around his own family, he ends up disturbing many long-buried secrets in the process. Academy Award®-nominated for Best Screenplay, _Lone Star_ is a thrilling neo-Western mystery, with scene-stealing turns from a young Matthew McConaughey and Frances McDormand. This stunning 4K restoration was supervised by director John Sayles and director of photography Stuart Dryburgh, and created from the 35mm original camera negative.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

The final words of _Lone Star_ are ‘Forget the Alamo’. In a border region which, as the protagonist Sam Deeds remarks with laconic understatement, ‘has seen a good number of disagreements over the years’, the past weighs heavy, constraining and distorting relationships not only between individuals but between generations and whole communities. Pilar Cruz’s words, ‘All that stuff, that history – the hell with it, right?’, are a bid to break free from the trap of past guilts and enmities and start from scratch. The film, the director John Sayles has said, is ‘about history and what we do with it. Do we use it to hit each other? Is it something that drags us down? ... At what point do you say about your parents, “That was them, this is me”?’

At the same time, that ‘Forget the Alamo’ – which Sayles at one point considered as a title for the film – shouldn’t be taken too literally. Neither Pilar (a history teacher, after all) nor Sayles is suggesting anything so crude as simply junking the past, even if any of us could. Sayles’s latest film develops the theme that has underpinned all his work to date: the sense of character as a product of accumulated social and cultural influences, the way people are moulded by their backgrounds and their pasts but can surmount that conditioning if they try hard enough. ‘Blood only means what you let it,’ Otis Payne tells his grandson, even while teaching him to be proud of his mixed Afro-Seminole ancestry. ‘Most people,’ says Cody, the redneck barman, ‘don’t want their salt and sugar in the same jar,’ but under his morose gaze two army sergeants, one Black and one white, are showing up the inadequacy of his metaphor as they plan their future life together.

After two relatively intimate chamber works – _Passion Fish_ and _The Secret of Roan Inish_ – _Lone Star_ sees Sayles returning to the broad-canvas, multiple-character mode of _Matewan_ and _City of Hope_. The new film, indeed, comes on very much as a companion piece to _City of Hope_ – one northern and urban, the other southern and smalltown-rural, but both intent on tracing lines of tension and interconnection among a wide spread of individuals, showing how they impinge on each other no matter how much they try to hold themselves separate. Several characters in _Lone Star_ strive to keep aloof: Mercedes Cruz, proud of her American citizenship, rejecting her own Hispanic background; Delmore Payne taking refuge in the rigid disciplines of army life; the Anglo parents at the school, resentful at finding themselves a minority in ‘their’ community. For _Lone Star_ is both a film about connections and also, in Sayles’s words, ‘a film about borders’ – which, however artificial, are there and have to be acknowledged, but can still be crossed. In the final scene Sam and Pilar deliberately decide to cross one of the most fundamental borders of all, the incest taboo, since it matters less than their own happiness.

In its visual style, too, the film elides borders. Flashbacks are presented, not by cuts or dissolves, but by the camera simply panning left or right, up or down into a different time-zone that nonetheless occupies part of the same space. The past, Sayles is indicating, isn’t another country; it’s still here and people like Sam are living in it, carrying it with them. And as the flashbacks accumulate, the line between moral absolutes also starts to blur. To begin with Charlie Wade and Buddy Deeds are seen as polar opposites: bad guy and good guy, ‘your ol’ time bribe and bullets sheriff’ (in Mayor Hollis Pogue’s phrase) versus the paragon of civic integrity. (The name carries its resonance; the principled hero of Frank Capra’s _Mr Deeds Goes to Town_ was played by that iconic figure of the Old West, Gary Cooper.) But as Sam digs away around the feet of the idol, determined to expose the clay, a less clearcut, more human figure emerges: a man less bad than Sam wants him to be, but less perfect than the legend paints him. ‘It’s not like there’s a borderline between the good people and the bad people,’ Otis observes.

As that line indicates, _Lone Star_ now and then tends to the overly didactic, and some of the plotting (such as the revelation that Mercedes Cruz was an illegal) comes a little too pat to carry conviction. In aspiring to a near-novelistic complexity of texture, Sayles overeggs his pudding: there are half-a-dozen more minor plot strands than the above synopsis indicates, and some of them could be axed without doing the film much damage. But _Lone Star_, while breaking new ground in Sayles’ ongoing exploration of the American myth, retains all his qualities of intelligence, political acuteness and narrative lucidity, and its widescreen photography (by Stuart Dryburgh, who photographed _The Piano_) develops the strain of visual lyricism that’s enriched his films since _Matewan_. As ever, he draws nuanced performances from his cast, blending rep company regulars like Chris Cooper (_Matewan_, _City of Hope_) with newcomers like Frances McDormand (a cameo of knife-edge hysteria as Sam’s estranged wife), and gives Kris Kristofferson his first worthwhile role for a decade.

John Sayles has always taken a fruitfully oblique angle on genre, and _Lone Star_ turns the conventions and vocabulary of the Western to its own ends. The central strand of a man gradually stripping the legend away from an admired father-figure carries echoes of Bertolucci’s _The Spider’s Stratagem_ (to say nothing of _Citizen Kane_). But, although Sayles has often said he wants his films to make people think about their own lives, not about other films, _Lone Star_’s final revelation comes so close to the denouement of _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ that it can only be intentional. The whole film, in fact, could be read as a covert critique of John Ford’s film, and even provides its own ironic version of Valance’s most famous line when Hollis protests that suppressing the truth will leave people thinking Buddy killed Wade: ‘Buddy’s a goddamn legend – he can handle it.’ It says a lot for Sayles’s achievement that his film isn’t in the least diminished by the comparison.
