Morris’s Oscar-winning portrait of Robert S. McNamara, the former US Defence Secretary, who offers his thoughts on modern warfare, is both compelling and provocative. The director made great use of his ‘interrotron’ – a device that allows the subject to see their interviewer on a screen in front of the camera, giving the impression that they are engaging with the audience directly. The film’s score underpins the gravity of the issues under discussion, but also adds a lyricism that elevates the artistry of the whole project.

**A contemporary review**  
Aged 85, Robert S. McNamara describes his life’s work to off-camera interviewer Errol Morris, structured in the form of sequential ‘lessons’. After an outstanding education, McNamara joined the US Air Corps and, alongside General Curtis LeMay, oversaw the fire-bombing of Japanese cities in 1945, causing him to reflect upon ‘how much evil must we do in order to do good’. After the war he became CEO of the Ford Motor Company, before being head-hunted by President Kennedy as Secretary of Defence. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 taught him that ‘the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will destroy nations’.

After Kennedy’s assassination, he served Lyndon Johnson as the US first engaged in and then escalated the war in Vietnam. As the war became a political quagmire and public support waned, McNamara concluded it was a lost cause, and left the Cabinet in February 1968. He was subsequently instructed by meetings with Castro (who did have missiles in 1962) and a North Vietnamese general (who denied any attack on the US fleet in the Tonkin Gulf). Pressed by Morris to assess his own personal responsibility for failed policies, he concludes ‘I am not going to say any more than I have’.

Playwright David Rabe once protested the labelling of his magnificent Vietnam Plays as ‘anti-war’, arguing that plays about unruly youth, for instance, were not considered ‘anti-youth’; and that war, like youth, was ‘permanently a part of the eternal human pageant’. A medical corpsman in Vietnam, Rabe knew of what he spoke, albeit not so comprehensively as Robert McNamara, subject of Errol Morris’ latest investigation. ‘I’m not so naive or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war,’ McNamara tells Morris. ‘We’re not going to change human nature anytime soon.’

Robert S. McNamara has aged quite well, and lived long enough to revisit the byways of his awful career for a new generation perhaps less familiar with the name and face of the notorious cerebrate who prosecuted the Vietnam War under Kennedy and Johnson. Morris gives McNamara a spare, respectful platform here, their lengthy interviews augmented by vivid and unfamiliar archive footage, the airing of declassified White House tapes, and one of those thrumming Philip Glass scores suggestive of contemporary opera.

Morris tries to generate a probing intimacy with his subject, and McNamara is clearly on a mission to explain, if not to fully disclose. He implies that he came to see the Vietnam War as a hopeless endeavour before his Pentagon peers, but still insists upon the gravity of the Cold War stakes of the age (which Morris illustrates, perhaps inevitably, with tumbling lines of dominoes). McNamara’s toughest call on himself concerns the US fire-bombing of Japanese cities and civilians in 1945, decisive actions which, he offers, would be construed as war crimes had the war against fascism foundered. But then, every school-leaver knows that victors write history; and McNamara can offset his seeming remorse with the untrammelled bloodthirst of his accomplice General Curtis LeMay, who went on to lobby for pre-emptive nuclear war against Cuba.

Morris’ film is perhaps sharpest in showing how a wonk such as McNamara could be propelled to the zenith of the Pentagon, and how his intellect crashed, as any body’s would, in the face of a mission so wrong-headed as Vietnam. The McNamara of the 21st century shows an interest in counterfactual history that befits both a scholar and a man with compendious causes for regret. Naturally, he suggests that had Kennedy lived, the US would have smartly extricated itself from South East Asia, a delusion that was equally risible when essayed by Oliver Stone in _JFK_.

The force of recall does not leave McNamara unmoved: his eyes moisten before the camera on several occasions. Inevitably there are tears for Jack and Bobby Kennedy, and for the strains upon his wife Marge and three children. (One can imagine how the kids felt when a war protestor immolated himself below McNamara’s office window in 1965.) But then McNamara weeps even in reciting a stave from the hardy conservative mysticism of T.S. Eliot. He is not, one senses, a broken man, but rather someone who believes that tough choices are the unhappy lot of truly substantive individuals.

_The Fog of War_ is handsomely assembled, and will enjoy currency for as long as the United States is embedded in Iraq, since McNamara ventures a critique of US unilateralism which is congruent to the critics of Bush’s war (‘If we can’t persuade nations of comparable values of the merit of our cause, then we’d better re-examine our reasons’). But its lasting impression is of a man who won’t be lured out from his wilderness of mirrors. It’s a diverting lecture on a big theme, but a frustrating experience too.
