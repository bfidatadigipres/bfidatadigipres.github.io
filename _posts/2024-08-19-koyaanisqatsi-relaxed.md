A timely alert to how life on Earth is changing, Godfrey Reggio’s film was produced on a surprisingly small budget over many years, only to become an instant cult success. Philip Glass’s gorgeous music swells in intensity as the growing impact of technology on humanity becomes more apparent within the film’s procession of images. Join us after the screening to reflect on the film through a neurodivergent lens.

The post screening discussion will be led by creative Sam Chown Ahern, of the Neurocultures collective.
