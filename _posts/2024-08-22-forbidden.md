_+ intro by film critic Phuong Le_

Producer/director George King is a figure who has been unjustly neglected by British cinema historians. Often described as ‘King of the Quota Quickies’, he is generally written off as a hack who churned out cheap films of little merit. It is perhaps true that King was an astute businessman more than an ‘artist’ but out of the large filmography he built up during the 1930s and 1940s there are several titles worth a second look.

King began working in the industry in the early 1920s after dropping out of medical school and he was employed by various film distributors to provide exhibitors with ideas for the promotion of their films. His directorial debut was the 1930 film _Too Many Crooks_ which was also the screen debut of actor Laurence Olivier. Always an artisan, King managed to shoot the film for Fox in three days. Those who worked with King concur on the fact that he was one of the most dapper directors around and would never appear on set without a suit and tie. No doubt he could afford this sartorial elegance due to his technique of making quota quickies, described thus by Derek Threadgall in _Shepperton Studios: An Independent View_: ‘Other producers made this type of film for 15s a foot and sold them for one pound a foot. King managed to make them for 14s 6d a foot, which gave him a Rolls Royce car and a riverside house in Halliford.’

By the late 1940s, George King’s filmmaking activity had slowed almost to a halt and _Forbidden_ was the last film he directed. The film’s nine-week shoot began on 19 July 1948 at Riverside Studios under the working title _A Lady Was to Die_. King surrounded himself with technicians and creative personnel with whom he had worked on previous projects; Harold Richmond had been his production manager on and off for 17 years and art director Bernard Robinson had worked on _Crimes at the Dark House_ and _The Case of the Frightened Lady_ (both 1940). Katherine Strueby wrote the King-produced films _The First of the Few_ (1942) and _Candlelight in Algeria_ (1943) (the latter of which he also directed), both made under the banner of British Aviation Pictures, the company King set up with Leslie Howard.

Hazel Court had also worked with King before, on the 1946 film _Gaiety George_, a biopic of Irish stage producer George Edwardes. Although she was only 22 when she made _Forbidden_, she already had a large filmography under her belt, having debuted on the screen at the age of 18 in the 1944 Ealing film _Champagne Charlie_. Kenneth Griffith had appeared two years earlier in King’s _The Shop at Sly Corner_ in which he played a similarly nasty character; from the very brief mention of _Forbidden_ in his autobiography, it seems he was fed up with this typecasting and was ready to move on.

Canadian-born Douglass Montgomery had begun his film career in America in the early 30s, appearing opposite Katharine Hepburn in _Little Women_ (1933) and starring in _Waterloo Bridge_ (1931) billed as Kent Douglass to avoid confusion with fellow MGM star Robert Montgomery. When war broke out, he took a break from the screen to join the Canadian army; his comeback was announced in _Picturegoer_ in 1945, when he was in Britain to make Anthony Asquith’s _The Way to the Stars_ (1945).

_Forbidden_ is set on Blackpool’s Golden Mile where Jim Harding and his assistant Dan Collins set up shop selling Jim’s own recipe hair restorer. Despite the Blackpool setting the film was made entirely in the studio with stock footage used for establishing shots and some back projection.

Post-war British cinema produced a great many crime dramas, which some have argued constitute a British film noir. _Forbidden_ falls into the sub-category described by Raymond Durgnat in _All Our Yesterdays_ as ‘Close pent-up guilt’, in which a normally mild middle-class character is driven to murder. In this type of film, Durgnat explains, the murders are usually by some slow method, in contrast to American noirs in which less subtle techniques are employed. In addition, he states, ‘most such films involve us so closely with their murderers as to induce an involuntary identification with them, often coupled with a certain sympathy for their motives and an antipathy towards their victims.’

Critics found much to praise in the film. _Monthly Film Bulletin_ considered that ‘Douglass Montgomery is at his best as the overwrought Jim and Patricia Burke is convincing as his selfish ambitious wife’ but noted that Hazel Court’s accent lapses too often to make her portrayal of a cockney entirely credible. (Perhaps the bout of tooth trouble, which kept her away from the set for several days, accounts for her lack of vocal dexterity.) _Today’s Cinema_ regarded the film as having ‘all the qualities of drama, suspense and thrill which go to the making of tingling melodrama.’
