**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

It looks like a tribute to Quentin Tarantino’s fast rise to fame that he has managed to draw quite such a varied crowd of names for _Pulp Fiction_. And yet when you examine those names, they are mostly those of actors in search of a hit. _Pulp Fiction_ is full of five-minute culture jokes; could this be another one? Possibly; for several of the cast appear to be playing warped versions of characters for which they are known. Bruce Willis’ tough guy Butch may be a _Die Hard_sman, but this time round, Butch is a little bit stupid and has a nasty temper. Rosanna Arquette’s crazy lady from _After Hours_ has turned into a junkie’s housewife, utterly absorbed in the piercings on her body. Harvey Keitel reprises his role in the _Nikita_ remake _The Assassin_, as the icy, mute killer, who cleans up after dead bodies and gets rid of the living ones. Only this time, the grim-faced Wolf has absurd touches of Regular Guy about him. He chats about coffee, and his clean-up operation does not involve acid baths but soapy sponges and hose-downs. Some of the actors are not even playing out their own former roles in this rag-bag of film references; to take just Tarantino’s own work, Honey Bunny and Pumpkin, who open and close the film, are straight out of _True Romance_, while the hitmen Jules and Vincent could have been in _Reservoir Dogs_.

It is a remarkable achievement that the film manages to hold all these people together through four different storylines. Perhaps because we get to know him best, the link seems to be John Travolta’s Vincent. Flashy Vincent is what the disco-loving street boy Tony Manero would have grown up to be after _Saturday Night Fever_. And he still needs to sort himself out. Vincent has enough sense not to let himself sleep with Marsellus’s wife, Mia, when he gets the opportunity, but is stupid enough to leave his gun lying around while he goes to the bathroom. We see him shoot heroin, and we see him on the lavatory, and Vincent therefore becomes vulnerable. But like everyone else here, he has little regard for human life, and when he accidentally shoots his hostage’s head off, he worries more about his suit than about what he has done.

Violence is still Tarantino’s watchword, and _Pulp Fiction_ abounds with other nasty, casual deaths. No one is immune; even Vincent, the hero of sorts, dies with an undignified snap of the fingers. Life in the 90s, Tarantino seems to be saying, is speedy and worthless. The people on the screen are, as the film’s title makes plain, characters from trash novels. They are drug dealers, killers, crime lords, spoilt ladies, prize boxers, S&M rapists. Everyone is on the run, off their heads, or on the wrong side of the law. And yet in a way they could be us, too. If Tarantino has anything to say, it seems to be that there is no morality or justice in the patterns of life and death. Instead, the nihilist argument continues, there is trivia.

For if we are not supposed to empathise with the characters themselves, we cannot help recognising the junk culture world they inhabit; a world filled with ridiculous TV programmes, gimmicky restaurants where the waiters dress up as film stars and steaks are named after directors, and powerful drugs that demand their own place in a daily timetable. Trash is not just the written word, it is all around. And here it is endlessly recycled in the endless conversations of Tarantino’s pulp protagonists.

In the car, Vincent and Jules are engrossed in the French names for hamburgers. As the camera follows them towards the apartment of boys they are about kill, they talk about foot massages. When Butch gets to the motel in which he is meeting Fabienne before they flee with his winnings, she starts chatting about the fatness of her stomach. This is the kind of stuff most of us actually do spend much of our time talking about, and it puts us on a level of understanding with the characters. The effect is strangely subtle in a film that is all about crude gestures. Mia, herself a bizarre mixture of spoilt child and wise woman, remarks that Marsellus’s henchmen are worse than a sewing circle when it comes to gossip. And suddenly the killers have been emasculated.

_True Romance_ seemed to become less Quentin Tarantino and more its director Tony Scott every time it lapsed into sentimentality, so it is hardly surprising that Tarantino imposes a sizeable emotional distance between the audience and the characters. When Butch dreams about Captain Koons (a hilarious cameo by Christopher Walken) giving him his father’s watch, a sentimental episode from a thousand TV movies becomes more ludicrous and disgusting by the minute. And even though each section of the film ends with a moment of collaboration – between Vincent and Mia, Marsellus and Butch, and finally Jules, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny – the sense of shame that could bring about an attempt at a heartfelt moment is subsumed by the characters’ self-interest. In the same way, it would be an effort to feel sentimental over the film’s one big emotional transformation. Samuel L. Jackson’s Jules is an extraordinary character, with touches of Robert Mitchum’s preaching murderer in _The Night of the Hunter_. He goes about his killing business with religious fervour, spouting Ezekiel at his terrified victims as if to justify his acts. And what changes his mind about his work? Not a crisis of conscience but a realisation of his own mortality. More self-preservation; the philosophical new Jules is as hard and cold as the old one. He resists the temptation to kill Pumpkin not because he has found mercy but because he has made a decision to stop killing.

Butch is the nearest we might get to a sentimentalist – he has a girl he loves and enough heart to go back and rescue his arch-enemy from the rapists. But Butch is not nice either. In Tarantino’s movie reference library, Butch is more loudmouth Ralph Meeker in _Kiss Me Deadly_ than sappy Fred MacMurray in _Double Indemnity_.

Like _Reservoir Dogs_, this is stylishly shot in neo-cartoon style, with massive, distorting close-ups offset by attractively angled shots. The effect again, is of a hard, closed, rather linear world. But in some ways, there is more to _Pulp Fiction_ than to the first film. For one thing, there are a few women in it, and a broader spectrum of characters. For another, by allowing just a few chinks in its dispassionate armour, mostly through Travolta’s oddly affable Vincent Vega, it is easier to like rather than just admire.
