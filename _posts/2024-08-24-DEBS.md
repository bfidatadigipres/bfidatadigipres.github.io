_+ panel discussion and Zoom Q&A with director Angela Robinson_

Amy is a top student at the D.E.B.S. academy for elite spies in training, but when tasked with taking down notorious supervillain Lucy Diamond, love soon gets in the way of espionage. An absolute masterclass in camp, Angela Robinson’s cult sapphic spy comedy celebrates its 20th birthday this year.  
Join us for a fun-filled anniversary screening, bookended by a thematic discussion and a Q&A.

**Event schedule:**

20:00 – Event start and intro  
20:10 – Thematic discussion about the queer villain  
20:35 – Screening of _D.E.B.S._ begins  
22:06 – Screening of _D.E.B.S._ ends; Q&A begins  
22:35 – Event ends

The event’s first panel will explore the nuances of queer and queer coded villains in film, dissecting the queer community’s fascination with morally skewed characters as camp, and looking at how villainy can often be claimed as ‘iconic’ in LGBTQIA+ spaces. Hosted by event co-programmer Lilia Pavin-Franks (she/her) and featuring writer-curator Siavash Minoukadeh (he/they) and writer-curator Cici Peng (she/her).

After the screening, _D.E.B.S._ director Angela Robinson will be in conversation via Zoom with event co-programmer Grace Barber-Plentie (she/her).  

**D.E.B.S.**  
Never underestimate a girl with a gun and perfect hair…

Every year, high school students across the country sharpen their pencils and prepare for college. Unbeknownst to these students however, the US government has hidden a diagnostic test within the examination to measure one’s aptitude for lying, cheating and killing. If a young woman scores high enough on this covert portion of the test, she is recruited to join an underground academy, known only as D.E.B.S. that grooms young girls to become secret agents. After graduation, these girls will go to work protecting their country against the world’s most dangerous criminals – and they’ll keep their lipstick perfectly applied while they do it.

Discipline. Energy. Beauty. Strength. A killer fashion sense. Do you have what it takes to join the D.E.B.S.?

In this girl-power adventure comedy, the four young women of the Academy’s ‘A’ squad have learned stealth surveillance, firearms training and martial arts – they are almost finished with their D.E.B.S. spy training. Amy is a straight-A student and the only girl ever to earn a perfect score on the secret test. Max is a fierce leader – the take-no-prisoners, leave-no-stone-unturned captain of the squad.

The only girl in her squad not to have earned the requisite pre-graduation stripes, Janet is timid, proper and never-been-kissed. Lastly, Domique – with her devil-may-care attitude, nicotine addiction and inability to keep boys out of her bedroom after curfew – makes up the final member of this super sleuth squad. Under the tutelage of tough-as-nails headmistress Mrs. Peatree and Academy President Phipps, these uniquely individual girls have been carefully selected and trained to be strong, lethal and incredibly adept with an eyebrow pencil. Now they must combine all their skills to save the world from vexing vixen Lucy Diamond, the most deadly criminal the world has ever known – and the sexiest woman to ever take hostages and wield an Uzi.

Though _D.E.B.S._ is an action-packed adventure comedy, the making of the film was more like a Cinderella story. It all began when writer/director Angela Robinson sketched a few comic book drawings of an idea she had for an all-girl crew of high school secret agents. _D.E.B.S_. With colourful characters, a sexy uber-villain, and a Technicolor premise, Robinson felt her story seemed perfectly suited to a comic book or cartoon. Although she flirted with turning the project into a web animation, it never materialised. Fresh from film school, Robinson received a grant from an organisation called ‘Power Up’ to produce a ten-minute short, and she decided to move her drawings from paper to the big screen; bringing to life the film version of _D.E.B.S._

Shot on a small budget – but with high hopes – Robinson and her producers, Andrea Sperling and Jasmine Kosovic, shot the _D.E.B.S._ short film in the summer of 2002. Once completed, they submitted and were accepted into the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. To their excitement, it was met with a great deal of praise and a lot of laughter. Everyone enjoyed the high-concept idea of girls equally at home with martial arts and make-up, and the short created a great deal of buzz.

The true Cinderella moment came when _D.E.B.S._ caught the attention of Screen Gems president Clint Culpepper, who wanted to create a full-length version of the short film. ‘Fortunately,’ says Robinson, ‘I had already completed a script that elaborated on the premise of the short.’ Adds producer Kosovic, ‘After Angela wrote and directed the short, she was so inspired and so psyched she wrote the feature script in no time; it just flowed.’ They began shooting the feature only a few short months later.

It was exhilarating for the filmmakers to fully realise their _D.E.B.S._ dream. Of the finished feature, Kosovic says, ‘It’s just bigger and funnier. You really get more into each character. The script is richer; everything’s just amped up. It’s like the difference between a short story and a novel.’

Writer/director Angela Robinson received her BA from Brown University and then studied film at the New York University Graduate Film Program. While at NYU, she made several short films and assisted director Spike Lee. Robinson most recently was a staff writer for the Showtime series, _The L Word_. Her short film _D.E.B.S._ was accepted into the Sundance Film Festival last year, for which she is now making her first feature film.
