**Who in da Mornin**  
A lovingly created portrait of the annual Bahamian Junkanoo festival – a masque and music tribute to the warrior king of the West African Ahanta, who resisted colonialism. The film is also a celebration of the enduring spirit of new world African people.

**Sugar Cane Malice**  
Zapata, who is also an artist and architect, delivers a rigorous portrait of the plight of Haitian migrant workers in the Dominican Republic, who work on one of the largest US-owned plantations in the world.

**Jonathan Isaac Jackson** is a New Orleanian filmmaker and Managing Partner at The Colored Section. His first feature documentary, _Big Chief, Black Hawk_, was nominated for Best Documentary by American Black Film Festival (2021) and the Black Reel Awards (2022), and was named the top Hollywood South film of 2021 by nola.com before being acquired by American Documentary and WORLD Channel in 2022. His second feature documentary _Who In Da Mornin_ was produced and shot in The Bahamas and has screened in the US, throughout the Caribbean, and in Europe.

Jonathan holds an MFA in Film from Vermont College of Fine Arts and continues to work on creating a cinematic language that can continue to bring the African Diaspora together by highlighting the celebrations of black communities as a connection to their ancestors.

**Mario Gousse** is an Ayitian-born Science Educator in the UK.

He is a member of the Pan-Afrikan Society Community Forum and the Haiti Support Group, also in the UK.

He is the founder of the Jan Jak Desalin Imperial Institute, in Ayiti.
