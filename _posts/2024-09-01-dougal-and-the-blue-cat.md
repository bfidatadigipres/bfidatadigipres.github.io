The arrival of Buxton the Blue Cat throws Dougal, Florence and friends into turmoil. His desire for control and obsession with Blue sees Buxton become increasingly powerful, proclaiming that everything will become his favourite colour and anything not blue is to be destroyed. Will Dougal save his friends, the garden and the day? Eric Thompson’s witty script and incomparable voice talent added a new dimension to Serge Danot’s world.  


**From one living-room to millions**  
Serge Danot, director of the animation for _Dougal and the Blue Cat_, started making puppets at the age of ten. He based his first models on the pets that his family kept, and on the farm animals he saw around him in the French village of Clisson, near Nantes.

Later in life he learned the art of bringing puppets to life on film by the technique of frame-by-frame animation. At that time he had a large shaggy dog as a pet. He made a puppet based on this dog, revived some old ones from his childhood, added some new ones, and then wrote and designed for them a story which he called _Le Manège enchanté_ (_The Magic Roundabout_).

For several years no company was interested in Danot’s project, so he was unable to get the money to buy a studio and start a full-scale production. In 1965, with his last few hundred frames, he animated and filmed a few _Magic Roundabout_ episodes, more or less single-handedly, using his own living-room as a studio.

This time both the BBC and French television thought that Danot’s idea was worth buying and they bought it. Other countries soon followed suit. Three years later, it was estimated that _The_ _Magic Roundabout_ had a worldwide audience of 250 million. Danot was able to turn an old paper factory into a film studio, employ 50 animators, and turn out hundreds of 4.5 minute episodes. Shops all over the world did good business for many years, selling _Magic Roundabout_ soap, toys, puppets, books, sweets, slippers, breakfast cereals, etc, etc.

**Pollux Becomes Dougal**  
The version of _The Magic Roundabout_ shown on BBC TV is very different from that shown in France. This is partly because Eric Thompson, the actor who the BBC employed to do the English version, could not speak French. He used to just watch the episodes in a viewing theatre, without any sound at all, and then make up a story and dialogue to fit the puppets and their movements. He never knew, or cared, what Serge Danot had intended them to be saying and doing.

For a start, Thompson changed the characters’ names. The shaggy dog who Danot had called Pollux became Dougal on British screens. Other name changes were Florence (Margot in French), Brian (Ambroise), Dylan (Flapy), Zebedee (Zebulon) and Ermintrude (Azalée).

Also, Dougal’s character had to be changed considerably from that of Pollux, because in French the main joke about Pollux is that he is an English dog who speaks French badly, with a very ‘funny’ accent. Thompson decided that there was no way he could adapt that joke into English, certainly not to last through hundreds of episodes. Instead he made Dougal a gruff individualist, trying to go his own way. Probably the only characteristic he shares with Pollux is his fondness for sugar lumps.

**A contemporary review**  
_Dougal and the Blue Cat_ is derived from _The Magic Roundabout_, the television puppet animation series. Devotees of the programme who feared that its intimate style would be lost in the transition from five-minute spot to full-length feature can relax. Dougal and his friends survive unscathed and the result is enchanting. Eric Thompson, who wrote the English version of both series and film (the original idea and splendid animation are French), has created a marvellously endearing character in the self-important Dougal, a resourceful dog whose stock of asides would not have disgraced Tony Hancock. ‘Fickle jade!’ he mutters as Florence lavishes attention on the Blue Cat, and ‘There’ll be tears before bedtime’ as disaster looms.

The minor characters are no less endearing: Florence, who sings little songs to reflect her mood; Brian, a trusting and cheerful snail; Dylan, a hip but sleepy rabbit; and Ermintrude, a lovely theatrical cow who paints (‘I’m going through my blue period, dahlings’). It is this constant disparity between the simplicity of the puppet characters and the sophistication of what they say that proves so attractive. ‘I was the victim of a false doctrine’ declares the defeated Buxton. Eric Thompson both narrates and plays all the parts, apart from the Blue Voice (unmistakably Fenella Fielding’s) and it is a tribute to his acting ability that his voice never becomes boring or obtrusive. One reservation: 80 minutes is a long time for very young children to sit still, particularly if they’re not quite old enough to appreciate all the humour. But the many adult fans of _The Magic Roundabout_ will find the film delightful.
