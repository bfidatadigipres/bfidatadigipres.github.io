Horror films or stories of the supernatural were little attempted in British cinema prior to the days of Hammer in the 1950s. There are the exceptions of course, such as _The Ghoul_ (1933) and _Dark Eyes of London_ (1939), but the field was, by and large, left open to Hollywood, and Universal Studios in particular. The fact that ‘H’ (for horror) films were banned by the British censor during the war years did not help matters. In 1944, Ealing encountered some success with the film _The_ _Halfway House_, not a horror film per se, but a story with supernatural elements in which a group of disparate people gathered at a remote inn gradually realise that the innkeeper and his daughter are ghosts. The success of this film served as an encouragement to Michael Balcon to produce something along similar lines. Thus was _Dead of Night_ born.

Instead of focusing on the one story, as with _The Halfway House_, _Dead_ _of Night_ comprises five, with an overall story linking them all together. Initially however there were only the five main stories. The decision to produce a portmanteau film had been taken from the outset of production but, although the wish to link them together was always present, the means by which to do so was proving elusive. The writer Angus MacPhail provided the answer. MacPhail had already co-written the screenplay for _The Halfway House_ and the ingenious linking story he adapted for _Dead of Night_ bears some similarities to that film, dealing as it does with another group of people gathered at a remote farmhouse recounting the five tales. The fact that Basil Dearden, director of _The Halfway House_, also directed this linking story only serves to emphasise the similarities.

In addition to the linking story, Dearden also directed ‘The Hearse Driver’, the first of the stories recounted within the film. Charles Crichton directed ‘The Golfing Story’ from a H.G. Wells tale, and Cavalcanti directed ‘The Christmas Story’, another of Angus MacPhail’s contributions. But the film is remembered above all for two of the stories, ‘The Haunted Mirror’ and, most famously, ‘The Ventriloquist’s Dummy’, both from the pen of John Baines, with Cavalcanti directing the latter in which Michael Redgrave gives one of his strongest performances as the ventriloquist slowly going mad, adopting both the personality and voice of ‘Hugo’, the dummy he uses in his stage act, the fixed smile of Hugo becoming increasingly menacing as the tale unfolds.

‘The Haunted Mirror’ directed by Robert Hamer, relates the story of the said mirror’s malevolent influence on the husband of a newly married couple, eventually driving him to the point of attempted murder. Notable for excellent performances from both Ralph Michael and Googie Withers (the latter being singled out by the _Monthly Film Bulletin_ from the film’s entire cast as deserving of special mention) the episode was the first film for which Hamer received a director credit (after some uncredited co-directorial work at Ealing) and amply demonstrates the talent he was soon to bring to bear on other films for the studio, including two further films with Withers, _Pink String_ _and Sealing Wax_ (1945) and _It Always Rains on Sunday_ (1947). The story is also of note for one of the first presentations on film, along with Lewis Allen’s _The Uninvited_ (1944), of an evil, malevolent ghost, as opposed to the comic or ethereal presences that predominated in the cinema prior to this, such as the Topper series, or the Boulting’s _Thunder Rock_ (1942).

The problem with any portmanteau film, especially those with different writers and directors working on the various episodes, is that the quality of those episodes can vary alarmingly, with at least one letting the film down. Unfortunately _Dead of Night_ is no exception, with ‘The Golfing Story’ proving to be the guilty party. This comedic story with Radford and Wayne, inserted as light relief, may have looked promising on paper, but its inclusion was a dire misjudgement, only serving to slow the pace of the film as a whole and dilute the tension.

_Dead of Night_ was hailed on its release as ‘the smoothest film yet to come from an English studio’ by the _Monthly Film Bulletin_, while _The_ _Spectator_ declared that the film ‘succeeds so well because it has avoided all the mumbo-jumbo traditionally associated with such subjects’. Only Richard Winnington, writing in the _News Chronicle_, cast a dispiriting note when he called the linking story ‘confused and illogical’. _The Daily Sketch_ reviewer singled out ‘The Haunted Mirror’ and ‘The Ventriloquist’s Dummy’ as the better episodes, while most of the other reviews cited ‘The Ventriloquist’s Dummy’ as the best episode, but, mind-bogglingly, ‘The Golfing Story’ as the other highpoint. It was viewed as ‘very pleasant relief from so much eerie tension’ by the _Daily Mail_. What is generally seen as a misjudgement today was obviously not so in 1945.

Despite the box office and critical success of _Dead of Night_, the following years did not see any eagerness from Balcon to follow this up with films in a similar vein. There were to be no ‘Ealing horrors’ as there were ‘Ealing comedies’. David Pirie has argued, albeit contentiously, that the Victorian gothic setting seen within the mirror in ‘The Haunted Mirror’ episode was an influence on the gothic settings of Hammer’s films. It is arguably not until the 1960s however that the influence of _Dead of Night_ actually began to be felt in British horror cinema (by way of 1950s US comics), when Hammer’s horror rival, Amicus Productions, instituted a series of portmanteau horror films, beginning with  
_Dr Terror’s House of Horrors_ (1964), and culminating in the early 1970s with such offerings as _Asylum_ (1972), _Tales from the Crypt_ (1972) and _The Vault of Horror_ (1973).

Of the film’s episodes ‘The Ventriloquist’s Dummy’ has enjoyed the most lasting influence. The same story has been used in at least two films since 1945, _Devil Doll_ (1963) with William Sylvester, and Richard Attenborough’s _Magic_ (1978) with Anthony Hopkins. It also resurfaced yet again in an episode of the American TV series _Tales from the Crypt_ (no relation to the Amicus film) with Don Rickles this time being the unfortunate ventriloquist. And what is Chucky in the unjustly reviled _Child’s Play_ series of films if not an extension of ‘Hugo’? The episode may have even been an influence on Hitchcock. The conclusion of _Psycho_, with Norman Bates in custody and finally dominated by the mother personality, bears striking similarities to the conclusion of ‘The Ventriloquist’s Dummy’ when Michael Redgrave is in custody and has succumbed totally to the ‘Hugo’ character, voice and all.

The popularity and influence of this film lives on, and as a portmanteau film it remains unsurpassed. As Charles Barr stated in his history of Ealing, _Dead of Night_ is ‘after the comedies, the Ealing film most frequently revived and remembered, remaining one of the key films of the whole output’.
