_+ intro by musician and_ Starve Acre _composer Matthew Herbert (Wednesday 4 September only)_

**Jan Svankmajer on ‘Little Otík’**  
Little Otík _is based on a folk tale best known from the version by K.J. Erben. What attracted you to the subject?_

In the early ’70s Eva [Svankmajerová] was looking for a ‘drastic’ fairytale that she could make into an animated short film. _Otesánek_ was her final choice; she had illustrated the story earlier for a children’s book. She asked me to help her with the script, and suddenly I realised what a great subject I was handling. That it was, in effect, a topical version of the Faust myth: a rebellion against nature and the tragic dimension of that rebellion. In short, I stole the story from Eva and subsequently integrated her original idea into the final shape of my script.

_You say the name Otesánek is untranslatable, but there’s a lot of play in the dialogue about the baby’s real name (Otík) and the character in the folk tale (Otesánek). What is the significance of this?_

The word _Otesánek_ is a blend of the word to hew and the diminutive noun ending ‘ánek’, used mostly for words characterising children. Figuratively the word _Otesánek_ is used in Czech to characterise a person who devours and digests everything, not only food.

_Most of your features combine puppets with live actors, and the central characters exist as both puppets and real people. But in_ Little Otík _none of the characters change their status. Is this a new departure?_

_Little Otík_ differs from my previous films mainly by being a version of a traditionally constructed story with normal dialogue. That’s not the case with _Alice_ or _Faust_, and certainly not with _Conspirators of Pleasure_. In this sense _Little Otík_ is the most conventional of my films. In its subject matter, though, it’s quite close to _Faust_ and, in showing the omnipotence of desire, to _Conspirators of Pleasure_. This is only another angle on the subjects that obsess me, not a new departure in my work.

_In many folk tales a child is threatened by an ogre or wild beast. In_ Little Otík _, by contrast, the child has become an ogre. What was the intention behind this reversal?_

I do not work with intentions. Pursuing intentions leads to making films as theses. That has nothing to do with freedom of the imagination. It’s common knowledge that the subconscious components of our mind are just as meaningful as the conscious. So my preference is for _post facto_ interpretation rather than intention. In _Little Otík_ the child devours its ‘parents’. Otík is the product of their desire, their rebellion against nature. This is not a child in the real sense of the word, but the materialisation of desire, of rebellion. That’s the tragic dimension of the human destiny – it’s impossible to live without rebelling against the human lot.

That is the essence of freedom. The Marquis de Sade invoked nature in his early texts, but in later works he condemned it, calling it a whore and a murderess, rebelling against it. But between de Sade and the present there’s a history of shocking experiences in human civilisation. Without that terrible ambivalence we are unable to face anything, certainly not nature. That’s why we end our rebellions on our knees.

Little Otík _is much longer than your other features and its narrative progression is more orthodox. Was this a matter of being faithful to the original story?_

Storytelling, whatever the story, has its own laws. It differs from recounting a dream (as in _Alice_). Similarly, when you start using conventional dialogue, you’ve got to realise the film will be longer. A film told through dialogue (without a narrator) always works in a roundabout way, which requires time; figurative speech – the language of pictures and symbols – is more direct and consequently shorter. _Little Otík_ is long because I made a wrong estimate of the roundabout way. In other words, it involved a rather different way of working than I have used so far.

_The telling of Erben’s original tale takes the form of two-dimensional animation. What is its function within the film?_

Erben’s tale read by Alzbetka is an independent animated short that has an important role in the film, in that it gives the spectator a clear picture of the original myth, unadulterated by the deformations of present-day society. It is this that provides the source of Alzbetka’s ‘knowledge’ and her ‘counter activity’. Thus animated, the Erben tale could stand on its own (with minor alterations) as an independent short film. It’s a film within a film.

_The surrealist group you belong to has participated in various exhibitions in Prague since the fall of communism. Does this newfound recognition pose a threat?_

The fact that since November 1989 the group has arranged a number of public events, including the issuing of the review _Analogon_, and has tried to acquaint the broader public with its activities doesn’t mean it has become integrated into Czech culture. Surrealism has always been a minority affair, even in the ’30s. In so far as it was perceived at all it was considered to be an abscess on the body of Czech culture. Today the rabid attacks of the fascist establishment and Stalinist lackeys have been replaced by indifference and ignorance. For art historians surrealism has long been dead, which is why they are only interested in historical surrealism and ignore the present movement. I do not think we are in any danger of ‘recognition’.

_You once described Walt Disney as one of the leading destroyers of European culture. What is being destroyed and how can this be resisted?_

Disney is among the greatest makers of ‘art for children’. I have always held that no special art for children simply exists, and what passes for it embodies either the birch (discipline) or lucre (profit). ‘Art for children’ is dangerous in that it participates either in the taming of the child’s soul or the bringing up of consumers of mass culture. I am afraid a child reared on current Disney produce will find it difficult to get used to more sophisticated kinds of art and will assume his/her place in the ranks of viewers of idiotic television serials. That doesn’t mean that works with imaginative value may not occasionally crop up in consumer culture – for instance, _King Kong_. But I fear their number is dwindling.
