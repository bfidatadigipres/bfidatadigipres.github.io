Shot in four weeks on a minuscule budget and written by director Olivier Assayas for the Hong Kong action star Maggie Cheung, _Irma Vep_ explodes like a firework over its thematic terrain: a mourning for cinema’s ‘innocent’ past.

In a film about the making of a television film, Cheung plays herself. She is cast by a burnt-out, middle-aged French _auteur_ René Vidal (Jean-Pierre Léaud) to play Irma Vep, the famous black-clad Parisian criminal, in a remake of the 1915 French silent serial _Les Vampires_ (directed by Louis Feuillade). Vidal’s _idée fixe_ is of Musidora, the original Irma Vep, as an icon of cinema grace and of Feuillade as cinema’s brilliant primitive. But he knows that his attempt to revive their purity is little more than a futile séance. Assayas seems to share Vidal’s obsessions, yet he seeds this film with telling glimpses of images that suggest that such ‘innocence’ is still possible. A video screening of the 1968 militant film _Classe de lutte_ stands for political purity and Vidal’s own terminal film-poem is its poetic equivalent.

Although petty rivalries and myopic arrogance characterise the depictions of film people here, Cheung herself is grace incarnate, deliberately demystifying her star persona. When Vidal describes her, in her Hong Kong action persona, as being ‘like an acrobat,’ she tells him, ‘It’s all done by stunt men.’ Yet she displays a touching faith in Vidal, whose intuition about her (which is also Assayas’) proves correct: in her black latex catsuit, she does make an iconic and slinky Irma. Assayas succeeds where the fictional Vidal fails because he can use Vidal as a surrogate conscience to shoulder the weight of film history for him. Where Vidal is creatively exhausted by his fidelity to the past, Assayas can be an urgent force. _Irma Vep_ doesn’t work out its mourning for cinema with the romantic nostalgia of Godard’s _Le Mépris_ or _Passion_, it’s more like the Mexican Day of the Dead: remembrance as an act of celebration.

The theme of cinema history as a dead weight on modern directors is crystallised by the film’s ending, when the replacement director, José Murano, watches Vidal’s edited footage: a viciously experimental squall of film. Shots of Maggie-as-Irma are bleached-out, out-of-focus, scratched and defaced; the obsessive attention paid to every frame reflects Vidal’s state of mind. He’s like a child who colours in every letter of a favourite book before trashing it. He can’t possess Maggie – Irma is inviolably distant anyway – so he vengefully imposes himself like a spurned lover on his flimsy celluloid material.

Assayas isn’t just using the stylistic tropes of experimental cinema for expressionistic atmosphere here. Compared to the similarly distressed opening credits of _Se7en_, there’s a greater coherence to René’s black and white film-poem. A torrent of scratches pours from Maggie’s eyes. Her gaze becomes a visual fusillade echoing down from Feuillade’s day. On the one hand, the sequence expresses the impossibility of rejuvenating silent cinema’s ‘innocence’ – a theme alluded to when Vidal damns the idea of the television remake of _Les Vampires_ as ‘blasphemy’. On the other hand it’s about the mystery of cinema’s attraction (the television film is entitled _Les yeux qui fascinent_). Cheung says: ‘Desire. It’s what we make films with.’ But it’s also what makes us watch films. This circuit of desire unites those who cast lifelike shadows on a wall with an audience that re-animates them in their heads.

Another circuit of desire is played out and projected on and off the film set. Zoé (Nathalie Richard), the bisexual costumier, develops a crush on Maggie; Maïté, (Dominique Faysse) the production assistant, attempts to poison Maggie’s attitude to Zoé; Mireille vicariously exploits Zoé’s attraction to Maggie and Vidal himself harbours barely suppressed desires for his lead. When Maggie prowls the hotel corridors in her Irma Vep outfit and steals jewellery from a room, she’s not only losing herself in a character she’ll never perform, she’s also enacting the play of desire that the film so effortlessly works through.

Formerly a critic on _Cahiers du cinéma_, Assayas has made five films before _Irma Vep_. His last, _L’Eau froide_ (1994) was a particularly impressive example of intimate portraiture. But _Irma Vep_ is an experiment that has paid real dividends. Assayas must now be seen as one of the most exciting European filmmakers currently at work.

In Venice, Maggie Cheung briefly met French director Olivier Assayas: ‘It was a vision,’ recalls the latter. ‘I didn’t think contemporary cinema could still produce an actress with such an aura. I felt like a little kid looking at the great stars of the past.’ A year later, Assayas was working on a screenplay about a filmmaker asked to remake Feuillade’s _Les Vampires_, and Cheung’s persona inspired him to flesh out the character of the actress in the ‘Irma Vep’ role (a jewel thief originally played by the French star Musidora). Thinking she would not accept a part in a low-budget French movie, he went through frustrating casting sessions in Hong Kong, until he was again introduced to Cheung. ‘It was her,’ recounts Assayas. ‘She was exactly right for the role, and I thought, if she doesn’t do it, there’s no reason for me to make the film.’ Cheung was as seduced at the prospect of working with Assayas: ‘I really appreciate Olivier, because he doesn’t want me to pretend I am more Chinese than I really am. I am quite westernised, since I have lived in England. I wondered if he had a more “typical Chinese girl” in mind. And he told me, “Don’t ever do that. Just be you.”’

Assayas describes the shooting of _Irma Vep_ as ‘an idyllic experience, because of Maggie’s luminous, almost magical performance. She has an incredible intuition, she knows how to insert herself in a situation, she listens. You tell her one word, one idea, and she immediately assimilates it, makes it more alive, and gives it back to you with an incredible lightness and grace. It may be a cliché, but you have the feeling of playing on a Stradivarius. I was constantly amazed by her pure intelligence, her sweetness and receptiveness. She combined the best of both worlds: the total freedom of independent cinema, and the sovereign poise of a great star.’

In _Irma Vep_, Cheung indeed plays herself, a popular Hong Kong actress landing with flair and elegance amidst a French film crew who don’t really know what to make of her. Director Jean-Pierre Léaud sees her as an exotic version of Musidora, costumier Nathalie Richard falls in love with her, hangers-out admire her beauty, others think she simply doesn’t fit. At the end, she is asked to leave the production. Yet breathtaking images keep haunting those who have surrounded her, until they view the black-and-white footage of the film-within-the-film: as a sensuous and mysterious Irma Vep, Cheung joins the legendary pantheon of the silent era – Louise Brooks, Lillian Gish, Marlene Dietrich – her face and body transcended into light and beauty, pure cinematic signifiers.
