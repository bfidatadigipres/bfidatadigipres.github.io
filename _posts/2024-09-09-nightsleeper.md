_+ Q&A with actors Alexandra Roach and Joe Cole, writer Nick Leather and executive producer Kate Harwood_

_Nightsleeper_ is a real-time thriller for BBC iPlayer and BBC One. Created by BAFTA-winning writer Nick Leather, it is a six-part series in which a train is ‘hackjacked’ and driven through one single night from Glasgow to London on an uncertain journey. Part fast-moving heart-in-mouth action-adventure and part twisty-turny whodunnit detective story, it’s a roller coaster drama where no-one is ever quite who they seem.

Leading the fight are Joe Roag, a cop who is a passenger on the train and Abby Aysgarth, the acting technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). But who are they fighting? And how can they win against the self-styled ‘Driver’ who seems one step ahead of every solution?

There’s a small team working the night shift alongside Abby and a handful of passengers left on the train with Joe but are they all as innocent as you’d think? Who can they trust? Who can we trust? Are there people on board who know more than they are letting on?

**Alexandra Roach** was born in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, Wales. A fluent Welsh speaker, Roach appeared in long-running television soap _Pobol y Cwm_ in her early teens and won Best Juvenile Actor in a Soap at the Children in Entertainment Awards. After leaving the series in 2005, she spent time with the National Youth Theatre of Wales before going on to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating with a B.A. in acting in 2010.

In May 2010 Roach appeared in _The Door Never Closes_ by Rex Obano at the Almeida Theatre. A number of high-profile roles followed, including Sasha in _Being Human_, Beth Partridge in _Candy Cabs_, and _The Suspicions of Mr Whicher_ (in which she played notorious child murderer Constance Kent).

Roach starred as a young Margaret Thatcher in _The Iron Lady_. Other film appearances include: _Anna Karenina_ (2012), _One Chance_ (2013), _Testament of Youth_ (2014), _The Kid Who Would Be King_ (2019), _A Guide to Second Date Sex_ (2019) and _This Is Christmas_ (2022).

She appeared as Helene in Sky Comedy’s _Hunderby_ (2012) and was cast as Molly in the film adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s novel _Private Peaceful._ She was included on the _Screen International_ ‘Stars of Tomorrow’ list in 2011. In 2013, she starred in the British TV series _Utopia_. In the same year, Roach appeared in the ITV comedy _Vicious_, as Ash’s vegan girlfriend Chloe and returned to the role in 2015. In 2014, she appeared in the inaugural episode of the BBC One TV film _Walter_. In 2015 she starred in the TV series _No Offence_ as DS Joy Freers. She has also made appearances in series including _Inside No. 9_, _Black Mirror_ and _Killing Eve_.

Cole’s acting career began when he was accepted into the National Youth Theatre.  He obtained his first roles in a one-night show in the West End, on _The Bill_ and _Holby City_, and then in roles on stage at the Bush Theatre’s sell-out _School Season._ In the 2010s, he wrote a comedy series with Matt Lucas.

From 2013 to 2017, Cole starred as John Shelby in the historical crime drama _Peaky Blinders_. In 2017, he starred in a season 4 episode of Charlie Brooker’s _Black Mirror_, earning a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor.

For his role as Billy Moore in _A Prayer Before Dawn_, Cole won Best Actor at the 2018 British Independent Film Awards.

Previous productions credits include Jimmy McGovern’s drama series _Broken_ (BBC1) and _The Worst Witch_ (CBBC/Netflix), for which he was nominated for a Writers’ Guild Award 2018. He created the children’s drama series _Rocket’s Island_, which ran for three seasons, won a Prix Jeunesse and was BAFTA nominated for ‘Best Children’s Drama’ in 2014 and 2016.

Current original commissions include: _Nightsleeper_ (Euston Films), _Project Insider_ (Kudos), _The Dream Factory_ (Big Talk), _Costa del Criminal_ (Castlefield).
