After being dumped by her partner, Norah moves to the countryside and falls for a local gamekeeper, with dire consequences. This is a perfect case study of the city-slicker moving to the country and finding themselves trapped in the ways of old. For me, Mr Fisher has always been one of the greatest villains, and a character that influenced the pagans in _Starve Acre_; it’s the way he behaves without glee – his despicable acts carried out with the banal behaviour of someone milking cows.

On 10 December 1970, with _Blood on Satan’s Claw_ completed but not yet released and a full two years before _The Wicker Man_ would start production, the BBC’s _Play for Today_ strand broadcast one of the most pure distillations of ‘folk horror’ ever seen, the chilling _Robin Redbreast_ written by John Bowen. Born in Calcutta, India in 1924 Bowen was a hugely prolific writer but he remains one of British television’s least acknowledged writers of horror and fantasy fiction. During the 1960s and 70s he was responsible for _Play of the Week: The Corsican Brothers_ (1965) and _Mystery and Imagination: The Flying Dragon_ (1965) and later as well as creating the science fiction series _The Guardians_ (1971) he would write _Dead of Night: A Woman Sobbing_ (1972), _The Ghost Story for Christmas_ episodes _The Treasure of Abbot Thomas_ (1974) and _The Ice House_ (1978) and another piece of ‘folk horror’ in _Play for Today: A Photograph_ (1977). Good though some of those undoubtedly are (_The Treasure of Abbot Thomas_ in particular), _Robin Redbreast_ remains his masterpiece.

Directed by James MacTaggart, _Robin Redbreast_ stars Anna Cropper as BBC script editor Norah Palmer (entirely coincidentally, the name now can’t help but remind us of Laura Palmer from _Twin Peaks_) who decides to sell up and move to a house in a small village in the south of England. There she meets many of the eccentric locals and begins a relationship with Rob (Anthony Bradford), a very strange young man who practices martial arts in his underpants in the woods. She soon becomes pregnant and, after a last-minute change of heart, cancels her planned abortion to return to the village where it becomes clear that she’s been the pawn in a strange conspiracy and begins to fear for her life and that of her unborn child.

_Robin Redbreast_ suffers the usual problems of a _Play for Today_ (stuffy middle-class characters with their odd ideas – everyone drinks at every slight opportunity and with everything else that’s going on Norah is more concerned that she and Rob are ‘not on social terms’ – there’s a theatricality to some of the studio scenes that contrasts sharply with the more naturalistic scenes shot on location in the village and the cool, detached cynicism of the city-dwellers – ‘Something boring has happened: I appear to be pregnant’ – become a little wearing after a while), but it remains one of the most powerfully affecting of all of the many plays broadcast in the long-running strand. It was daring too – the conspiracy hinges on the disappearance (we later find out that it was stolen by the villagers) of Norah’s contraceptive diaphragm, a development that was too much for the BBC when Bowen first brought them the script for a different strand. It was rejected then but found its natural home in the more progressive _Play for Today_.

Bowen took inspiration for his script from a real-life ritual murder of a farmhand in the English village of Lower Quinton on St Valentine’s Day 1945, also supposedly the inspiration for David Pinner’s 1967 novel _Ritual_ which would be adapted as _The Wicker Man_. It also benefited from a resurgence of interest in Paganism, witchcraft and magic in the late 1960s following the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in the 1950s. Despite the inevitable _Wicker Man_ comparisons threatening to tip you off as to what might happen at the climax, Bowen cleverly pulls the rug at the last minute and it doesn’t quite play out as you might expect. In fact the truth of what the villagers are up to is even more insidious than what you are led to believe might be happening.

Away from the studio setting, the performances are allowed to shine – Bernard Hepton is excellent as the sinister local historian and Freda Bamford steals the show as housekeeper and font of old knowledge Mrs Vigo. She would return as the same character in Bowen’s _A Photograph_, linking the two plays in a rather obscure way – she’s central to the conspiracy in both but exactly how the two relate isn’t quite clear. Anna Cropper’s Norah is rather unlikable at first but during her increasingly frantic attempts to escape the village, thwarted at every turn by the locals, she becomes more sympathetic. Bradford suffers from being burdened with a stock BBC ‘Mummerset’ accent but makes a decent fist of the essentially decent (despite an obsession with Nazi history) but dull young man whose role in the conspiracy provides the play’s biggest shock.

The play was repeated two months later to allow viewers who had been struck by a widespread power cut in December 1970 could finally get to see it in its entirety. It exists today only as a black and white 16mm telecine recording, the original colour videotape having been wiped for re-use, as was the norm back then. Though this would normally be a cause for concern, in this instance, the slightly soft, detached air of the telerecording adds to the weird, dreamlike atmosphere.

Rescued from obscurity by the BFI who issued it on a well stocked DVD as part of their 2013 Gothic season, _Robin Redbreast_ is one of those rare previously ‘lost’ television plays that actually lives up to the half-faded memories of those who saw it the first time around. Its place in the still only partially recorded history of ‘folk horror’ has been assured and its wider availability reminds us of just how daring and provocative British television could be in the 1970s.
