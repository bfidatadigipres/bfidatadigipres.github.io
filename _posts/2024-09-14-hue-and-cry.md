In the forties, before the establishment of the specialist Children’s Film Foundation, the commercial arm of the British film industry still sometimes made films especially for children, and _Hue and Cry_ is the best example. The production company, Ealing Studios, had a well-established style, and _Hue and Cry_ was the first time it was adapted for children. The result was hugely successful in Saturday matinees in the forties.

The project began not with a well known book or a famous star, but with a climactic scene which associate producer Henry Cornelius had seen in his mind’s eye. Passing it on to writer Clarke, he said: ‘I see a sequence in which hundreds of boys take possession of London for a few glorious hours.’ Clarke’s job was to invent characters, and a storyline, which would logically lead up to that climax.

True to Ealing’s ‘realist’ style, the boys (and the one girl) in _The Blood and Thunder Boys_ are nothing like American cute-moppet child stars of the thirties (e.g. Shirley Temple and Jackie Coogan). For a start, they are older, because in 1946 it was illegal in the UK for children under the age of 14 to work in the film business. Harry Fowler (who plays Joe) and the rest of the young actors were therefore 15, 16, 17 or more when they acted as Joe, Alec, Norman, Dicky, Arthur and Clarry, etc.

There were also some positive Ealing choices that gave the film its distinctive look. One was that Joe has an ordinary family, with a father who reads the newspaper while eating, a mother who tells him to wipe the sausage off his chin, and a sister always talking about her new dress. Further, when the boys get on the trail of the master criminal, they make mistakes in working things out, and they argue and fight among themselves. Such behaviour and such a background were not then common among screen children.

Another prominent aspect of the film’s style is its semi-documentary approach. A good example is the scene at Covent Garden market where Joe has to learn to carry a tower of baskets on his head. Clarke and director Crichton agreed in wanting lots of scenes to be shot in authentic London locations, rather than inside a studio. Bomb-sites, dockland and St Paul’s also figure in the film quite a lot, so that as well as being an exciting adventure, _Hue and Cry_ is also a good way of seeing what London looked like just after World War II.

Apart from Harry Fowler, none of the youngsters had any previous acting experience. Cornelius and Crichton talked to youth clubs, asked for volunteers and then had to test over 1,000 boys before selecting a few who could handle dialogue and acting. One of them, James Crabb, was found to be so good at doing imitations of all kinds of noises that Clarke wrote a special part for him, bringing this talent into the story. After that search, the 300 extras needed at the end of the story were easier to find, because they weren’t required to act; all they had to do was swarm all over the place, and ‘take possession of London.’ Most of them came from Boy Scout troops.

When the film was finished Clarke was very pleased with it, declaring it ‘a far better story on celluloid that it was at any stage on paper.’

Though by no means the first comedy to emerge from Ealing studios, _Hue and Cry_ was among the first British comedies after the war, and is generally considered the first of what are now remembered as the ‘Ealing comedies’ – although the cycle really got underway two years later with the release of _Passport to Pimlico_, _Whisky Galore!_ and _Kind_ _Hearts and Coronets_.

The story of a group of East End kids who foil a gang of robbers who are using a children’s comic to communicate their plans, _Hue and Cry_ borrows something of its premise from the popular children’s story _Emil and the Detectives_ (first filmed in Germany in 1931).

While the story has an appealing _Boy’s Own_ quality, perhaps the film’s most distinctive feature is its use of bombed-out locations in London’s East End and Docklands. These rubble-strewn sites become the background for one grand boy’s adventure (the children include only one girl – who is just about tolerated by the others), culminating in the film’s best known image, in which hundreds of boys from all over London converge on a handful of unfortunate petty criminals.

In keeping with Ealing’s tendency in the last years of the war to foster inclusive images of British society, the children are mostly working-class, and include a young Scottish boy, Alec (Douglas Barr).

Jack Warner, who within a few years would be well-known to TV audiences as the honest and steadfast PC George Dixon in Ealing’s _The Blue Lamp_ (1950) and the TV series _Dixon of Dock Green_ (1955-76), took the most substantial adult role as the villain, Nightingale. Apart from a memorable cameo from Alastair Sim as _The_ _Trump_’s eccentric author, the rest of the major parts are taken by the children, led by Harry Fowler as Joe, the fantasist whose daydreams become real.

_Hue and Cry_ was the first of seven comedies for the studio by T.E.B. Clarke, the writer whose work, including _Passport to Pimlico_ and _The Lavender Hill Mob_ (1951), did most to shape the way the Ealing comedies are usually remembered today – as cheery celebrations of English (even though two of the films are set in Scotland) community spirit and mild eccentricity.
