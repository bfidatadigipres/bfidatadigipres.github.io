_Uncle Silas and Maud Ruthyn_ first appeared in 1864 as a serial in the _Dublin University Magazine_, before being published in three volumes as _Uncle Silas: A Tale of Bartram-Haugh_. The author, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, is best remembered for perfecting the ‘psychological’ ghost story (_Green Tea_, _Carmilla_, etc.), but in _Uncle Silas_ he wrote a _Jane Eyre_-flavoured ‘sensation’ novel dubbed by David Punter ‘the first properly Gothic masterpiece in England since _Melmoth the Wanderer_.’

In 1947, Le Fanu’s novel was filmed twice. Carlos Schlieper’s _El misterioso tío Sylas_, starring Elisa Galvé, opened in Argentina in May. Its British counterpart was the brainchild of producer/designer Laurence Irving. As the grandson of Henry Irving he was perhaps predisposed to melodrama of the gas lit Lyceum variety. Charles Frank, best known for his innovative dubbing of foreign films, made his début as director and Ben Travers was hired to write the dialogue, despite having sent up the ‘old dark house’ genre in his 1927 stage hit _Thark_. ‘One can believe,’ sneered the _Observer_, ‘that Mr Travers, who is known and loved as a rollicking farceur, shied violently at having to adapt a lurid, melodramatic novel by this Anglo-Irish Goth of a boy.’

Production got underway at Denham at Christmas 1946. Jean Simmons, whose character underwent a name-change from Maud to Caroline, turned 18 during filming, on 31 January. She also had her voice lowered an octave or two by Molly Terraine, head of the recently formed Rank Company of Youth (the so-called ‘Charm School’). On the film’s release in October, Simmons was made the focal point of its publicity drive (‘Make your patrons JEAN CONSCIOUS – she’s a great young actress,’ urged the pressbook) and, indeed, garnered most of the best notices. By comparison to Simmons’ ‘charming, simple performance,’ observed Elspeth Grant, ‘It would be difficult to think of anything funnier than Mr Derrick de Marney’s study of a Wicked Uncle – unless, perhaps, it were Mme Katina Paxinou’s portrait of a Fiend in Human Form.’

Reviews were dismissive almost across the board: ‘one of the most nonsensical films I have seen for years’ (_Daily Express_); ‘the sort of British film that makes me long, if you can imagine it, for Leslie Arliss and his wicked ladies,’ (_News Chronicle_); ‘the film jostles _Jassy_ for first place as the most preposterous piece of melodrama screened this year’ (_Daily Graphic_). William Whitebait took a more tolerant view in the _New Statesman_, noting that ‘the trouble with _Uncle Silas_ is that a corpulent Gothic-domestic tale has been squeezed of nearly all save its melodramatic backbone ... But the resulting shocker isn’t a quarter as silly as most of the reviewers have exclaimed.’ _Variety_, however, made the dire prediction that ‘this laboured hokum can add little to British prestige. It’s not for export.’ Indeed, over three years would elapse before the film’s US release in February 1951; retitled _The Inheritance_, it was described by _The_ _New York Times_ as containing ‘some of the most atrociously archaic melodrama in recent memory.’

Perhaps the animosity which greeted the film can be ascribed to the fact that, prior to Hammer’s explosive arrival in the late 1950s, the words ‘British’ and ‘horror’ seemed mutually exclusive. The distinguished example of _Dead of Night_ had failed to establish a consistent post-war trend towards films in a similar vein. With horror going underground once more, plumbing the murky depths of threadbare second features like _Castle Sinister_ and _The Ghost of Rashmon Hall_, the big-budget _Uncle Silas_ must have seemed like a freakish caprice.

Seen now, however, the film has much to recommend it. Boiling down Le Fanu’s sprawling saga to its bare bones, Travers’ script makes it crystal clear that Bram Stoker’s _Dracula_ owes a considerable debt to Le Fanu’s narrative structure, with a female Jonathan Harker imprisoned in a gloomy old house by a white-haired old man who intends to kill her. The film also gives the celebrated Greek actress Katina Paxinou a classic ‘face at the window’ entrance and features much arresting montage work from Frank together with stunning sets, alternately baronial and dilapidated, from Irving. Robert Krasker’s cinematography brilliantly contrasts the airy shafts of sunlight in Caroline’s ancestral home with the hellish stripes of firelight characterising Silas’, and the film’s only real drawbacks are its unwieldy length and underwhelming title character.

‘Mr de Marney looks exactly what he is – a youngish actor dressed up as an old man,’ said the _Daily Herald_ of the 40-year-old matinée idol, who at no point suggests what Le Fanu called Silas’ ‘baleful effulgence.’ As white-haired Gothic recluses go, Silas, with his ‘face like marble ... [and] fearful monumental look,’ is clearly the missing link between Poe’s ethereal Roderick Usher and Stoker’s carnal Count Dracula, but you wouldn’t know it from the wasp-waisted comic-opera villain provided by de Marney.

Le Fanu’s story has since resurfaced at 20-year intervals. Thames TV’s rendition for the long-running _Mystery and Imagination_ series, with Robert Eddison, Patience Collier and Lucy Fleming, appeared in November 1968, while the BBC’s _The Dark Angel_ was shown in three parts (replicating the original’s three volumes) in January 1989 and starred Peter O’Toole, Jane Lapotaire and Beatie Edney. Hammer veteran Barbara Shelley was Cousin Monica and Guy Rolfe – Sepulchre Hawkes in 1947 – appeared this time as  Dr Bryerly.
