_The Hunger_ helped challenge my perception of what dark fantasy could be. It didn’t have to be epic in scale, but by employing a quieter register and mood it was possible to weave an entrancing story. It’s a film that oozes gothic style thanks to its incredible cinematography and production design. If you didn’t already know, it stars David Bowie as an aged vampire whose no less voluptuous lover, played by Catherine Deneuve, is drawn to Susan Sarandon’s gerontologist.  
**Daniel Kokotajlo**  

Often lambasted as an exercise in style over content, Tony Scott’s take on the vampire genre is indeed a little showy, though given Scott’s background in TV commercials it’s perhaps not surprising. Pop-video clichés from the 1980s abound: doves fluttering among drapery, Bauhaus singing ‘Bela Lugosi’s Dead’ in a goth club, soft-core lesbian scenes and even a rollerblader grooving to Iggy Pop amid dry ice. But despite this _The Hunger_ has dated surprisingly well. Catherine Deneuve is convincing as a centuries-old vampire in modern New York, and David Bowie turns in an unusually understated performance as her doomed lover. The influence of Nic Roeg is in evidence here, in particular that of Roeg and Donald Cammell’s _Performance_ and the Bowie vehicle _The Man Who Fell to Earth_.  
**Ronnie Hackston, _Sight and Sound_, December 2004**  

As Ridley Scott was preparing _Blade Runner_, a script came to his agent for a film called _The Hunger_. Ridley’s agent is also Tony’s, and as the one Scott was busy the project was suggested for his brother, who had been working on a screenplay called _My Dog’s on Fire_ by David Peoples (‘very strange, set in the year 3000, basically about gangs of kids called Mousepacks patrolling the streets of New York’). Tony Scott, who in partnership with Ridley has been making commercials ever since he emerged from the Royal College of Art, created two films for the BFI Production Board but has otherwise found his career thwarted by the collapse of two major productions, cancelled at the last minute – one for Paramount, the other for Filmways. He met Dick Shepherd, head of production at MGM in the era of _The Goodbye Girl_, _Fame_ and _Clash of the Titans_, by the time-honoured process of sitting next to him in a plane, and when Shepherd saw a reel of his commercials (‘What really got to me was the Hovis and the Lee Cooper jeans’) there was no problem with _The Hunger_, which turned out to be a Shepherd project.

As it happens, _The Hunger_ is a film about accelerated ageing and the hunt for eternal life. Based on a novel by Whitley Streiber (who wrote _Wolfen_), it stars Catherine Deneuve as an immortal being masquerading as human, who drifts through the centuries in parasitical symbiosis with a succession of lovers.  Her current partner, played by David Bowie, discovers that he has reached the limit of the extended youthfulness his mistress has been able to confer upon him, and begins to decline rapidly into senility. They find in New York a specialist in gerontology (Susan Sarandon), who is researching the possible reversal of the ageing process, and she is drawn into the ménage with interestingly horrific results.

Scott admits cheerfully that the death-in-life theme has always fascinated him. Both his BFI films, _One of the Missing_ and _Loving Memory_, poised their central characters on the edge of death, and for _The Hunger_ the shells of unburied corpses preserved in an eerie semi-death at the Mexican town of Guanajuato (and in attendance at the credits of Herzog’s _Nosferatu_) were a particular inspiration. Echoing _Blade Runner_, _The Hunger_ includes references to progeria, an appalling disease whose ten-year-old victims have the physical characteristics of people in their seventies, and to the centres which already exist for life-prolongation. ‘We place the Susan Sarandon character in a “sleep clinic” modelled on those places in California where they believe that through sleep pattern and diet you can stretch your life by 15 to 20 years. There’s one in Austria, where they actually recycle your blood.’

There could be other cross-references between the two Scott films by the time _The Hunger_ is finished. Both productions have their allusions to ancient Egypt, both indulge in symbolism by means of a white dove (and with equal risk), and both have been shot through the gentle haze of smoke that seems to be a Scott trademark and which guarantees stunning quality of camerawork. Both films are themselves replicants of a kind, shot-for-shot simulacra of the detailed storyboards which the Scotts, each a brilliant designer, prepare in advance, drawing out their films on paper like miniature _Heavy Metal_ comic strips. Above all, both films rely on a wholly modern artifice, the often invisible application of special effects to impersonate reality. For _The Hunger_, the puppetmaster is Dick Smith, who in 35 years has altered states for everyone from Dan Curtis to Ken Russell and for everything from _The Cardinal_ to _The Exorcist_. Linda Blair’s revolving head, Marlon Brando’s jowls in _The Godfather_, De Niro’s bloodbath at the end of _Taxi Driver_, Katharine Ross’ ‘double’ in _Stepford Wives_, Smith has faked them all. Turning David Bowie into a 200-year-old for _The Hunger_ has been no more daunting than making veins burst from the faces of the contestants in _Scanners_.

‘The quantum leap,’ says Smith, ‘has been in the last dozen years. Now everybody wants make-up illusions, and the technical and chemical developments have come up with the materials for us to do the job. We discovered, for example, that the cleaning fluid trichloroethane causes foam latex to swell, and so we could raise words on Linda Blair’s skin in _The Exorcist_ or make an actor’s face burst open from snake venom in _Death Bite_. It’s no problem for us to make any kinds of limbs and do anything to them. We can make entire people if need be. Make them wholesale.’
