_We are pleased to welcome writer and poet, Hannah Lowe, who joins this event and discuss her life and work in connection to the life and work of Claude McKay. We are also really pleased to welcome Jason Allen-Paisant (Jamaican poet, writer and academic) and Colin Grant (director of WritersMosaic). Panel discussion hosted by actor-director Burt Caesar._

A rebellious figure of the Harlem Renaissance and champion of the ’new world’ African, poet and novelist Claude McKay wandered the world for much of his early life, frequenting the artistic and political avant-gardes while creating an enduring body of work. This stunning documentary portrait is richly illustrated, drawing on rare film and photographic footage, featuring insightful interviews and accompanied by a stirring soundtrack.
