**Edgar Wright:** I wanted to ask about the last film, in terms of chronology, on the list: _The Legend of Hell House_. I’ve always loved it and I always think it’s interesting because Pamela Franklin is in both _The Legend of Hell House_ and _The Innocents_ [1961]. To me, _The Innocents_ is one of the most subtle evocative horror films, whereas _The Legend of Hell House_ as a counterpoint is like John Hough hitting you in the face with a brick – in a great way! It’s all those low wide angle shots.

**Martin Scorsese:** Well, that’s the style of it. It’s a serious horror film. It really is. It didn’t evade the issue by shocking cuts and what they call now jump scares. It really placed you in that house and it had a creepy feel to it, especially the ghost who takes down the covers of the bed, and then she gets in the bed and then they find her in the morning and she’s got scratches on her. It had a sense of a deeper element of evil. The sense of evil in that house – it’s titillating in terms of the eroticism of the picture, and what do you do with those wide angle lenses as you say. It certainly was a companion piece for me for _The Haunting_ [1963].

The eerie world of the unknown, psychic phenomena the things that go bump in the night are given a fascinating new dimension in _The Legend of Hell House_.

In planning the production of Richard Matheson’s screenplay based upon his best-selling novel, the late James H. Nicholson, President of Academy Pictures, made it clear from the beginning that this would not be just another haunted house movie. There were to be no ghostly clichés: none of the creaking doors, flapping shutters and hooting owls scare routines of the past. This tale of a house in the grip of a ‘supernormal’ force would show for the first time on the screen a kind of psychic warfare involving theories scientists say could well be true.

The terrifying battle between evil forces and the exorcistic counter-forces directed against them would in no way be treated as fantasy. ‘We will play the whole thing for all-out real,’ became Nicholson’s _Hell House_ theme for the producers, director and actors.

To fill the roles of the four investigators of what may or may not be ghostly presences in a Victorian mansion outside of London, Nicholson chose Pamela Franklin, Roddy McDowall, Clive Revill and Gayle Hunnicutt. For Miss Franklin, it was a return to the world of ghosts she inhabited as a child actress in her very first movie, _The Innocents_. In that she played a child possessed.

Albert Fennell, who co-produced with Norman T. Herman, is credited with more than 50 films and 100 television productions, including the internationally popular _The Avengers_ series. One of his most acclaimed films was _The Innocents_,  in which he and Pamela Franklin first shared ectoplasmic experiences.

It was during the making of _The Avengers_ that Fennell met a young technician and was so impressed with his enthusiasm and intelligence that he gave him his first directing assignment. The technician was John Hough, director of _Hell House_, whose last effort was directing Orson Welles in a new version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s _Treasure Island_. Hough calls _The Legend of Hell House_ a hard film to define. ‘It’s not a horror movie and it’s not fantasy. It’s certainly a terrifying thriller – but a thriller with a difference.’

What attracted him to the project was its realism, says Hough. ‘I’ve been involved with psychic investigators and they all assure me that the theory about hauntings and psychic phenomena it puts forward could be true. Scientists don’t discount the theory either. There could be such a power as that described in the story and according to scientific experts, it could be eliminated in the way shown in the film. So we’re not presenting something that is outrageous or false, but examining a theory seriously accepted by many scientists as possible.’

To ensure that scenes involving psychic phenomena accord with what is factually known about the subject, Nicholson engaged Tom Corbett, England’s most famous clairvoyant and psychic consultant, to act as technical advisor. For location scenes, Corbett was also asked to find an English country house, genuinely reputed to be haunted, and resembling architecturally, the one described in Richard Matheson’s story.

Corbett suggested Wykehurst Park, a gabled Victorian mansion in heavily wooded countryside 50 miles south of London. Like the house in the film, Wykehurst, empty for 40 years, was built by a wealthy industrialist a hundred years ago. And, according to Corbett, an area outside, leading up to the front door, is haunted by the ghost of an elderly gentleman in a frock coat. ‘Who or what he is I do not know,’ says Corbett, ‘but I see him walking agitatedly up to the door and then vanishing.’

The ghost’s area of operation seems to be confined to a ‘lane’ about 15 yards long and two yards wide, Corbett calculates. Inside this lane there is an icy-cold atmosphere, which stops right outside the front door. Corbett found no trace of any ‘chill’ on the other side of the threshold, which suggested to him that ‘something happened to the old gentleman on the doorstep, and that he never got inside the house.’

‘I do not get the impression that he came to a violent end,’ Corbett states. ‘But I do get this feeling of tremendous agitation, as if what he was doing was a matter of life or death, that, perhaps, he was trying to warn somebody, or prevent something happening.’

In nearby villages stories still persist that around the end of the last century a skeleton was found in the basement of the house, although local police records show no evidence of this. One explanation is that the discovery of the skeleton was hushed up at the time.
