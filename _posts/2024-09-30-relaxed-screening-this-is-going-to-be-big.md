Giving a voice to a group of extraordinary young people as they prepare to stage a musical about the life of Australian pop singer John Farnham, this upbeat documentary reveals the limitations of mainstream stereotypes. Filmed at a high-school where neurodivergent and disabled teenagers are enabled to thrive, we follow them and their families as they prepare for the big day.

The post screening discussion will be led by new collective Stims to celebrate this unique representation of neurodiversity.
