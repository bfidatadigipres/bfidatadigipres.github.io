**Olivier Assayas on ‘Clean’**

_Was it very different writing about a character for Maggie to play as opposed to writing about her ‘as’ herself in_ Irma Vep _?_

For _Irma Vep_ I was using the obvious images I had of her – I’d only met her a couple of times. It was really Maggie as ‘Maggie Cheung the Hong Kong cinema superstar’. So it was about the fantasies you build on the surface of movie stars. But after _Irma Vep_ I felt I owed it to her to make a film about her real self. She told me she was getting all the credit for _Irma Vep_, when really it was her co-star Nathalie Richard who should have got the praise, because what she was doing was so much more lively and complex. In many ways I agreed, because the humanity of Nathalie’s character is ultimately what makes the film.

Somehow I always felt I owed it to Maggie to give her a part that would use her deeper, more human side. But it’s difficult, because she’s a very complex character and can only be in very specific parts because of the strange mix of cultures she is. In _Clean_ what I was interested in was the geographic and cultural fragmentation of this individual. Emily is like Maggie in that she’s all over the place – part Chinese, part British, part French; she’s part of a globalised culture, a story happening on two different continents, in four different cities. And I realised that if I wanted to put all these things together, I’d need something as simple as it gets in terms of a story arc.

_You say in your press notes that you wanted a project where Maggie wasn’t seen as a Chinese woman in a western film. But if it hadn’t been for Maggie, would Emily still have been Chinese?_

No, though the fact that Emily happened to be Chinese made her more interesting, less conventional. And the reason for the simplicity of the story is the complexity of Emily – if she’s less complex, the simplicity of the storyline becomes a little thin.

_The scenes where she descends from the fantasy world of rock aristocracy to work as a waitress for her uncle play poignantly on Chinese notions of status._

Like all modern Chinese, Emily becomes herself by cutting off her ties to traditional thinking and the values of the family, which can be extremely tough, especially for women. I always had the idea that the lowest Emily can go is to be reabsorbed by her community in the most limiting way.

_Both_ Clean _and_ Irma Vep _are about deglamorising – about a character stepping down from the gods. In_ Irma Vep _Maggie arrives in Paris and she’s just sitting in an office somewhere in a different world. It’s very much at odds with the glamour of the Hong Kong movie goddess._

To me in _Irma Vep_ she never loses that glamour because even if you put her in an office or a back alley her character is always gracious – she has an aura. In _Clean_ it’s more about someone who has let herself become a rock ‘n’ roll stereotype and in the process has forgotten who she really is. The arc of the film is about what happens when the bubble bursts.

People ask me if I was inspired by someone like Courtney Love or Yoko Ono, and I say no – I’m not inspired by them, though the character herself is. She has at the back of her mind the stereotype of the woman who is a terrible influence on her artist/musician boyfriend and ends up trapped in that part.

But Emily’s character gradually comes to light – not just to us but to herself. When she begins to reconstruct herself she starts from scratch; it’s like someone trying to walk in the dark. For me it’s not about getting her son back or getting off drugs, it’s simply about understanding who she is again.

Clean _strikes me as one of the few films about rock to deal convincingly with its deep-down mundanity – another example being Paul Schrader’s_ Light of Day _._

I like _Light of Day_. I thought Joan Jett was great in it. I was a little intimidated when I realised I’d have to deal with that sort of indie-rock background: it’s very difficult, and no one gets it right. I thought the only way to do it was to use real musicians, have people play their characters – they’re not stars, they’re just people who are famous within their own world.

I kept on using them as consultants. I kept asking James Johnston, ‘Would you do this, is this believable?’, or I’d ask David Roback, ‘Would you put the mike there, where would you be sitting?’, or I’d ask Tricky, ‘Who would you speak to, who would you not speak to, do you sit on your own in your car, what sort of people are around you?’ I tried to put them in an ambience they would recognise and accept as totally believable. If you get one detail wrong, it’s the one thing that will stand out and make you look like a fool. It’s not cool.

_What’s surprising is how much you leave out – despite the title, you make very little of the painful process of Emily coming off smack._

I don’t want to dramatise drugs and I don’t want to dramatise getting off drugs. For me the painful part is not what you usually see in film, where people are raving mad and hitting their head on the wall because they’re in pain from withdrawal. For me the issue of getting off drugs is more about dealing with the inner pain of being yourself. People don’t take drugs for fun, but because they need them, because there’s something within themselves they can’t deal with. So when you get off drugs you have to face the same problems that made you a junkie in the first place. The physical issue of withdrawal has been shown a million times in films and I don’t think it’s interesting.

_There’s a wonderful incongruity in the cast list – seeing Maggie Cheung, Nick Nolte, Beatrice Daile and Don McKellar credited together really makes you wonder what sort of film you’re going to see._

I’ve always been excited by the short-circuit you create by putting together people who are not supposed to meet. Like when I was doing _Paris s’éveille_ (1991) I was excited by the notion of having Jean-Pierre Léaud and John Cale on the same credits list – having John Cale score a Parisian film about kids. _Irma Vep_ was my first shot at expanding that policy. The premise was, ‘Maggie Cheung comes to Paris and meets Jean-Pierre Léaud, what do they have to say to each other?’
