Peter Yates’ first American movie is memorable less for its plot – about a San Francisco cop trying to track down a crucial witness in a Mafia trial – than for its dramatic use of the city’s locations and for an exhilarating extended car-chase. (McQueen hired Yates – formerly a manager for Stirling Moss – to direct after seeing the car-chase in his film Robbery.) An influential landmark in action cinema.

**A contemporary review**  
The slogan would again appear to be Go West Young Man. Almost every month, it seems, some striking new ‘first’ film from the other side of the Atlantic comes from a director who has achieved only modest or intermittent success in Britain. _Bullitt_ may not have quite the impact of _Point Blank_, but it is a highly creditable effort as a relatively young English director’s first American film. Indeed, even from a native American the sense of involvement in the milieu and the environment would have been remarkable, and despite the apparently unhelpful background of RADA and provincial repertory, Peter Yates also appears to have assimilated that special brand of violence which most Europeans think of as specifically American. And perhaps because not a native Californian, he has also succeeded in presenting a picture of that Mecca of the new moviemakers, San Francisco, which is at once fresh and believable.

Basically, _Bullitt_ is a well-made but fairly conventional and slightly overlong film about the duel between an incorruptible policeman and a politically ambitious district attorney for possession of the key prosecution witness in a racket-busting hearing. What distinguishes it from many of its kind is the vivid sense of background, and of life going on all around. Since both star and director have professional motor-racing experience – and a car chase was the high spot of Yates’s previous film, _Robbery_ – it is perhaps not surprising that the long car chase in _Bullitt_ is among the most exciting ever filmed. Similarly, the initial shotgun slaying of the supposed witness in the run-down hotel is perhaps the most violent screen killing since one character was literally blasted out of his boots in the _The Left Handed Gun._

But Yates’s greatest success is with the sequences at the hospital and at San Francisco airport. In the intensive-care unit to which the dying witness and his badly injured police bodyguard are taken, and where a bitter three-cornered battle of wits is waged between the detective, the suave politician and the grey-haired professional killer bent on completing a bungled contract, one is vividly aware of the normal hospital routine proceeding all around. Rarely have blood-drips and all the frightening impedimenta of modern surgery been put to more dramatic or seemingly casual use or the audience been made so aware of the very smells of a surgical ward. And the final sequences at the airport convey both the bustle and feel of muted expectancy common to the concourses of all great airports, and the beauty of the great jets manoeuvring by night on the runways among which _Bullitt_ and his prey play out the last deadly game of hide-and-seek. Throughout, the director’s controlled and economical use of violence is equalled by the sureness with which he conveys the atmosphere of violence about to erupt, especially in crowded public places. There is one shot of a closed door about to burst open to permit bloody murder which is frightening in the intensity it engenders.
