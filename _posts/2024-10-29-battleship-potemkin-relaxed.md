Eisenstein challenged cinematic form in his second film, an essential revolutionary classic. Dramatising the true story of the mutiny aboard the Potemkin, the filmmaker integrated bold imagery with radical use of editing that would become known as Soviet Montage and would inspire generations of filmmakers. 

In the context of our Art of Action season, we will explore the power of gesture and association in storytelling.

The post screening discussion will be led by Georgia Kumari Bradburn of Stims Collective.
