This one-of-a-kind, completely insane film follows a disillusioned conspiracy theorist who believes that aliens have infiltrated society and plan to destroy Earth during the next lunar eclipse. He’s convinced his old boss holds the key to stopping the aliens, so he and his devoted circus-performer girlfriend kidnap and torture the man for a confession. Blurring the line between reality and delusion, Jang Joon-hwan’s extraordinary feature debut is a riot of humour and environmental concern.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Jang Joon-hwan comes from the generation that entered the Korean film industry after the political change of 1993; he studied at the Korean Academy of Film Arts, where his graduation project _2001: Imagine_ was a portrait of a Korean slacker who comes to believe he’s the reincarnation of John Lennon. He spent more than two years nurturing the script of _Save the Green Planet!_ (his debut feature), investing it with an attention to detail and a range of reference rare in Korean cinema. The film did disappointing business on its release but quickly became a cult phenomenon: its fans launched an independent website and began showing up en masse at screenings, sometimes in costume.

Far from being unsure where it is going, _Save the Green Planet!_ is a complex but entirely coherent lament for the fate of Jang’s generation, born and raised in a Korea run like a military dictatorship in which violence was institutionalised in schools and borstals, in which political opposition and labour activism were crushed with extreme prejudice and in which civilians were slaughtered on the streets of Kwangju in a Korean anticipation of China’s Tiananmen Square massacre. The most brilliant of Jang’s many smart ideas is to frame this lament as a dark comedy. It takes its tone, colour and basic narrative drive from the Hollywood/Hong Kong action-adventures the protagonist remembers so fondly from his childhood – it even ends with a tacky apocalyptic fantasy straight out of his dying dreams – but it is not itself a conventional genre movie.

The film pulls off an extraordinary, Hitchcockian feat in seeking and maintaining empathy with a protagonist who turns out to be seriously damaged. Lee Byung Gu is introduced as a harmless fantasist, projecting alien conspiracy theories on to the hated figure of an immoral captain of industry. But when he kidnaps and tortures the man, this bumbling social inadequate is gradually shown to be a crystal-meth-fuelled serial killer who feeds corpses to his pet dog and keeps severed parts of his victims in specimen jars. A climactic montage reveals the lifetime of physical abuse that has made him the man he is, and incidentally shows that his first girlfriend was mown down in the Kwangju massacre. The character is less a Korean Norman Bates than a cipher for the real-life horrors his generation lived through.

**A unique perspective on extraterrestrials**  
Utilising the imagination of science-fiction, this is a film that critiques society. In Hollywood films or Western society aliens usually just provide entertainment value. However, the aliens in director Jang Joon-hwan’s film speak to modern reality. This is not a film about the future; it may be described as an ‘analogue’ science-fiction comedy set in the present. Completely new subjects, unpredictable characters... the director set to shake up the 21st century says: Is it aliens from a distant planet trying to destroy the planet? Or is it just us?

**Freshly imagined comedy meets suspense!**  
This film’s originality stems from the freedom of an imagination that criss-crosses fiction and reality. When animation-like fantasy meets well-drawn drama, intriguing emotions are the result. One moment incites a guffaw, the next a tear. Suddenly you are plunged into terror, but then you empathise with the character’s sadness. Recalling Charlie Chaplin in films, laughs are not produced by one-liners, but by the suspenseful comedy itself.

**Not a superhero, just an average man**  
Our main character Byung Gu is completely unlike any superhero. But he is still a hero. He does not process Superman’s cloak or Spiderman’s webs: all he has is a blind belief of mankind. And actually, outside of the movies, it is the job of ordinary people to keep peace on earth.

**The ordinary is just a cover for the exceptional**  
Hollywood-style science-fiction excels in showing off future worlds and virtual spaces created with the most advanced computer graphics. This science fiction film’s stylistic signature however, may be its emphasis on drama and emotional pitch.

A visual marker for the film’s unique imagination can be found in the Earth Defence Headquarters. From the outside, the home is like many a traditional home that can be found in the countryside of Korea. On the inside however, it is a fantastical mission control centre. Furthermore, through the use of suspenseful editing, inventive visuals and unusual sounds (à la Jean-Pierre Jeunet), the film delivers a peculiar brand of entertainment fantasy.
