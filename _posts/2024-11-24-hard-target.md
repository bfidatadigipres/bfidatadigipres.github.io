_+ intro by Ti Singh, BFI FAN season producer (Wednesday 27 November only)_

John Woo’s first US film paired him with the ‘muscles from Brussels’, Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose flamboyant and balletic fighting style perfectly suited the filmmaker’s wildly imaginative approach to action, which never lets up. But there’s also a thoughtful plot here, which adds further jeopardy to the firepower and pyrotechnics.  
**Dick Fiddy, bfi.org.uk**  

An action-packed remake of Ernest B. Schoedsack’s _The Most Dangerous Game_, _Hard Target_ was penned by a young screenwriter Chuck Pfarrer, who turned to Hollywood after seven years in the Navy (Yes, I have killed men. I was in combat in Lebanon for nine months’). Two of his screenplays have been turned into films: the eminently forgettable _Navy Seals_, and more importantly Sam Raimi’s cult horror film _Darkman_. Pfarrer has ‘a deal’ at Universal, and one day he received a phone call: ‘They said they were running something for me in the screening room... It was _The Killer_. When I carne out I said I was convinced, and the next thing I knew I was on a plane to Hong Kong to meet John [Woo]’.

The plot of _Hard Target_ is simple, even cartoonish, with a hard-boiled romanticism that must have appealed to John Woo. A young woman Natasha (Yancy Butler) comes to New Orleans to look for her long-lost father. She meets Chance Boudreaux (Van Darnme), an unemployed seaman who, needing $217 to pay his union dues and board the next departing ship, agrees to help her. He uncovers the unpleasant activities of an elegant piece of Euro-trash (Lance Henriksen) and his side-kick, a white South African psycho (Arnold Vosloo), who for a substantial fee hire out homeless war veterans for rich men to hunt down in the swamps. Chance’s snooping angers the villains, who set him up as prey for their clients.

The script has pages on nine different colours – one for every draft. Pfarrer is on the set, day in, day out, at hand for the rewrites. ‘John knows his stuff. For a writer, it’s fantastic. What we’re ending up with is much better than what I wrote.’ For example, Woo has transformed a chase scene into a stunt never attempted on film before, a head-on collision, almost lyrical in its choreographed violence, between a motorcycle and a car. Yet he keeps on soliciting Pfarrer’s advice, with his usual generosity and modesty. As Pfarrer explains. ‘Hong Kong and US action films have different rules: an American hero would never use a knife ­– unless he’s taking it away from the bad guy – and if the bad guy is hanging from a cliff, the good guy has to help him.’ But Pfarrer is there for another reason too: ‘I’m learning at the feet of a master. I’m in line to direct myself. Before I came here and saw John work, I thought I might be ready, bur now, I just want to watch him.’

Other changes have been made to suit Van Damme’s style. ‘We’ve had to adjust the diaIogue for him,’ says Pfarrer, ‘and we’ve lost some bits of subtlety. However, he’s a very physical actor, who comes alive on the screen and can project emotions without saying a word. Like a young Steve McQueen. And he’s more charming than many action stars. He’s attractive: he could be a matinee idol.’

While a bit corny in the intimate scenes, Van Damme’s ponytail looks great when he’s flying through the air in slow motion. Hunted by an impressive array of cars and motorcycles, he seeks shelter inside an abandoned sugar mill. A thug follows him. Suddenly, a motorcycle in flames mounted by a leather-clad puppet representing the dead villain bursts through a large window. ‘We ran a cable and slid the motorcycle along it,’ explains [special effects co-ordinator] Dale Martin. The spectacular stunt was performed only once, but for such scenes Woo runs six or seven cameras simultaneously, offering long takes from different angles that will later be spliced together in an orgy of fire, explosion and motion.

Back on the plantation while the experts are putting the final touches to their pyrotechnics, the motorcycle stuntmen are at work. Henrikson and Vosloo are leading the pack, encircling the shed in which Chance’s uncle brews illegal whiskey. A motorcyclist takes off his helmet, revealing the long hair and fine features of a young woman. She’s Billy Burton’s daughter, raised ‘as a tomboy’ to do stunts from an early age. ‘I did one dangerous thing on this film,’ she recalls. ‘I had to jump off a bridge with another stuntman into the back of a moving train. To time the jump and make sure we were both going at the same time, we dropped lemons, which fall at the speed of your body.’

Woo talks of martial arts director Zhang Cheh. This is not a subject on which Woo dwells easily, but in 1986 he had said in an interview for the Hong Kong Film Festival catalogue that the man had influenced him ‘not so much in his way of portraying violence but his unrestrained way of writing emotions and chivalry. Chinese cinema has always been too low-key. We should be more expressive, put more of ourselves into our films.’

The quote is revealing. The expressionist qualities the west so admires in Woo’s films, far from being a given in his culture, are something he has had to fight to introduce. Hence, perhaps, his solitude, his feelings of ‘un-Chineseness’. Woo himself is reserved, gentle, almost shy, a man who likes to keep his mystery, his privacy. But shouldn’t one expect such paradoxes from someone who may be the best action director in the world, yet confesses he’s never fired a gun in his life, or, even better, that he doesn’t know how to drive?

**John Woo on ‘Hard Target’**  
I think I will stay in the United States. I know I can work here and make better movies than in Hong Kong. In some ways. I’m not very Chinese. My techniques, my themes, my film language are not traditionally Chinese.

_Hard Target_ is my first American film. It’s my chance to gain experience in a totally foreign environment. I need the film to establish myself commercially in Hollywood. But in the future. I’ll be writing my own scripts. And people like Quentin Tarantino, who knows my films very well, are writing scripts for me.

The methods of the American crew are not so different from those in Hong Kong, but they are more professional. In Hong Kong the technicians work very hard, we’ve known each other for a very long time and they really understand what I want, but they were not trained by experience, by going to film school.

I had shot in synch sound only once before, for the Cantonese opera film. It is not difficult at all, because I know this technique very well. In Hong Kong I routinely used several cameras. I shot in the American way. The most difficult thing for me here is to learn how to handle the ‘studio politics’. It can be very frustrating at times.
