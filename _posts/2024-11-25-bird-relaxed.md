Andrea Arnold (_Fish Tank_, _American Honey_) focuses on life in working-class England, where 12-year-old Bailey seeks to escape from her tumultuous life through a friendship with a mysterious stranger. Seamlessly moving between social and magical realism, _Bird_ is a tender fairytale of broken spirits searching for one another in a baffling and hostile world.

The post screening discussion will be hosted by Lillian Crawford of Stims Collective.
