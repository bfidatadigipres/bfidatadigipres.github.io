When he released _Oldboy_ in 2003, Park Chan-wook was a mainstream filmmaker in his native South Korea, having broken box-office records with his 2000 political thriller _Joint Security Area_. To international cineastes, he was more of an emerging name, notable alongside Takashi Miike, Hideo Nakata and Kim Ki-duk as a proponent of fashionably ‘extreme’ East Asian cinema. This dual reputation – popular at home, esoteric abroad – reflects the cultural microclimate of South Korea, where domestic product is not inevitably trounced by American juggernauts. But it also accounts in part for the particular type of cinema that _Oldboy_ exemplifies and that Park has continued to make: work of scale, spectacle and glamour, which is nonetheless not blunted or neutered for international acceptability.

That is not to say that _Oldboy_ – Park’s fifth film, and the title that firmly established him as an internationally significant auteur – is pure of outside influence. Its story, of a man who is incarcerated by a mysterious adversary and trawls his own past for an explanation, originates in a Japanese manga of 1996 by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi. Its themes of erotic obsession, manipulation and complicity, meanwhile, channel Park’s oft-cited favourite, Hitchcock’s _Vertigo_ (1958). _Se7en_ (1995) and _Memento_ (2000), the breakout films of his fellow Hitchcockians Christopher Nolan and David Fincher, are also in its DNA.

Its flashes back and forth in time, its visual dynamism, its unabashed embrace of the fantastical and its morbid sense of humour all glance back at Hollywood’s favourite 1990s son Quentin Tarantino (who presided over the 2004 Cannes jury that gave _Oldboy_ the Grand Prize), and forward at the variably ‘dark’ comic book adaptations that would very soon proliferate enough to claim multiplexes for their own. But _Oldboy_’s strangeness and sincerity are its own – and are embodied in a performance by Choi Min-sik that absolutely astonishes with its range and bravado. A 2013 remake by Spike Lee gave Josh Brolin the role, but failed to eclipse Park’s original in receipts or reputation.

_Oldboy_ triumphed, and endures, by turning preoccupations of the time – the growing ubiquity of surveillance; the unseen impacts of our casually taken pleasures upon other lives; our frightening uniqueness and no less frightening anonymity – into art that is at once shocking, heartfelt, and intensely funny. Its famous single-shot corridor fight sequence, in which our long-incarcerated hero – antihero? semi-hero? – sees off dozens of adversaries, provides a triumphant metaphor for Park’s ability to fight on all artistic fronts at once.  
**Hannah McGill, _Sight and Sound_, July 2024**

Kidnapped, locked up for 15 years and then released for no apparent reason, businessman Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) goes on the rampage, eating live octopus straight from the sushi bar, extracting vengeance from the jaws of his jailer with a claw hammer and cutting out his own tongue with a pair of scissors. With Quentin Tarantino presiding over the jury at Cannes, it’s easy to see how South Korean revenge fest _Oldboy_ scooped the [2004] Grand Jury prize.

But to focus solely on the film’s violence or sick and twisted plot is to sell it short, because _Oldboy_ also features virtuoso direction and editing, mesmerising performances and a relentlessly creative exploration of the revenge motif its director Park Chan-wook terms ‘the most dramatic subject in the world’. No wonder Cannes jury member Tilda Swinton warned Park that Tarantino would ‘steal a lot’ from the film.

Half Greek tragedy, half existential thriller, _Oldboy_ skips and slices between horror and action, thriller and absurdist comedy as its shock-haired everyman plays cat-and-mouse with an enigmatic persecutor. As in _Kill Bill_, the tone balances on a knife-edge between danger and dark comedy, though unlike that film _Oldboy_ poses as many philosophical questions as it severs limbs. ‘When my vengeance is over, can I return to the old Dae-Su?’ asks our hammer-happy hero, expressing just one of the many metaphysical dilemmas philosophy graduate Park crams into his high-concept screenplay.

South Korea is one of the few places in the world where homegrown films outsell Hollywood product, the country’s current creative and commercial boom following the end of military dictatorship – and censorship – in 1992. Park’s career began in the same year, though it wasn’t until 2000 that he made the thriller _Joint Security Area_, the nation’s most successful film ever, set against the escalating tension between North and South Korea. A disaster at the box office, Park’s next film _Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance_ (2002) also touched on political themes – such as the country’s economic crash.

The second instalment of this revenge trilogy, _Oldboy_ is very different in both its style and the way it treats its subject. If the hardboiled and minimalist _Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance_ described the ultimate destructiveness of revenge, _Oldboy_, says Park, ‘explores the positive side that brings people catharsis’. Here the lush score, rich art direction and flashy cinematic techniques describe a much more abstract story: the surreal guessing game between the bestial Oh Dae-Su and his omnipotent kidnapper Lee Woo-Jin (Yoo Ji-tae). Still, even without the overt politics of Park’s previous work it’s tempting to see _Oldboy_ as representing the return of the repressed on a national as well as a universal level: an acting out of violent fantasies that was impossible under the old regime.

Much of the new cinema coming out of South Korea seems to have _Oldboy_’s unsettling mix of graphic violence and absurdist humour. But ask Park Chan-wook why he thinks there are so many hyperviolent films made in South Korea, and he replies: ‘I think it’s down to what western distributors choose to show the west.’
