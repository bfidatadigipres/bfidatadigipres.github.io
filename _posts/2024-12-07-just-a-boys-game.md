There can be no better justification for the _modus operandi_ of the BBC drama department of the 1960s and 70s than the discovery of Peter McDougall. The most original Scottish voice of the era, McDougall might never have been given a break at any other time in broadcasting history.

Having gone straight from school to the Glasgow shipyards, McDougall fled to London in the mid-60s. It was while painting the house of _Z Cars_ star and future writer Colin Welland that he began relating his youthful exploits as a drum major in Glasgow’s Orange Parades. The fascinated Welland suggested McDougall turn his experiences into a television play.

Director John Mackenzie was flabbergasted at McDougall’s raw talent, and claims the finished film barely contained a single change from the original draft of the script. However, the Glasgow police blocked filming on a drama they feared would cause ‘bloodshed on the streets in the making and in the showing.’

Not disheartened, McDougall offered the BBC another play. _Just Your Luck_ (1972) told the story of a Protestant teenager who falls pregnant by a Catholic sailor. Its exposure of the religious bigotry of Scotland’s West coast caused an enormous reaction, from outrage in the locality to reviews hailing it as ‘the most exciting debut since _Look Back in Anger_.’

This success prompted the BBC to weather the inevitable controversy and finally make _Just Another Saturday_. The resultant film tells of one day in the life of 16 year-old John (Jon Morrison), whose excitement at leading the Orange Parade is shattered by his discovery of the violence behind the pageantry. Beyond the political issues, it is McDougall’s mastery not only of the gallows humour of Glasgow’s working class but of the hidden motives of parental kindness that make the drama, in Jeremy Isaacs’s words, ‘a masterpiece’ and won the play the Prix Italia.

_The Elephants Graveyard_ (1976) was an intimate, pastoral follow-up, teaming Morrison with Billy Connolly for the charming story of two unemployed men dodging the wives who they have deceived about their job situation. The play follows them over one gloriously irresponsible day as they revert to childhood through games, stories and examination of their fears and hopes.

The astounding _Just a Boys’ Game_ (1979) was another ‘play in a day’, pursuing hard man Jake McQuillen, whose life of alcohol, violence and emotional impotence is threatened by the arrival of a younger, razor-wielding thug. Featuring some of the strongest violence the BBC had ever dared broadcast, it was stunningly photographed by Elmer Cossey and featured McDougall’s most crackling dialogue and richest characterisations, all brilliantly evoked by a cast headed by blues singer Frankie Miller in a performance that melts the camera in its intensity.

The partnership of McDougall and Mackenzie was one of the finest of the era. Their final collaboration was on HandMade Films’ _A Sense of Freedom_ (1981), dramatising the life of notorious Glasgow criminal Jimmy Boyle. Despite a devastating portrayal of Boyle by David Hayman and some nightmarish sequences of depravity and brutality, it suggested that McDougall was less confident in fact-based or big screen works, an unfortunate weakness as TV drama lost its taste for the single ‘play’.

**The Insurance Man**  
Given that Alan Bennett’s screenplay for _A Private Function_ (d. Malcolm Mowbray, 1984) turned postwar rationing into full-blown Kafkaesque paranoia, it comes as little surprise that he would turn to the novelist himself as a subject. In fact, he did so twice: his play _Kafka’s Dick_ (a rather more overtly comic portrait) was also staged in 1986.

It’s not so much Franz Kafka who is the subject of _The Insurance Man_ as what he created – poor Franz (no relation) is caught up in a web of bureaucratic complexity that readers of _The Trial_ will recognise immediately as he tries not just to get compensation for an industrial injury but also to establish whether he’s even entitled to it.

Journeying through seemingly endless corridors, up and down straight and spiral staircases, passed from one unnamed functionary to the next, Franz (Robert Hines) encounters fellow victims at every stage, from the eternally optimistic Lily (Vivian Pickles), convinced that the door she’s patiently waiting beside holds the answer (it opens into a stairwell) to the embittered tribunal doctor (Geoffrey Palmer), whose grimly funny speech about the virtues of pessimism clearly mirrors his own personal journey from idealist to cynic.

This is the least-known of the three performances with which Daniel Day-Lewis made a spectacular splash in 1986 – _My Beautiful Laundrette_ (d. Stephen Frears) and _A Room with a View_ (d. James Ivory) were the others – but his star quality is evident even in a minor part: his Kafka isn’t on screen for long, but he holds it effortlessly, seen to best effect when his calm stillness beautifully counterpoints the blustering Gutling (Jim Broadbent).

Kafka’s problem is that he is more sensitive than his colleagues to his clients’ problems – which makes it worse if he does nothing about it. Out of guilt, Kafka arranges for Franz to take a job in his brother-in-law’s new factory, which solves the short-term problem but, in a perfect example of Kafkaesque irony, creates a long-term one as it’s producing asbestos (the dangers of which weren’t known at the time).

Richard Eyre had been directing television since the 1970s, but his reputation primarily came from his work at the National Theatre, and _The Insurance Man_ is ‘theatrical’ in the best sense, using the full panoply of Expressionist techniques in lighting and design to create an off-kilter world that perfectly matches Bennett’s edgy, paranoid script.
