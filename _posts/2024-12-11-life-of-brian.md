_+ intro by Justin Johnson, BFI Lead Programmer (Wednesday 11 December)_

According to legend, the idea for _Life of Brian_ stemmed from a throw-away remark by Eric Idle during an interview shortly after the release of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ (d. Terry Jones/Terry Gilliam, 1974). Asked what was next for the Pythons, Idle apparently replied _Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory_. The absurdity of a Monty Python biblical epic appealed to the rest of the team, and they set to work on what would be their most successful – and controversial – film.

While _Holy Grail_ was hindered by budgetary limitations and an episodic, hit-and-miss script, _Life of Brian_ benefits from a more robust narrative that still allows for moments of typical Python lunacy – like the bizarre and unexplained space battle – without detracting from the film’s flow. Furthermore, the financial backing of ex-Beatle George Harrison permitted a North African location shoot which, coupled with Peter Biziou’s photography and Jones’s direction, gives Life of Brian a genuinely epic look.

Typically, despite the ancient Jerusalem setting, the Pythons draw upon the British class system for much of the film’s humour. Pontius Pilate and his privileged Roman friends are portrayed as effete aristocrats, and the Jewish official presiding over the stoning is an archetypal petty bureaucrat. The resistance organisation the People’s Front of Judea – bitter rival of the Judean People’s Front – is a thinly-veiled parody of ineffectual far-left politics, riven by internal feuds.

The Pythons never intended the film to be a satire of the gospels, but a critique of the fractious nature of organised religion. Nevertheless, it caused outrage amongst religious groups, and created a wave of lobbying and boycotts which successfully persuaded a few local councils to ban the film. Of the 101 local authorities that insisted on viewing _Life of Brian_ before granting a license, 68 upheld the British Board of Film Censors’ AA certificate, 28 enforced a local X rating and 11 banned it from exhibition in their jurisdiction.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) the moral outrage, _Life of Brian_ was a box-office success, and Handmade Films – the production company set up by George Harrison to finance the film – became one of the British cinema’s major players during the 1980s and ’90s, responsible for a string of acclaimed films including _The Long Good Friday_ (d. John Mackenzie, 1979), _Time Bandits_ (d. Terry Gilliam, 1981) and _Withnail & I_ (d. Bruce Robinson, 1986).

Having agreed that sharing the directorial chores with Terry Gilliam on _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ had proved overly problematic, Terry Jones took sole control of a follow-up that Eric Idle had pitched with the title _Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory_. Shooting in Monastir, Tunisia on sets left by Franco Zeffirelli’s _Jesus of Nazareth_ (1977), Jones limited his on-screen presence to focus on his direction. Nevertheless, he still landed the standout line as Brian Cohen’s mother, Mandy: ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s a very naughty boy!’ Proudly declaring the film heretical, Jones defended it against accusations of blasphemy when it incurred a furious Christian backlash.

**A contemporary review**  
The Monty Python team, back in co-creative force after Terry Gilliam’s pretty but rather unfunny _Jabberwocky_, seem to have learned a lesson from their last feature, _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. They have at last abandoned their obsession with the fragmented absurdities, alienation gags and endless caption-and-credit jokes which inspired their TV half-hours but which merely disrupt the pace of a ninety-minute film.

_Life of Brian_ adopts a refreshingly coherent plot structure, still highly inventive but with the fun used in such a way as to advance rather than delay the story. Thus, the scene in which a pedantic Roman centurion corrects the grammar in Brian’s Latin graffito (‘Romans Go Home’ is the translation), and makes him write it out a hundred times, is not only superbly funny but also serves to convert Brian to political activism and puts him on the road to martyrdom. Even the one truly Python-esque moment – when Brian is fortuitously rescued from pursuing Roman soldiers by a passing starship driven by Muppet monsters in the midst of a frantic space war – somehow slots smoothly into the action and indeed launches the film into its cumulatively hilarious second half.

From this point, notwithstanding a script which is occasionally over-raucous and crude, the satire becomes sharp and relevant as Brian is set up as a reluctant messianic guru (‘Fuck off!’ he shouts at his awestruck followers; ‘Tell us, Lord, how shall we fuck off?’ they reply in unison), and the dogma-bound Judean People’s Front abandon him to crucifixion for the good of the cause. The climactic scenes are as memorable as anything yet devised by the Python mind – palace guards reduced to helpless giggles by Pilate’s references to his friend Biggus Dickus; the splinter group, the People’s Front of Judea, arriving to rescue Brian but then committing mass suicide at the foot of his cross – and culminate in a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy, as Eric Idle leads Brian and his fellow victims in ‘Always look on the bright side of life’.

The film might also be taken seriously as an attempt to demystify Christ and religious fanaticism, while it successfully sends up the kind of reverent, choir-laden, star-studded gospel dramatisations habitually perpetrated by the cinema industry on behalf of God and Mammon.
