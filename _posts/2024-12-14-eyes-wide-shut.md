**Jan Harlan (executive producer):** Stanley’s idea was to show a modern hell, a very abstract concept, a hell into which people enter out of boredom – money and wealth won’t do it any longer. Did he succeed? In Mediterranean countries and in Japan, yes, if one can generalise – in the UK and the USA, no. Arthur Schnitzler’s source novel had nuns, shocking in the 1920s, now obsolete; Stanley just upgraded this. I flew to Venice and bought the masks, all different – I know every mask shop and studio, as I was guided by a local lady. It was not too hard to solve this last-minute problem. Originally the voyeurs had half-masks, more in keeping with Vienna, but this would not work as a total disguise. The Indian Palace, the strange music, the masked girls, all this to make the scene as unreal as possible.

**Katharina Kubrick:** I think a lot of people, especially in America and England, were expecting something more salacious, and not the serious film that it turned out to be. When you hold a mirror to society, frequently society rebels and says, ‘No, that can’t possibly be the way we behave.’ The film did well in Japan and I know that Warner Brothers had people standing outside cinemas there, and couples were coming out of the movie hand in hand. But think about the conversations those couples were going to have after seeing this film…

I don’t think it’s a film for younger people. I think you have to have lived a bit and know what it’s like to feel jealous and upset and have fantasies. That’s why it also took him forever to make it. It was one of the first contracts he made with Warner Brothers in 1970 and then he sat on it. He and my mother said, ‘We really need to live a bit longer and have more life experience before we deal with this enormous subject.’ In the end he was very proud of it. He said he thought it was his greatest film.

**Anthony Frewin (Kubrick’s assistant):** Stanley once said he did not want to point out the ‘blindingly obvious’ but it needed to be stated anyway – that there is no correct interpretation of any creative work, that you only get out of it what you bring to it. And, as we know, his films have never lacked interpretations, but there’s one recent one I think would have appealed to him: the Freudian critic Mary Wild’s suggestion that the naval officer is in fact the navel officer. Perhaps he was aware of this but kept it to himself. Very puckish. Very Stanley.

**Frederic Raphael (co-writer):** ‘_Je ne cherche pas, je trouve_’ was Picasso’s retort to a pious inquiry about how he looked for ideas. His use of a set of handlebars to confect a metal goat was a typical example of literal recycling. Henry Moore was inspired by weathered rocks; Tracey Emin by weathered beds. The litter of earlier material disposed Stanley Kubrick, as it did ancient Greek tragedians, to select his subjects from existing sources; _Barry Lyndon_ (1975) – from an 1844 novel by William Thackeray – the least likely, most faithful instance. ‘Make it new’ depends on there being something old.

_Eyes Wide Shut_ is a translation in both time and place: Arthur Schnitzler’s Vienna of the 1880s in his source novel _Dream Story_ (_Traumnovelle_) became ‘today’s’ New York, constructed at Pinewood. What passed for ‘now’ included ‘then’: the New York City of Stanley’s adolescence. Woody Allen mocked the lavishness of what was supposed to be a young doctor’s Central Park West home, but the dreamy aspect of Schnitzler’s novel sanctioned subjective distortion. The title _Eyes Wide Shut_ was devised, in a blink, by Stanley, after I had proposed ‘Woman Unknown’. While Stanley incited me to re/present a Viennese marriage in modern dress and dialogue, he reverted, with pious regularity, to what he called ‘Arthur’s beats’: the movie should honour Schnitzler’s dreamy source. This included, so Stanley insisted for a long time, the ending in which the story’s sleep-walking antihero finds himself awake and back in the conjugal bed.

During more than two years of collaboration, Stanley and I met, always at his barbed-wire fenced compound near St Alban’s, only three or four times, for lunch. No one else was ever present. We never sat down to discuss problems on the script. Our practical conversations, often of an hour or two, were on the phone. After Stanley had studied the pages I had faxed, he would say that he liked this or, as time went on and he became more anxious, did not like that. Legend promises that, in the 1960s, he had toyed with making an art version of a blue movie with Terry Southern, when they were working on _Dr. Strangelove_ (1963). The closer he came to shooting _Eyes Wide Shut_, the more anxious he became about how to double the outrageous with the permissible. He scanned whorehouse brochures on Japanese TV in the hope of happening on clues.

Schnitzler’s ‘beats’ did not embrace any account of who organised the orgy. The episode concluded with a manifestly dreamy escape in a horse-drawn cab. I reminded Stanley that the enigmatic ending of Michelangelo Antonioni’s _Blowup_ (1966) had not given short measure a good name. Eventually, Stanley asked for some plausible background for what the orgy’s master of ceremonies, a millionaire whom I called Ziegler (played by Sydney Pollack), regularly organised. One critic has insisted Ziegler’s name was culled from some 14th-century Hasidic rabbi. In fact, I nabbed it from a garrulous agent who represented me in 1969.

In response to Stanley’s request, I typed out several pages of what purported to be an undercover FBI agent’s dossier on Ziegler and his friends. Their sexual extravaganzas were alleged to have been staged in honour of J.F.K. I faxed my pages to Stanley and was almost instantly called back, in a voice I had never heard before. He wanted me to tell him right away where I got ‘this stuff’. I said, ‘From between my ears.’ He said, ‘Freddie, don’t fool around with me. This is confidential material. Where did you get hold of it?’ ‘Stanley,’ I said, ‘I’m a writer. I make things up.’ Even provocateurs can dread the knock on the door.

Eventually I convinced Stanley that there should be a final scene with Ziegler which would explain some of the things that had happened in the ‘dream’. He turned down an early version, although he liked it, because ‘It needs Bogart and Greenstreet and unfortunately I can’t get them, so… would you do it again?’ He used to ask the same thing of his actors. He did not know what he was looking for, but – like Picasso – he recognised it when he came across it. How come _Eyes Wide Shut_ seems, as the cant says, ‘more relevant’ after 20 years? Images sometimes gather significance. Freud was another great admirer of ‘Arthur’; dreams were Sigmund’s _objets trouvés_.
