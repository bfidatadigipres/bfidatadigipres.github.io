‘People have always trusted me with their secrets. But who do I trust with mine?’ (Barbara Covett, _Notes on a Scandal_)

Two women caught up in a drama of need and betrayal are at the heart of this psychological thriller, _Notes on a Scandal_. The twists and turns of the story are noted in the acerbic diary of Barbara Covett (Dame Judi Dench), a domineering and solitary teacher who rules with an iron fist over her classroom at a decaying state-run secondary school in London. Save for her cat, Portia, Barbara lives alone, without friends or confidantes – but her world changes when she meets the school’s new art teacher, Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett).

Sheba appears to be the kindred spirit and loyal friend Barbara has always been seeking. But when she discovers that Sheba is having an incendiary affair with one of her young students (Andrew Simpson), their budding relationship takes an ominous turn. Now, as Barbara threatens to expose Sheba’s terrible secret to both her husband (Bill Nighy) and the world, Barbara’s own secrets and dark obsessions come tumbling to the fore, exposing the deceptions at the core of each of the women’s lives.

In this age of loneliness, isolation and disconnect, we live in cities that house millions of people yet everyone at one time or another yearns for companionship, for someone to reach out and connect with us on some level… any level. This is the universal feeling that comes through in Zoë Heller’s 2001 page-turner of a novel, _What Was She Thinking: Notes on a Scandal_, a suspenseful story of loneliness and obsession that cuts, with equal parts dark humour and realism, right to the shadowy centre of the human yearning for connection. Readers were drawn in by Barbara Covett’s blisteringly funny, yet ultimately deceptive, revelations about her so-called friendship with fellow teacher, Sheba Hart.

Between Sheba’s dangerously ill-conceived affair with a student and Barbara’s own ‘spin’ and hidden agenda, what might have been merely a character study unfolded more like a thriller. Eventually, the book would garner not only widespread acclaim but numerous awards, including being short-listed for the coveted Man Booker Prize for English literature. The rights were quickly acquired by leading producers Scott Rudin and Robert Fox. Rudin had already contracted with leading playwright and screenwriter Patrick Marber to tackle the adaptation.

When Richard Eyre was approached by Rudin and Fox about directing the film version of _Notes on a Scandal_ he, like so many others, had already read the book. Eyre had found it at once funny, touching and beautifully observed – precisely the kind of material that intrigues him. Eyre and Rudin had previously collaborated with great success, along with Judi Dench, on the acclaimed _Iris_, the film about the extraordinary life-long love affair between the brilliant author Iris Murdoch and her devoted husband, John Bayley as well as the critically lauded stage production _Amy’s View_. Eyre next directed the critically praised _Stage Beauty_, a comedy-drama set on the 17th Century London stage, but had since returned to the theatre, directing two highly successful and utterly opposite productions: the new musical stage version of _Mary Poppins_ in London and on Broadway, and his fresh adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic drama _Hedda Gabler_ in London’s West End.

Marber’s adaptation would be challenging, as Heller’s novel was written as a series of highly subjective journal entries in the pen of Barbara Covett which he masterfully crafted as diary entries, slowly revealing through her unreliable words the depths of her delusions and manipulations when it came to Sheba Hart. But based on Marber’s previous body of work, there was no doubt that he was up to the task. He recently came to the fore as the author of the play _Closer_, a darkly funny look into the realities of love and desire.

Marber had to come up with a way to turn Zoë Heller’s distinctly literary approach to the story of Barbara and Sheba into something far more dynamic, immediate and cinematic. Marber carved the story around the book’s most relevant and pressing theme: the overwhelming isolation that wreaks so much havoc in modern lives, which is the ultimate undoing of Barbara Covett.

Marber began by exploring the story’s two main characters, starting with Barbara, the unforgettable narrator who comes to harbour corrosive secrets about her new ‘best friend,’ Sheba Hart. Marber felt a similarly invigorating conflict towards the character of Sheba. ‘I gave Sheba a slightly more offbeat, bohemian background than she has in the book, but her vulnerabilities and complicated feelings remain the same,’ he comments.

Upon reading the completed screenplay, Richard Eyre was impressed with Marber’s skill at shifting the story from the subtlety of the page to the grander scale of the big screen, turning Barbara’s journal entries into palpably realistic scenes. Also important to Eyre was the screenplay’s honest handling of the highly topical but definitely controversial notion of a middle-aged, married teacher carrying on a torrid affair with her underage student. Ultimately, Eyre was most pleased by how the screenplay seemed to capture the irresistible speed and fearless verve of Heller’s novel, while retaining its rich emotions of laughter, horror and grief – which he knew would be heightened further via the film’s visual style and performances.

‘I really hope people find this film funny, as well as occasionally frightening, shocking and sad,’ Eyre says. ‘There is something at once comical, ghastly and terribly human about this delusion that Barbara has that she will have a passionate, lifelong friendship with Sheba. And Barbara’s feelings for Sheba are analogous to Sheba’s feelings for Steven, the schoolboy. These two women are not in control – any more than any of us are in control when it comes to love.’
