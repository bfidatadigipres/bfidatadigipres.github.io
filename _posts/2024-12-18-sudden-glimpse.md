Scottish artist Wilhelmina Barns-Graham – voiced here by Tilda Swinton – had an extraordinary creative passion. In his poetic documentary portrait, Mark Cousins explores her artistic practice, revealing how her synesthesia was central to it. With its intense focus on her work, exploring its variety of forms – from painting and drawing to print making – the film emphasises the singular prism through which Barns-Graham viewed the world. The film’s score, by Linda Buckley, provides a perfect response to the tonal qualities of this unique artist’s work.

There will be a post screening discussion exploring neurodivergent creativity, hosted by Benjamin Brown and Sam Chown Ahern of Neurocultures Collective.
