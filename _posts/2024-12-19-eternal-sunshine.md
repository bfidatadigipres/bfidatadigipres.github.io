‘Kaufman’s script showcases a perfect balance between intelligent and resourceful storytelling.’ – Carolina, BFI Member

We celebrate the 20th anniversary of director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman’s genre-bending classic. Upturning rom-com conventions with its sci-fi twist, the film finds heartbroken Joel deciding on a procedure that removes all memories of Clementine, his ex, only to change his mind at the last minute. But is he too late? It’s not strictly a ‘Christmas classic’, but with its wintery warmth and ultimately moving denouement, it’s a surprisingly perfect fit for the season of goodwill.  
**bfi.org.uk**  

The second collaboration between director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman – following the uneven _Human Nature_ – _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ mixes their respective thematic concerns with dazzling alchemy: it’s a film that is as bold and inventive as Kaufman’s past work, but is also, perhaps less predictably, remarkably sweet. Say what you will about previous Kaufman efforts _Being John Malkovich_, _Adaptation._ and _Confessions of a Dangerous Mind_, none of them exhibits the sensitivity and romantic longing that envelops _Eternal Sunshine_ like a soft blanket on a chilly night (when much of the film – given a wonderfully wintry feel by Ellen Kura – is set).

With the exception of a haunting pre-credit sequence, in which two bereft-looking New Yorkers, Joel and Clementine, meet on a deserted beach and spark up an instant attraction, the film is structured on two levels. Having established that Joel and Clem already dated, then split up, Kaufman’s script sees Joel consent to have his memories of her wiped; as the procedure begins – as determinedly low-tech as the portal in _John Malkovich_ – Joel retreats into his memories of the relationship, told, _Betrayal_-style, in reverse chronology. It’s at this point, with these parallel narratives set in train, that Kaufman and Gondry settle into a fine harmony.

The inside-out brain-teaser quality of Kaufman’s work reaches a kind of apotheosis, as Joel, having decided to halt the erasing of Clementine from his memory, hides within the recesses of his mind. The premise is thematically ambitious (a rain-soaked interior suggests Tarkovsky, another filmmaker concerned with the poignant workings of memory) while at the same time giving rise to some inspired bits of comedy (Joel’s childhood memories are embarrassingly revisited). Gondry reuses many of the visual tricks from his music videos, but they are grounded here in emotions and storytelling (Joel’s memory of certain people disintegrates as the procedure takes hold, faces blurring into indistinguishable smudges). In the scenes inside Joel’s brain, Gondry deepens the interest in extended childhood that has been a strong feature of his work (such as the autobiographical _I’ve Been 12 Forever_) with the added element of Kaufman’s fixation on sexual formation.

When Joel and the Clementine of his memories are finally chased back to the beach house where they first met, they comment on their feelings about these intimate moments as they (re)occur. The scene is among the finest Kaufman has done, simultaneously both inside and outside of itself; there is an emotional rigour here which brings to mind the probing intellectualism of Bergman’s _Persona_ (1966), but also a rapturous warmth and sense of discovery and adventure. Not quite done, Kaufman and Gondry replay a number of scenes from the opening, the viewer now seeing not strangers but fated lovers. The cleansed Joel and Clementine find out about the faults and foibles that first drove them apart – and yet they still decide to give the relationship a shot. As an affirmation of the power and meaning of love sharing experiences, memories and risks – in its concluding moments _Eternal Sunshine_ achieves a touching and unexpected epiphany.

_You have quite a high-powered cast here. How did you work with the actors?_

Sometimes they weren’t complaining exactly, but mentioning that things could be more organised. Jim Carrey told me he’d never seen such a disorganised shoot. But I think I was in charge of the chaos. It’s good for actors to have a lot of things happening around them. For instance, we would decide at the last second, ‘It’s snowing, let’s do this scene now instead of the one we’re supposed to do,’ even though the actors didn’t know their lines. It helped keep them on their toes and surprise them, and let them surprise us.

_Your editor Valdís Óskarsdóttir has worked on several Dogme productions, and_ Eternal Sunshine _has something of a rough-edged Dogme look. Was that deliberate?_

I always try to ignore style when I start working, even when I’m making music videos. The work just has to be functional. If you think too much about the aesthetics then the result becomes like the type of architecture you find in Hollywood – all about decoration, patisserie.

In the case of _Eternal Sunshine_ the look wasn’t a choice; it was more a necessity. The story is set in New York, but initially the producers wanted me to shoot in Toronto so there’d be more money for special effects. I didn’t want that. On _Human Nature_ I had to pretend Los Angeles was Washington and it was very constricting. I wanted to go into this movie with more freedom, to let the actors explore and just capture them with the camera. So I convinced the producers to stay in New York, promising I could make it for less money. All the actors, including Jim, took 10 cent of their usual salary.

It was a good thing for the film, first because we had New York and second because the fact that we had less money made us use a smaller crew and simpler lighting. A lot of the effects were done in the camera, with very low-key techniques.

_The film is extremely dark in places. Do you think it will be perceived as a comedy?_

I don’t know. It’s good when you decide it’s maybe not a comedy because then you don’t have the pressure to get the laughs. You just go along with what you want to shoot and don’t have to time the next line to make sure it can be heard over the audience’s laughter.

_How is your work influenced by your background in music videos?_

A question I get all the time is, ‘What is the difference between doing a music video and a film?’ I don’t know what to say, except to ask, ‘Can’t you see for yourself?’ I’m still making music videos. There are a couple of songs in _Eternal Sunshine_ by a band called The Willowz and I just did a video for them and one for Steriogram, a new band from New Zealand.

_Would you be interested in working on a Hollywood blockbuster?_

I’d like to do a big-budget film. I’d try to do something personal, though for sure it would be more difficult. I loved _Back to the Future_ – when I was in Hollywood five or six years ago I went on the Universal Studios tour and did the _Back to the Future_ ride. Jim talked to me recently about a project; I don’t know what it is yet. He said to me, ‘You, with a big budget: danger!’ He saw the madness of the possibilities.
