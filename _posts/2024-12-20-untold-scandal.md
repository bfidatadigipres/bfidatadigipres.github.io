E J-yong transposes the epistolary novel _Dangerous Liaisons_ from pre-revolutionary France to the late 18th-century Joseon Dynasty. A manipulative noblewoman challenges her womanising cousin to seduce a virtuous young lady (2007 Cannes Film Festival Best Actress winer Jeon Do-yeon). Opulence, passion, intrigue, and a high stakes game of power and desire intertwine in this meticulously crafted, wittily written and impressively performed period drama.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
An initial voiceover warns us that the characters of this story are ‘immoral beyond belief’, which is immediately encouraging. _Les Liaisons dangereuses_, Choderlos de Laclos’ 1782 epistolary novel on which this film is based, gives us a fascinated distance from its compulsive-repulsive game-players – and semi-reluctant empathy. Because of this, perhaps, it has been repeatedly filmed. Stephen Frears and Milos Forman stayed in period, while Roger Vadim transposed the story to chic Paris and Roger Kumble to overprivileged Manhattan.

E J-yong remains in the late 18th century, but takes the story into courtly Korea, where the juxtaposition of shocking intimacy and heavily swaddled ceremony is quickly established. At the beginning of the film, a hushed backdoors shag is interrupted on the verge of climax as the fearsomely poised Lady Cho approaches, gazing over her heavily embroidered sleeves.

Lady Cho and her unscrupulous cousin Cho-won are the equivalents to Laclos’ Merteuil and Valmont. The action broadly follows the original’s two-pronged machinations – to deflower a coltish virgin, and to breach the defences of a renowned prude, here called Lady Sook. She has been chaste for so long that, Lady Cho scoffs, ‘she is virtually a brick wall now’. Cho sadly loses Merteuil’s proto-feminist self-assertion (even Sarah Michelle Gellar in _Cruel Intentions_ spat, ‘I’m the Marcia fucking Brady of the Upper East Side, and sometimes I want to kill myself’).

Nonetheless, Lee Mi-Sook gives a performance of thrilling poise, her hair carefully braided and skewered, eyebrows plucked into permanent disdain. The camera stares unflinchingly at the machinations, staying tight on faces – Cho and Cho-won make us complicit in their scheme by gazing into the lens when apparently addressing each other. As a direct gaze is considered impudent (especially between the sexes), the determinedly lowered eyes only stoke the tension. The slightest smile or tum of the head suggests a hapless unbending.

If the opening sequence wittily replicates the conventions of a western period drama, complete with staccato baroque harpsichord, J-yong puts a distinctive spin on the _mise en scène_. Most scenes involve hushed conversations in small chambers, amid an atmosphere of gleeful surveillance. When the ladies coo over innovations newly arrived from China, Lady Cho typically pounces on a telescope. Immaculate trays of food, cosmetics and calligraphy form chilly still-lifes that may recall Martin Scorsese’s interrogation of a rigid society in _The Age of Innocence_, though J-yong marbles the decorum with a seam of naked flesh and discreet sauce.

The film’s publicity trumpets its unprecedented costume budget. Hanbok, a traditional costume based on wrapping, is perfect for this story, with its layers to be unfolded and inviting ribbons. Throughout, colour slashes through dun greys, browns and muted blues. Lady Cho wears dazzling emerald and primrose, and duplicity provokes her most florid robes of orange and peony. Sook, however, is swathed in demure dove grey. A curved dagger secures her hair, but she’s helpless against Cho-won’s insinuating campaign. Eventually, publicly humiliated and stripped of dignity, she collapses in a slump of inky blue.

_Untold Scandal_ stages dazzling central sequences of double-meaning and hypocrisy. Lady Cho assures a horny youth that ‘men and women are like butterflies and flowers – it is natural and you need not be concerned with propriety,’ even though she speaks from behind a wall-length grille. Sook reads Cho-won’s ardent letter at a desk backed by a restrained screen of mountain views – he devours her reply while enjoying delicious little snacks and a blowjob.

‘What is the endgame here?’ asks Cho-won, as pique and reckless passion spur characters towards destruction. As in all the Laclos films, icy Sadean machinations are swept into a desolate romanticism. The closing scenes pick up on Cho’s pitiless demand for proof that her cousin has taken his promised maidenheads. Cho-won provides a cloth with a bloodied, dark stain, like a florid pressed flower. When he is subsequently stabbed in the back, a damp red stain spreads over his white robe, while a suicidal Sook walks on to the ice and disappears into a snowy white expanse, leaving only a scarlet swirl of silk behind. In _Untold Scandal_, colour is mocking, mournful destiny.
