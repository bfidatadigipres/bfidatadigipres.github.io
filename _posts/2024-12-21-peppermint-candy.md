A veritable emotional tsunami of a film, Lee Chang-dong’s epic second feature boldly tells a man’s life story starting with his suicide on a railway bridge, where he screams ‘I want to go back!’ as a speeding train approaches. The film then does just that, using reverse chronology to show what has brought Young-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) to this point. These episodes from key junctures in his life (1994, 1987, 1980 and 1979) also note the roots of many issues that have since spurred modern Korean cinema’s interrogation of the national psyche.

Young-ho’s actions are frequently unsympathetic, and Lee never seeks to excuse his unpleasantness towards others; he is brazenly hypocritical as a married businessman in the 1990s and irredeemably brutal as a police officer in the 1980s. Rather, this masterfully executed film explains the protagonist’s dehumanisation within the context of a tumultuous history that ultimately allows for a measure of compassion towards an irreparably broken individual.

The opening scene of Lee Chang-dong’s 1999 film, _Peppermint Candy_, begins with a picnic and ends with a suicide. A dishevelled, middle-aged _hwesawon_, or ‘company employee’, named Young-ho (played by Sol Kyung-gu) stumbles into a gathering of friends near a small river. The dozen or so happy picnickers, dancing and singing to a karaoke machine, seem at first not to notice the grey-suited, unkempt man, but they soon recognise him as an old friend from 20 years ago. Young-ho is offered _soju_, a Korean rice liquor, but he is not in a particularly celebratory mood. He volunteers to sing a song, but the sad melody the salary man belts out, with great anguish, only casts a sombre pall over the party. Silently returning the microphone, Young-ho wanders off into the shallow river toward a nearby railroad overpass.

While his friends resume their merriment, Young-ho somehow has managed to climb to the top of the bridge. He stands on the suspended tracks, looking grim and miserable. Soon a train rumbles toward him while repeatedly blowing its whistle. Tension builds with the nearing confrontation between Young-ho and the train, underscored by accelerated shot-reverse shots. A worried picnicker has left the party and stands beneath the tracks with a helpless look on his face. He frantically screams his suicidal friend’s name above the loudening rumble: ‘Kim Young-ho!’ As the heavy train comes treacherously close, Young-ho turns to face it. The film quickly cuts to a perspective from the train and he yells out, with outspread arms and a wide-open mouth, ‘I want to go back!’ The camera-train relentlessly rails toward Young-ho, until it stops on a close-up of his anguished face, signalling the moment of impact. Over the freeze frame, the clanging of the train continues on the soundtrack.

Lee’s film obeys Young-ho’s desire to go back by narrating the course of his life backward, depicting significant scenes from his personal history: Spring 1999, Summer 1994, Spring 1987, Fall 1984, May 1980, and Fall of 1979. These moments provide snapshots of one South Korean man’s life and allow the viewer to piece together how Young-ho’s misery in the present is connected to a series of regrettable decisions made in the past. Each episode is flanked by a short interlude. Repeating the camera angle that captured the image of Young-ho’s death, the interludes depict moving shots above railroad tracks, taken with a stationary camera placed on a moving train. The first two look as if they move forward on these tracks, but with the third, the spectator comes to realise that the camera is positioned on the last car of the train, and that the film itself is projected backwards. Cars and vans are shown driving in reverse, children run the wrong way, and smoke grows smaller and thickens rather than disappearing into the air. While these interludes pull the diegesis backwards in time, they unfold in accordance with the spectator’s inexorable, forward experience of the film. In lieu of a linear cause-effect relationship, Lee’s film proceeds by an effect-cause movement, reiterated in the reverse movement of the train. By its end, _Peppermint Candy_ will have spanned 20 years, taking the viewer back to the moment when Young-ho, singing songs with friends at a picnic near a small river in 1979, emerges into the sparkle of life and dreams about his future.

Travelling back in time, the film links moments from Young-ho’s personal history to key moments from South Korea’s democratisation process. As the spectator gradually comes to realise, the fictional world of _Peppermint Candy_ cannot be separated from the historical events to which it constantly refers. Young-ho’s third episode coincides with political uprisings that took place in early 1987, during the dictatorial presidency of Chun Doo-hwan. At this historical juncture, a 21-year-old student activist at Seoul National University, Park Jung-chul, was detained by authorities in January and died when he was tortured to disclose the names of fellow activists. His death inflamed the public and became the _cause célèbre_ for the June Democracy Movement that took place later that year. In Fall 1984, when Young-ho is depicted joining the KNPA (Korean National Police Agency) in Lee’s film, progressive groups became increasingly vocal in their demand for human rights and called for the end of Chun’s authoritarian regime. In this year, college campuses saw a sharp rise in student activism while the Council of People’s Democratisation Movement mobilised workers and peasants to become aware of their disenfranchisement. The primal scene, or the originating trauma, of Young-ho’s misery in _Peppermint Candy_, however, is inextricably linked to one of the most dramatic political events in modern Korean history: the Gwangju Uprising in May of 1980. What began as a student demonstration protesting the closing of Chonnam National University, located in the South Jeolla city of Gwangju, quickly escalated over a ten-day period. Chun swiftly implemented martial law in response to the demonstrations. In solidarity, tens of thousands of student activists, workers, and citizens of the city rallied against his dictatorship while Korean army soldiers and paratroopers were dispatched to the city. They began beating and shooting the political dissenters. To this day, the number of civilian casualties remains in contention.

Young-ho’s life may be read as a national allegory for these watershed historical events, as standing in for the South Korean nation in its struggle toward modern democracy. However, _Peppermint Candy_ does not focus on the victims of the state’s repressive power, but on Young-ho’s violent exercise of this power. He is called up as a member of the national military to put down protesting students and workers in Gwangju. When Young-ho joins the KNPA, he is quickly indoctrinated into their inhumane methods of extortion. His violence causes a radical sympathiser to lose control of his bowels on Young-ho’s hand during an aggressive interrogation session. He brutally extracts information from dissenting leftists by forcibly dunking their heads in water, techniques that were utilised to torture and presumably kill the progressive student, Park Jung-chul. In these events, Young-ho’s originating trauma is equated to the South Korea’s historical trauma that began in May of 1980: one act of violence is linked to the next, constituting a chain of brutality that links the progression of his life to the life of the nation. And with each repetition, Young-ho stubbornly disavows the possibility of reflecting and working through the past. His inability to mourn, as film scholar Kyung Hyun Kim suggests in his reading of Lee’s film, cannot be separated from his idyllic romanticisation of innocence, of a time before May 1980, and the impossible hope of rekindling innocence lost. Young-ho acts out, exercising sovereign power over the people he tortures as well as sovereignty over his past.
