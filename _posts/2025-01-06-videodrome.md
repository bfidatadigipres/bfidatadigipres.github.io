**A contemporary review**  
David Cronenberg’s audacious attempt at conflating medium and message produces more than just the time-honoured confusion of illusion and reality: it actually tests the audience’s receptiveness to TV’s ‘post-narrative’ properties of fragmentation and flow in an alien (theatrical) context. Accordingly, Renn’s ‘hallucinations’ are not presented as formal breaks in the film’s narrative structure, but as determinants of that structure. For a good part of _Videodrome_’s running time, Cronenberg actually risks a devilishly playful replication of the comparatively subjective video-viewing experience (grounded as it is in notions of personal programming, multiple channel choice, diversified attentiveness, and so on).

_Videodrome_ is no tetchy attack on TV as an institution, as per _Network_ – its tone is, if anything, more apocalyptic, while its quotient of black humour is significantly boosted – but a cheekily speculative fiction about that interactive space between the viewer and the screen which has exercised sociologically or psychologically oriented media theorists for years. The film inventively rephrases the question of whether the programming or the viewing psyche might best be construed as the true ‘video nasty’, and it wades (somewhat like _A Clockwork Orange_) into the screen sex-and-violence debate with the sort of inquisitive devil’s advocacy that might have both the libertarian and censorious forces peering warily over the rims of their respective trenches.

Cronenberg’s unique sci-horror movies have, of course, often themselves featured heavily in this very debate (as, it’s conceivable, might this one, for its calculatedly complex use of sado-erotic imagery), and in some senses _Videodrome_ offers a synthetic reprise of its director’s oeuvre to date. For a start, there’s the matter of Cronenberg having been dubbed ‘the King of Venereal Horror’ – a soubriquet earned mainly on the strength of _Shivers_ and it’s surely more than a chance irony that _Videodrome_ abbreviates so ‘naturally’ to VD. The video experience here is not only orgasmic, not only addictive or epidemic, but ‘it bites’. Then there’s the motif of the ‘absent theorist’, with the figure of the late Brian O’Blivion (one from the very heart and homeland of Marshall McLuhan) harking back to such early predecessors as Luther Stringfellow and Antoine Rouge in _Stereo_ and _Crimes of the Future_.

As in _The Brood_, there are the psychic states ‘made flesh’: here developed in line with the dominant sense of visual punning to include living-tissue ‘handguns’ and ‘hand grenades’ ­– and topped, inevitably, by an exhibition of Rick Baker’s magnificently gloppy special effects that’s beguiling in its essential arbitrariness. The clinching unity, though, is again Cronenberg’s reading (and re-writing) of Darwinism as a cautionary text, with both the human physique and psyche undergoing riskily rapid evolutionary change in adapting to radically new environments and cultural norms.

Eventually, perhaps, _Videodrome_ has more coherence as ‘A David Cronenberg Film’ than as an Awful Warning on the video future. The ambiguity that attends the narrative hints of a hypnotic conspiracy (a genuine conflict of ideological image-controllers or a mere reflection of Renn’s interior dualism?) keeps it a little too evasively shadowy to live up to O’Blivion’s scene-setting rhetoric: ‘The battle for the minds of North America will be fought in the Videodrome...’ While the fact that a strong stomach is such an essential prerequisite for anyone engaging with the film’s sophisticated wit does pose problems in terms of identifying the likely audience.

Pleasures do accompany the provocations, though: James Woods brings a suitably edgy quality to the first-person perspective, and Cronenberg once more conjures up a host of blandly sinister Toronto unknowns in effective support. Debbie Harry utilises her own poster-icon status to add resonance to her role as an S&M caricature (in one sequence _apparently_ echoing her character name of Nicki Brand with a taste for knife nicks on the shoulder and cigarette burns on the breast). But, operating exclusively as a function of Renn’s particular voyeurist impulses, she is eventually almost as constrained here as she was by her limiting roles in _The Foreigner_, _Union City_ and _Roadie_. None the less, however one receives the movie, it’s a certainty that Cronenberg’s customised line in living, breathing videocassettes will totally transform anyone’s innocent conception of ‘software’.
