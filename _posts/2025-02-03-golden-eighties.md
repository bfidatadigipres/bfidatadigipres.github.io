Shopping precincts are as good an indication as any of our moral condition. Just as the Passage Choiseul, where in the early years of the century Céline’s anti-hero watched his parents sinking deeper and deeper with every passing moment, identified the wellsprings of petit-bourgeois resentment, so now in the 1980s, from Las Vegas to Les Halles, the tinted marbles, the hothouse plants and the fountains create an environment that literally encapsulates the hedonism of a life lived permanently in a conservatory. These people are sheltered from the elements, maintained at the perfect temperature, insulated from the inconveniences of the outside world but with all the advantages and semblances of it (shops, cafes, cinemas, passers-by...). The shopping mall, today, is the nexus of postmodernism and consumerism.

To judge from its title _Golden Eighties_, Chantal Akerman’s film is an explicit comment on the malaise of our civilisation, a sidelong and witty look at our aspirations and moral values. After the years of lead come the years of gold-dust! These neatly shod female feet which populate the title sequence, briskly criss-crossing the strawberry-coloured slabs of stone, bent on crucial and important missions, these are the locomotive of the economy.

But _Golden Eighties_ has another economy too. It was Jacques Demy who first realised that the enclosed space of a gallery and its symmetrical design is the perfect foil for a musical, with the constraints of the setting justifying and shaping the choreography of the formation dancing and making the musical romanticism seem more fantastic in contrast. This is Akerman’s tribute to Demy, although it does not have the desperation that certainly underlay his last film _Une chambre en ville_. _Golden Eighties_ is jokey and fast-moving, with one of the liveliest scores, by Marc Herouet, and wittiest sets of lyrics, by Akerman (alas, not well subtitled), for many years.

But where is the happiness in these golden eighties? This is the sad tale of Mado, the hairdresser’s apprentice who loves Robert, son of the owners of the clothes shop opposite, although Robert only wants Lili, Mado’s sexy, flirtatious and untrustworthy boss who is Monsieur Jean’s mistress. So Robert should make a sacrifice and settle down to a life of effort and responsibility, just as his father Monsieur Schwartz had settled down with Jeanne. But at what cost? For Jeanne had loved an American GI called Eli who now, remarkably, comes strolling through the mall, recognises her after all these years and tries to persuade her to come away with him. This is a goldfish bowl in which every move the principals make is observed and maliciously commented on by the chorus of male layabouts and shampoo girls. A continuous, edifying spectacle that almost everyone dreams of leaving.

The point is, however, they construct their dreams the better to remain where they are. Rather like Marie-France Pisier in _Souvenirs d’en France_ (André Téchiné, 1975), Lili, terminally bored with Monsieur Jean’s attentions, takes off with the Eli whom Jeanne has just rejected, only to return two months later, ludicrously and heavily disguised in headscarf and dark glasses, just in time to seduce Robert and so sabotage his wedding. Sylvie, the girl who runs the bar, is thrilled with an escape that keeps her rooted to the spot, in the form of letters from her boyfriend who has gone to Canada to make his fortune. ‘He hates it there,’ she says. ‘So he’s coming back?’ they all ask. ‘Not yet,’ replies Sylvie with an angelic smile, and her world would clearly be shattered if he did. All the other characters construct scenarios as unreal as the mall itself, all except Lili are incurable romantics.

Yet even their romantic yearnings ring repetitiously. Monsieur Schwartz’s disquisition on the work ethic parrots the pages of _L’Expansion_, but bears absolutely no relation to reality or the people around him; Lili’s sentiments in regard to Monsieur Jean are radically inauthentic; both are typical of the world of the shopping mall: everyone is recycling snatches of sentiment and belief that they have taken off the peg in order to help them stay exactly where they are. Exogamy, it would seem, is virtually impossible, as is thought beyond this infernally constructed spiral.

It is the Schwartz couple who are the absent centre of _Golden Eighties_. Delphine Seyrig as the gracefully ageing Jeanne, whose radiant smile is half designed to sell clothes and half the result of her detachment, perfectly incarnates the mentality of caution and prudence, while Charles Denner as Schwartz, in his over-neat suit, his concern for _Lebensraum_, his designs on the floor space of Lili’s salon, has learned the lessons of modern commerce so well that he embodies its stresses, his grandiose ambitions contrasting markedly with his slightly pinched appearance and slightly nervous demeanour. Neither is capable of articulating clearly what they want. When Schwartz wants to talk he goes into the mall and paces up and down; when Jeanne wants to talk she goes into the cinema and unburdens her heart in front of a screen playing old, romantic movies. Indeed, when any of the couples in _Golden Eighties_ meet it has to be in a cubicle for they have no space outside the mall itself.

_Golden Eighties_ does not bear thinking about too closely, and indeed does not require it. The film is as frothy as the shampoo in the hairdresser’s, a film in a much more popular and accessible mode than some of Akerman’s earlier works, and a film which contrives to be witty and tender and sad, despite its devastatingly accurate observation of the way we live now. And if the musical genre is one which many audiences traditionally find difficult, this film should go a long way towards effecting a reconciliation.
