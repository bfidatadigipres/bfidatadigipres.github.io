**A contemporary review**  
_La_ _Captive_ is a film like no other currently on London’s screens, but if the director’s name, Chantal Akerman, puts you in mind of an avant-garde, confrontationally feminist cinema from the past, you’d be wrong this time. Similarly, if the fact that _La_ _Captive_ is another Proust adaptation made in the wake of Raul Ruiz’s magisterial _Le Temps retrouvé_ with the same producer, Paolo Branco, prompts you to expect more Visconti-like opulence and moving scenery, such preconceptions should be banished. _La_ _Captive_ does explore territory that once nourished many auteurs – the very borders between sexual obsession, dream logic and madness where Hitchcock and Buñuel plied their trade but it now seems Akerman’s alone.

All the autobiography and deconstruction we’ve come to expect of Akerman since her 1975 breakthrough feature _Jeanne_ _Dielmann_ _23_, _Quai_ _du_ _commerce_, _1080_ _Bruxelles_ are here subsumed to the cause of creating a truly cinematic world of allure, distraction and unknowing. And it may match a new mood in the director herself: ‘I forget how difficult I used to be. I see some people in the industry and I say hello and they ignore me because they still remember I was obnoxious 20 years ago.’

_La_ _Captive_ adapts the section of Marcel Proust’s _A la recherche du temps perdu_ titled _La_ _Prisonnière_, in which Proust’s well-born narrator Marcel describes his tortuous relationship with his live-in mistress Albertine. To himself Marcel professes his indifference to his mistress, but outwardly he behaves with extreme jealous possessiveness. The obsessive lover in Akerman’s film is Simon, a very rich young man of the present day. He not only uses a mutual female friend Andrée to spy on and chaperone his girlfriend Ariane, he himself follows Ariane like a stalker. His jealousy of Ariane’s female friends (some of whom are almost certainly her lovers) is more pronounced than in Proust. Simon wants to know not just ‘what goes on’ between women, but what they’re thinking, and the unattainability of his girlfriend’s mind is compounded only by the unattainability of the lesbian worldview.

_La_ _Captive_ opens with amateur film footage of the Normandy-beach frolics of Ariane, Andrée and several other women on holiday together, who all display a communal air of closed-off intimacy, a collective Gioconda smile. At one moment Ariane, a wiry, freckled presence, looks directly at the camera as if challenging the audience to discover who she is. Then we find out that the silent amateur film is being projected by Simon, and that he’s trying to lip-read what Ariane is saying as she stands next to Andrée. ‘I like you very much,’ is his conclusion. Cut to Ariane in a summer dress and high heels striding confidently through a near-deserted Place Vendòme in Paris. She’s being watched as she gets into her open-top Mercedes by Simon, in the driving seat of his Rolls. As we see her move off from Simon’s viewpoint and the Rolls follows behind, the shooting style reminds us irresistibly of police detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) tailing Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak – whose character is undoubtedly named with Proust in mind) through the streets of San Francisco in _Vertigo_, especially as the orchestral music swells: a doom-laden, watery piece by Rachmaninov, _The_ _Isle_ _of_ _the_ _Dead_, that’s highly reminiscent of Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann. Soon Simon is following Ariane at a distance as she climbs one of the steep stairways of Montmartre. The click-clack of her determined progress is in stark contrast with Simon’s entranced silence – he seems to glide with his arms fixed at his sides, like a Magritte figure floating through a De Chirico Paris. But when he reaches the hotel he’s seen Ariane enter and the receptionist tells him she’s booked a room for her aunt, not for herself, we’re thrown into another surrealist’s arms – those of Buñuel and his discreetly charming but bewildered bourgeoisie.

It would be all too easy to over-emphasise the myriad influences here, which amount to nothing more than a drinking in of cinema on Akerman’s part. What’s completely unique is _La_ _Captive_’s extraordinary sense of time. As Ariane explores an art museum under Simon’s gaze, the tension is excruciating. Ariane’s heels clomp on the wooden floorboards as she strides through the exhibits, seemingly in real time, while Simon’s slower steps only make the floor groan and creak. The elastic time frame of this ridiculous bout of hide-and-seek is typically dreamlike. It’s clear Ariane must know what Simon gets up to and it may be part of the game they play in which sex can occur only after he’s pretended to do something else and she’s fallen asleep. You could widen that out and suggest that his suspicions of her lesbianism are equally part of their rituals and that without them the obsession would disappear.

You can read it either way, especially as Akerman makes sure her film always puts us in Simon’s position. Though he’s a shit who behaves as if he owns Ariane – in one scene he even drags her away from an opera-house reception without the slightest nod towards social niceties – the women do all seem as if they’re lying to him. Andrée – his supposed confidante and Ariane’s chaperone – is also number-one suspect as Ariane’s lover (while Simon dry-humps her sleeping form, Ariane calls out Andrée’s name). These dualities all contribute to the feeling of a work of pure cinema, one that doesn’t give up its meanings in the first reel, or even at the first screening. In portraying the enigma of woman from a man’s point of view, Akerman successfully reveals the real enigma of the unknowability of any human being to another. And of course Simon, with his obsession and his pollen allergies (which seem analogous to post-coital disgust), is as much of a captive of his own imagination as Ariane.
