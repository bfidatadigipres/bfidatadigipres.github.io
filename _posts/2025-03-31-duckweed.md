Part of the _Eleven Women_ TV series, _Duckweed_ marked Edward Yang’s directorial debut following his return to Taiwan. Co-producers Sylvia Chang and Chen Chun-tian envisioned a platform for emerging talent, focusing on women’s stories and Taiwanese identity. This two-part episode follows Yue-hua, a young woman from the countryside, as she moves to Taipei to pursue a modelling career. Here Yang’s deft storytelling captures the clash between rural and urban life, hope and disillusionment.

**Edward Yang**  
Taiwanese New Wave pioneer Edward Yang has been overshadowed by his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien. But it was Yang who lit the New Wave bonfire to begin with, first as a rookie contributing the short _Desires_ to the omnibus project _In Our Time_ (1982), a film that became for Taiwanese culture the equivalent of _Bicycle Thieves_, _Days of Being Wild_ and _Where Is the Friend’s House?_ all rolled into one. Four simple tales of urban childhood and maturation, emerging into a serendipitous confluence of economic downturn and the easing of political strictures by the Kuomintang, the movie electrified both a moribund formula industry on the verge of being overwhelmed by Hong Kong crowd-pleasers and its audience, who had long given up hoping to see their lives represented on screen.

After that Yang made just seven features in 17 years, only two of which were released in the UK: _A Brighter Summer Day_ (1991) and _A One and a Two_ (_Yi Yi_, 2000). He came late to filmmaking after first receiving degrees in electrical engineering and computer design and pursuing a related career at the University of Washington in Seattle. Forever flirting with graduate film study, he joined a course at the University of Southern California but dropped out after only one term in frustration at the narrow focus on Hollywood cinema. He also frequented UW’s film programmes, becoming a Herzog and Antonioni devotee. Back in Taiwan in 1981, he landed a few jobs (including writing a script for the Hong Kong TV movie _The Winter of 1905_) and directed his quarter of _In Our Time_, thus solidifying with Hou, Chen Kun-hou, screenwriter Wu Nien-jen (also the star of _A One and a Two_), then-playwright Tsai Ming-liang and others Taiwanese cinema’s distinctive voice.

Yang was the urban maximalist to Hou’s country minimalist: his characteristic canvas is broad, multi-charactered, multi-generational and ruled by contrasting perspectives. His debut feature _That Day on the Beach_ (1983), the first film shot by Christopher Doyle, makes intricate use of flashbacks to examine the frustrated ambitions of a middle-class woman trapped in an unhappy marriage. _Taipei Story_ (1984) traces the disintegrating relationship between a successful career woman and her restless partner, who dreams of going to California. _The Terrorisers_ (1986) tracks the destabilised lives of three couples, while the four-hour _A Brighter Summer Day_ paints a heartbreaking portrait of social unease during the gang-plagued nascent nationalism of 1959. _A Confucian Confusion_ (1994) and _Mahjong_ (1996) mirror each other, dissecting new Taipei culture by way of opposing social tapestries: yuppies and petty scam artists. _A One and a Two_ hones in on one family’s middle years – when children seem nothing but trouble, ageing parents begin to die and lost opportunities haunt – but Yang’s empathetic volleying between points of view gives the film dizzying epic juice. Always concerned with the Taiwanese social now, Yang’s best work still throbs with the regrets and memories of history, displaying an understated eye and ear for the tearful poetry of a modem life which moves too fast for its wounds to heal.

This kind of ambitious, novelistic filmmaking couldn’t have been easy, and perhaps Yang’s aesthetic was changing: during the years of battling cancer he had been preparing an animated film with Jackie Chan titled _The Wind_. Just imagine.
