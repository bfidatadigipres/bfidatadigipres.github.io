Last year at Cannes, Lee Chang-dong held up a magnifying glass to Korean society and unveiled his critique on the one per cent vs the 99 per cent in _Burning_. Now it’s Bong Joon-ho’s turn. Of course have-nots have always been his heroes, whether they’re a snack-shop-dwelling family battling a giant amphibious mutant (in _The Host_) or a teenager and her grandfather raising a super pig in the mountains (_Okja_). _Parasite_ is possibly even more explicit and angry a socio-political critique than _Snowpiercer_, which saw its prole insurgents upsetting the rigid class ecosystem on a train in a futuristic ice age. But its scale is far smaller. Ever the sui generis genre-switcher, Bong this time has his class struggle play out in a con-family comedy. And it’s a riot.

Meet Ki-taek (Bong’s patron saint of slackers, Song Kang-ho) and his family: existing on the bottom rung of the gig economy, they are nothing but industrious, folding pizza boxes for peanuts, freeloading off any wifi signal they can while also trying to stop drunk passersby from urinating by their cramped basement home. ‘Wait,’ says father Ki-taek as they rush to close the window at the sight of fumigators advancing down the street. ‘Free extermination.’

When his son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) gets a gig posing as a university-educated English tutor for the teenage daughter of a fancy family, they hit the jackpot. Soon, in a fiendishly orchestrated caper, more and more of the clan join the rich family’s entourage. As always with Bong’s films, the devil is in the detail, of which no spoilers here, except to say that it’s a wicked ride. In this servant/master home-invasion potboiler, exactly who is leeching off whom is never clear.

All of this very naturally plays out as a satire of the whims and extravagances of the remote and cloistered wealthy. Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is a cordial businessman with an icy edge who expects his chauffeur’s smooth turns not to upset his coffee. Mrs Park (Cho Yo-jeong) is a helicopter mum, particularly indulgent of her pampered little son. Both sets of parents simply want the best for their offspring. But only the Parks can buy it.

Compared to the young Park children receiving extra tutoring, Ki-woo and his crafty sister Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) can’t afford further study. ‘I just printed out the document early,’ Ki-woo says of his forged degree certificate. That he still yearns to go to university is illustrative of the mindset of the entire utopia-seeking family, chasing dead-end dreams even as Bong makes it clear that prospects are far from rosy for graduates.

There’s a lot of talk of vigour. Two adages often trotted out in life and more trite movies are both skewered. First, that hard honest work will reap rewards. Second, that money can’t buy you happiness. Bong doesn’t show it as a direct ticket to bliss, but security and material comfort certainly have their advantages. ‘She’s rich but still nice,’ says Ki-taek of Mrs Park. ‘She’s nice because she’s rich,’ his wife Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) acutely replies as she shoves away one of the Parks’s small pooches.

The visual design of _Parasite_ delights in contrasts. The filthy basement strewn with clutter and rubbish is the opposite of the Parks’s lavish concrete-and-glass Modernist pad, pristine and minimalist right down to the delectable back-lit possessions on display. Who wouldn’t want to live this life, the film taunts.

As the home invasion progresses, the laughs darken until they’re downright squirmy. Increasingly sinister scenes usher in a shift in tone but don’t upturn the film, due to the realness of the characters and how Bong keeps burrowing further into their minds. Just when everything teeters on full-out deranged, he decides to hold up a mirror to Ki-taek’s family and show them just how they are seen by the Parks, and by implication, most of society.

Duped into playing the game of guessing which of the two families are the dirtiest rotten scoundrels, we only later realise that it’s capitalism that’s the true parasite. What’s quite unexpected, beyond the deliciously twisting finale, is the tender musing on familial love that emerges and the sorrowful all-too-late realisation that you can’t buy home.  
**Isabel Stevens, bfi.org.uk, 25 May 2019**  

Bong Joon-ho might have already been the most internationally beloved Korean New Waver, but _Parasite_, an acid-tongued satire in classic Bongian style, appears to be the one Bong movie that jazzes all the people all the time. It has gone through the roof. Maybe the closest we have today to a social-issue attack dog in the Sam Fuller mode, Bong is also a gripping mainstream storyteller, and his best films, of which _Parasite_ is one, depict the tense lines of force in Korean society in often uproarious ways that anyone anywhere can feel in their guts. Certainly, the extreme socio-economic portraits Bong has laid out here – grungy and resourceful low-rung scramblers versus brittle nouveau riche narcissists – represents a paradigmatic reality practically any Earth-dweller can recognise.

Having gone global already on a scale no other Korean auteur has dared (by way of the polyglot casts and funding sources for 2013’s _Snowpiercer_ and 2017’s _Okja_), Bong has finally hit the jackpot by sticking close to the homegrown class-combat arena of his earlier films, and perhaps it’s not just ardent fans of _Memories of Murder_ (2003) and _Mother_ (2009) who are relieved to see him abandon heavy-handed CGI parables and get back to the pathological nitty-gritty.

_Parasite_’s impact has been swift and praise near-unanimous. With a worldwide box office already deep into nine-figure American-dollar territory by November, it seems to be a launch of hilarious nastiness so expertly crafted that barriers of imported-film popularity collapse at its feet. The movie’s precision-cut gearwork – smacking as much of Wile E. Coyote narratives as of Hitchcock and the Coens – may be its most powerful intoxicant, surprising yet inevitable, cascading satisfyingly toward disaster like a Rube Goldberg machine that eventually sets the house on fire.

At the same time, it may be that Bong’s signature cynicism, and his spiked electrocardiogram style of narrative (pathos, meet comedy; comedy, meet savage violence) may be a jigsaw piece to fit our 2019 puzzle moment, when we’re rarely sure whether to bray or gasp or weep at daily reports of what our fellow Homo sapiens are doing to each other, and to our social contract. From Brexit to Trumpitania to Turkey and Hong Kong and the Philippines, etc, the frayed power cables of class are setting fires, and the poor-on-rich-on-poor blood circus that _Parasite_ rolls out for us may scan widely as both emblematic and prophetic – expressing the little-left-to-lose stress of now, and our suppressed dread of whatever could be coming next.

By itself, _Parasite_ is a perverse kind of crowd-pleaser, although its neatly sewn-up plot high jinks make for easier swallowing than the haunting ways in which his earlier films defiantly remained open-ended. But by hitting so many buttons so beautifully, and by vacuuming up audiences without the imported benefit of ripped-headline subject matter or feel-good candy coating, Bong may have made it safe again for daring transnational distribution. _Parasite_ may be the grown-up gateway drug millennial and Gen X moviegoers of every language have been waiting for – a step forward for which Park Chan-wook and Lee Changdong, for two, should be thankful. In the process, Bong may have finally fashioned himself, and his taste for empathetic mayhem, into a world brand for the ages.
