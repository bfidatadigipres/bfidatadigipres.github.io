Pedro Almodóvar has let his hair go grey. Though his bushy locks remained suspiciously dark well into his fifties, now ‘the snows of time have silvered his temples.’ This poetic description comes from the lyrics of ‘Volver’, the bittersweet tango that lends Almodóvar's sixteenth feature its title. ‘Volver’ means ‘going back’ or ‘coming home’. And after the rigours of the male-dominated _Bad Education_ (2004) the new film stages at least six returns: to comedy, to women, to his native La Mancha, to his actress-muses Carmen Maura and Penélope Cruz, to the theme of motherhood in general, and to his own much mourned mother in particular. Almodóvar himself goes further, claiming that this return to his roots is also a celebration of a ‘bright, light Spain’ where a funeral can be a fiesta. It’s a world away from the black legend of Spanish ruralism, steeped in reaction and repression.

But things aren’t quite so simple. _Volver_ suggests that if you go back to the country, you might return with more than you bargained for, not least an undead body in the boot of your car. The film is a tale of two sisters. Feisty Raimunda (Cruz) is a desperate housewife coping with an unexpected emergency: her daughter has accidentally killed the abusive father who tried to rape her. Timid Sole (newcomer Lola Dueñas) has her own problems: on revisiting their native village to attend a funeral she encounters the ghost of their mother (veteran Carmen Maura), who accompanies her back to the city where she has unfinished business to settle.

_Volver_ is the first feature by the famously agnostic Almodóvar to host a supernatural theme. And the superstitious have noted that the director’s sixteenth feature marks six years since his mother’s death and 26 since his father’s, and that in the 1980s Almodóvar made six famous films with Carmen Maura, who is now 60 years old. But more is at stake here than this string of sixes. Once movie-mad Spain has seen a steep fall in its box office over the past year and Almodóvar himself is no longer the most popular person in the industry, having recently resigned from the Film Academy after being snubbed at the Goyas (Spanish Oscars). As _Volver_ opens he is about to receive a rare retrospective at the Paris Cinémathèque, in which his oeuvre is screened alongside those of Sirk and Cukor, Murnau and Renoir. But the director remains a prophet misunderstood in his own land, and one wonders whether with _Volver_ he can rescue an ungrateful Spanish film industry one more time. Will the new Spain, where smoking is banned in public places and same-sex marriage commonplace, wish to see the ghosts of the past resurrected or will it find this uncanny revival of rural roots too embarrassing?

When Almodóvar himself appeared on television to promote _Volver_, he shed tears not for his mother, whom he said was so close during the shoot, but for his father, a much more distant figure. And _Volver_ shows the conscious, even chilly mastery of technique we’ve come to expect from the director’s mature period. Rejecting the tricky flashbacks and reversals of _Talk to Her_ (2002) and _Bad Education_, _Volver_’s structure seems simplicity itself, with Almodóvar cutting coolly between the highly coloured city narrative (the disposal of a corpse) and the plainer rural strand (the encounter with an all too realistic ghost). The shooting style is similarly transparent: the camera tracks fluidly through the gravestones in the opening cemetery sequence, but more often simply sits alongside the women and asks us to pay attention to what they are saying. The occasional high-angle shots come as a surprise, as when Sole is mobbed by mourners or the camera looks cheekily down on Cruz’s cleavage as she slaves over the washing up.

Even the score by Almodóvar’s close collaborator Alberto Iglesias is discreet and unshowy. Deftly following the film’s frequent changes of register, Iglesias offers Hitchcockian strings for the thriller elements and tender harp chords for the supernatural apparitions. Almodóvar no longer needs to prove himself through the flashy visuals and soundtracks that characterised his earlier films, but seems rather to be posing – like his main character – as a simple workhorse. It’s typical that when _Volver_ visits Madrid’s high-tech, Richard Rogers-designed new airport terminal it is only because Raimunda has a part-time job mopping the floors. The director’s achievement is to get us to accept Cruz as an ordinary working woman, even as we (and he) marvel at her beauty. Like the film itself, she combines force and fragility.

The last line of dialogue in _Volver_ is: ‘Ghosts don’t cry.’ Uncovering what he has called (in a typically rural metaphor) ‘a well of emotions’, Almodóvar has shown that after the bracing coldness of _Bad Education_ he can return to deep feeling. It is a move he has made under the pressure of great expectations, both at home and abroad. Indeed, Carmen Maura has described how different it is filming with the director now rather than in the early days, when they were unconcerned by money or fame and just out to have fun.

Almodóvar himself is well aware of how difficult it is to sustain artistic creativity: recently he spoke of Fellini as a director who didn’t know when to quit, and as Spain’s own Fellini – once famous for his love of the grotesque – he must fear that he too will run out of inspiration. But his latest film bears no sign of decline. On the contrary, it continues an unbroken run of some 25 years of artistic and commercial successes that has few precedents in European cinema.

The tango ‘Volver’, sung by Cruz’s character to her dead mother, promises that the encounter with the past is painful, but not impossible. And the film _Volver_ proves that Almodóvar’s body of work is now enriched by facing up to his own past. Suddenly the one-time ‘most modern man in Madrid’ can afford to look behind him, even likening filmmaking to therapy. Almodóvar, for all his silvery temples, is surely at the peak of his powers.
