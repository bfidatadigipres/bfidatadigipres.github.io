_The Host_ provides a perfect introduction to several of the key facets of Bong Joon Ho’s filmmaking that wind their way through his entire oeuvre and make the films feel distinctly his. First is his playful application of genre. _The Host_ is loudly and proudly a creature feature, but it’s one that blends aspects of the Hollywood blockbuster and Japanese _kaiju_ (monster) films with the interpersonal dynamics of a family drama and satirical political landscape. If you throw in the trappings of a kidnap thriller (Bong once argued this, saying that the kidnapper just happened to be a monster), you have an idea of the various genres colliding in this single film and often in a single scene. It makes the film as slippery a prospect as its aquatic antagonist.

Tone is something similarly difficult to pin down in Bong’s films, the atmosphere often shifting from tragic to farcical in an instant. In one scene early in _The Host_, a grieving grandfather solemnly swears vengeance on the amphibious beast that took his granddaughter from him. The camera then pans away and observes over his shoulder as a city official in a biohazard suit walking behind him slips over, as if on a banana peel. _The Host_’s monster was apparently designed with Steve Buscemi’s turn in _Fargo_ (1996) in mind, and Bong’s film shares the Coens’ penchant for careering between bloody violence and broad comedy.

Then there is _The Host_’s political satire, which isn’t woven subtly through metaphor (though that certainly exists as well) as much as played up front. Bong’s films regularly feature protagonists who live at the bottom of the economic pile and who struggle against the overwhelming opposition they face in society. That’s the case here too, but _The Host_ has also been described as the first major Korean film to overtly criticise the legacy of the US in the country – in the opening scene, an American scientist forces his Korean subordinate to pour formaldehyde into the Han, thus creating the film’s monster.

There are various other pointed references to recent Korean history – from the student demonstrations and defence drills of the 1980s to the collapse of the Seongsu Bridge in 1994 – and the film features a Korean-US task force that’s laughably ineffectual in responding to the emergency.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
A monster movie more interested in human relationships than spectacle, _The Host_ is an offbeat genre piece from South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho.  A South Korean and Japanese co-production, it has drawn comparisons with the _Godzilla_ series, which Bong has resisted, claiming there’s a vast difference in scale between the skyscraper stomping super lizard Godzilla and his smaller (perhaps 30-foot-long) amphibious beast. Such distinctions of scale could also be applied to the films’ narratives. The original _Godzilla_ (1954) revelled in the apocalyptic destruction of Tokyo, playing with post-Hiroshima nuclear anxieties. In comparison, _The Host_ is happier shunting its creature to the sidelines. It’s less a movie about monsters, than about how ordinary folk cope with them.

That isn’t to suggest that _The Host_ doesn’t have its fair share of creature feature action. As he proved in his breakout sophomore effort, the gripping police procedural drama _Memories of Murder_, Bong understands the conventions of genre cinema well. The opening reel of _The Host_ delivers a crowd-pleasing adrenalin burst early on; its gelatinous CGI creature (pitched somewhere between a giant acrobatic tadpole and one of _Alien_ conceptual artist H.R. Giger’s Xenomorphs) emerges from Korea’s Han River into a tranquil picnic spot. Stunned onlookers snap photos with mobile phones, then flee in panic as the beast rampages. It’s a masterful sequence, seamlessly blending GGI and live action as citizens are stomped, eaten and batted into the air by the creature’s tail.

After this thunderous mayhem, the monster’s screen time is limited. Bong instead concentrates on kiosk worker Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a near narcoleptic single father whose daughter Hyun-seo (Goh Ah-sung) has been dragged to the beast’s underground lair. The dysfunctional Park family (Gang-du, his siblings and his father) are happier bickering among themselves than actually getting much done. This lets Bong spend the movie’s middle section following their capture by the US military and their subsequent escape, recapture and re-escape, while throwing in much of Korea’s peculiar brand of slapstick. It also allows him to focus on his main theme: the psychological and emotional devastation the monster’s attack has on this family. The allegory of the psychic wounds engendered by Korea’s division into North and South is presented through themes of ruptured families and motherhood.

Significantly, Bong is less interested in anti-communist scaremongering than in showing how this family reunites against a very different monster: the uncaring and incompetent authorities. Bearing the brunt of the film’s anti-authoritarian satire is the US military, which emerges as more of a threat than the creature itself. American incompetence causes the crisis (as toxic chemicals are dumped into the Han River in the prologue) and the US military fails to contain the unfortunate results. Instead of tracking the monster, the Americans waste valuable time chasing a chimerical virus and threatening the civilian population with the dubiously named anti-viral concoction ‘Agent Yellow’. True, _The Host’s_ anti-authoritarian satire never amounts to very much, but it’s intriguingly leftfield.
