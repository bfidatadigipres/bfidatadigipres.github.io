**Bong Joon Ho on ‘Mother’**

_What was it about mothers and the maternal instinct that you wanted to explore in this film?_

I always try to look for another side to that which we always praise or worship something for – like seeing the dark side of the moon. We tend to regard the maternal instinct as being wondrous, holy and noble. But there must be another, darker side to it. That’s the sort of twisted approach that I took.

I’ve heard that Italian mothers are very protective of their sons – that’s why there are so many mama’s boys in Italy! I think Korean mothers are quite similar in this respect. As Korean mothers get older, their sons are expected in some way to take the place of their lovers. So if the son dates a woman or marries her, a strange love triangle forms between the two women and the man. More than half of all Korean TV dramas deal with this theme: parents being against marriage, the troubles between the mother and her daughter-in-law.

_Do-joon, the son in_ Mother _, is a complex character – it’s difficult to tell whether he really is innocent._

At first we brush him off as a simple fool, but as the film progresses it’s obvious that there’s more to him. He’s like a figure enveloped in fog. We want to open up his head and see his thoughts. What does or doesn’t he know? Which of his actions were intended and which were not? I wanted to keep that ambiguous. In the film’s climax there’s a sequence related to the crime. We view his face through the dirty window of the abandoned house. It’s hard to make out his expression – it’s almost as though his eyes and nose have been smudged out. There are a few chilling shots like that. Those sort of visual images describe his character: smudged, erased, unable to be made out.

More importantly, this film is shot mainly from the mother’s perspective and shows the son as she views him. She is very attached to him and loves him dearly, but even she cannot understand him. That’s where the sadness or the spookiness of the film lies. It’s related to the overall theme, too. The mother tries to control and rule her son, but is never really able to know who he is.

_Did you incorporate anything of your relationship with your own mother into  the film?_

No. I don’t sleep in the same bed as my mother and she’s never got blood on her hands! My mother saw the film in May last year. Over the last year, we’ve never discussed it. I guess we both feel that it’s better to not talk about it.

_Kim Hye-ja, the actress who plays the mother, is well known in Korea for playing the role of a mother in films and TV dramas. Did you want to overturn the image people have of her?_

That’s right. There are so many other sides to her – I wondered why she kept playing similar roles and I thought she probably wanted a change too. I’ve thought that way since childhood when I used to watch her on television. I saw she had a dark and slightly crazy side, and I felt attracted to that. She didn’t show that side of herself often, but I remember a drama she was in called _Yeo_ (_Female_). Unlike regular television dramas, it was quite dark and there was a sequence where she had a fit. I felt moved by that and I remember thinking that only Kim Hye-ja would be able to pull off such an act. I remember seeing her when she appeared on a talk show – she had an odd, sort of out-of-this-world way of speaking. I was impressed by that, and that’s the side of her I focused on. This film had to be made with Kim Hye-ja.

_In_ Memories of Murder _you explored the repressive mood of Korea in the 1980s. With_ Mother _, did you wish to make any comment on life in present-day Korea?_

If you had to be strict about it, _Mother_ is set in the present – the characters use the latest cellphones, and they’re important props in the film. However, the past is all mixed up into it. There are motifs from the 1970s, 80s and 90s – the clothes the characters wear, the atmosphere of the neighbourhood or the look of Mother’s home. I think that’s the reality in many provincial areas in Korea, so it was my intention to make it ambiguous when the film is set. This is the case with the location too. You can’t really tell if it’s set in the north or south, in Jeolla or Gyeongsang province. I wanted to break away from territorial boundaries.

In the case of _Memories of Murder_, setting it in the 1980s was important. The theme and the film’s concerns about why the serial killer couldn’t be caught and why the detectives were so unskilled are all linked into the greater darkness of the 80s era itself. In the case of _Mother_, the central focus was on what happened between the mother and son, and what the role of the mother figure is, so I wanted to make the period setting ambiguous.

_Were there any films or directors that were particular influences on_ Mother _?_

I did an interview in the US recently, and one journalist asked me if I had seen Pasolini’s _Mamma Roma_. It does have some similarities, but I only watched it recently on DVD, so it wasn’t an influence during filming. I did watch Hitchcock’s _Psycho_ during pre-production. Of course, Anthony Perkins’ mother is at home dead and stuffed, but I remember thinking if that mother had been alive, her relationship with her son would’ve been similar to the relationship in _Mother_.
