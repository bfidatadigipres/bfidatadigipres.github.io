**Bong Joon Ho on ‘Okja’**

It was quite strange: three different ideas came together seamlessly. Some 16 or 17 years ago, when I’d finished my first feature, I had the idea for a story about a little girl in a mountain village. She finds a rare type of ginseng and travels to Seoul to sell it; various bad guys try to harm or exploit her. Then, in 2010 when I was preparing _Snowpiercer_, I happened to glimpse a huge animal on the street in Seoul while I was in my car. I’m not sure what it was – maybe a manatee? – but I got the strong impression from its face that it was shy and sad. And third, I have a cousin living in the US who is an animal rights activist. Her anecdotes about actions she and her group had taken also got me thinking.

_One of the first things we see Mija do is catch a fish, and it’s cooked for dinner that night. So she’s not vegetarian – and you’re not either, are you?_

I’m not a big fan of steaks, but I still eat barbecues. Not as much as I used to, though. In the film the fundamental issue isn’t factory farming or genetic modification but capitalism itself. Tilda plays twin sisters who present different faces to the world: one nice, cool and sophisticated, the other much more hard-nosed. They’re like two faces of capitalism – one ‘caring’, the other purely profit-driven – but the point is that under the surface they’re exactly the same.

_Yes, the way you present her it’s as if she’s a human embodiment of the corporate HQ on Wall Street. I won’t ask you if you had any real-life companies run by siblings in mind, but I was struck that family-run companies are more characteristic of Korea – the chaebol – than they are of the US._

That’s true, but the Mirando Corporation in the film does have a real-life Western prototype – which the lawyers say I shouldn’t mention. Anyhow, it’s all capitalism!

_This is your second film in a row with a relatively big budget and a lot of CGI. Do you plan to stay on this path?_

Actually, I’ve already started preparing two much smaller films. One is Korean, the other English-language. The Korean one is called _Parasite_, but it’s not sci-fi. It’ll be much the same scale of project as _Mother_ [2009] was. I’ll make it with Song Kang-ho. _Okja_ cost in the region of $50 million, which is not so expensive these days. My producer kept stressing to me that our resources were limited. We shot around 60 per cent of it in Korea, using various locations in the countryside and streets in Daejeon and Gwangju as ‘Seoul’. The motel room sequence with the Animal Liberation Front people is set in the US, but was actually shot in Korea. Filming in New York was too expensive for us, so we did all the American interiors in Vancouver; it’s much cheaper, and there are Canadian tax incentives. But I insisted on shooting the pig-carnival scene on the streets of Manhattan, so we did have a brief New York shoot. I wanted to see this little girl at the very heart of capitalism, so that sequence had to be shot in New York.

_I remember you telling me that you’d had to modify some of the storyboards for_ The Host _[2006] because the CGI would have been too expensive for some of the shots you’d planned. That doesn’t seem to have been a problem here: your ‘strange pig’ Okja is incredibly realistic._

I worked on the design for Okja with Hee Chul Jang, who also designed the monster for _The Host_. He’s an excellent concept artist; he also did designs for the front part of the train in _Snowpiercer_. The actual execution of Okja was in the hands of Erik-Jan de Boer, who’s famous for the tiger in _Life of Pi_ [2012]. He is completely obsessed with animals, watches them in zoos, thinks about them round the clock. There’s no one more alert to the ways that animals look and behave. Making Okja believable was obviously crucial to the film’s success. Whether or not we could create a convincing creature was the question that most worried me before we started making the film.

_You’ve worked with Tilda Swinton and some members of the crew before, but many other collaborators are new for you. How did you pick the key people this time?_

I contacted Jon Ronson after seeing – and very much liking – _Frank_ [2014], which he scripted. I read some of his books first and liked them too, especially the one about psychopathology. I had my Korean script translated into English and gave that to him in New York, where he lives. He was enthusiastic, and we began collaborating; I asked him to focus on developing the English-speaking characters while I focused on the Koreans. Jon, Tilda and I spent quite a bit of time on Skype, sharing ideas and suggestions. In my script I had the character of the has-been zoologist who fronts the corporation’s professed concern for nature and animal welfare [Johnny Wilcox, played by Jake Gyllenhaal], but it was Jon who suggested modelling him on a presenter he remembered from British TV years ago, a guy called Johnny Morris.

I was introduced to Darius Khondji by a great colourist who’d worked on _Snowpiercer_. He knew Darius from the Jeunet films [_Delicatessen_, 1991; _The City of Lost Children_, 1995; _Alien: Resurrection_, 1997], and maybe from _Se7en_ [1995]. We got on well from our first meeting. He’d never been to Korea before, and found that he really enjoyed Korean food.

_The UK press is already reporting clashes between French cinema owners and the Cannes festival management over the issue of screening films that will mostly be seen via streaming. [This conversation took place before the Netflix logo was booed at Cannes screenings of_ Okja _and_ The Meyerowitz Stories _.] Has this controversy reached Korea?_

Yes, the conflicts between Netflix and Cannes are a big thing in the Korean media. When Netflix first became involved with _Okja_, we expressed our hope that the film would have a theatrical life before appearing online, and Netflix seemed very comfortable with that. As far as I know, theatrical runs are planned for the film in some countries, including the UK and Korea. Darius and I agreed that the film should be shot in the Scope format, and it was obviously in our minds that this would mean letterboxing it for the various home-viewing formats. Personally, I’d like as many people as possible to see it on a big screen, and I’m glad that’s how you saw it. Aside from that, I have to say that the working relationship with Netflix was ideal. They didn’t quibble about giving me the right to the final cut, and they didn’t mind at all that the film would be ‘R’-rated. This was nothing like my experience with the Weinstein Company on _Snowpiercer_. Nobody suggested any recutting, nobody made any demands. I wish it was always this way.
