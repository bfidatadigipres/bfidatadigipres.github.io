There’s a line in _Top Gun: Maverick_ that sums up its production maybe more than any other. Appropriately, it’s said in a scene between two of its returning heroes: Tom Cruise’s title character, Maverick, and his old nemesis-turned-wingman Iceman, played once again by Val Kilmer. The pair are discussing their passion for being pilots, looking back on what their careers mean to them. ‘It’s not what I am,’ Maverick tells Iceman. ‘It’s who I am.’

On Friday September 7, 2018, Tom Cruise returned to Miramar, the military base where much of _Top Gun_ was filmed 33 years previously, in the Spring of 1985. He was there to undergo a full ASTC (Aviation Survival Training Curriculum), to qualify for the extensive flying sequences in U.S. Navy F/A-18s that he had personally insisted were essential to the making of its long-awaited sequel, _Top Gun: Maverick_.

As he embarked on a training programme unlike any other in film history, it was impossible to not note the parallels between Maverick and the person who plays him; two men constantly testing the limits of themselves and their profession. Two men also not averse to breaking the odd rule along the way, if that means pushing their craft further than anyone ever has before, exploring its possibilities, stretching its edges.

‘I’d thought about a sequel to _Top Gun_ for all these years,’ says Cruise of only now returning, as actor and producer, to perhaps his most iconic ever role. ‘People had asked for a sequel for decades. Decades. And the thing I said to the studio from the beginning was: “If I’m ever going to entertain this, we’re shooting everything practically. I’m in that F/A-18, period. So, we’re going to have to develop camera rigs. There’s going to be wind tunnels and engineering. It’s going to take a long, long time for me to figure it out.” And I wanted to work with Jerry [Bruckheimer]. I wouldn’t do this movie without him in a million years. For years, people had said, “Can’t you shoot [the movie] with CGI?” And I always said, “No. That’s not the experience.” I said, “I need to find the right story. And we’re going to need the right team. This movie is like trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. I’m not playing.”’

That Bruckheimer factor is essential in understanding what this movie means to the people who have made it – and what it will mean for the audiences soon to experience it, too. Cruise describes Bruckheimer simply: ‘He’s a legendary producer. One of the great Hollywood producers.’ And he should know. It was on the original _Top Gun_ that Bruckheimer and his late producing partner, the equally legendary Don Simpson, took a then 21-year-old actor who wanted to learn it all under, well, their wing.

‘When we started working on this [new] movie, we were working on the script and I looked across at Jerry and I just felt like a kid again, like I was back in 1985, working with him. [Back then] I wanted to learn everything about being a producer,’ Cruise remembers. ‘And Don and Jerry, at a time when I asked to be involved with something, to be in those meetings, were very generous with me. And as we all know, not everyone is like that. _Top Gun_ was the next phase for me [in my career]. For me, like Jerry, I always just wanted to make great stories and entertain the world. That was my purpose.’

On the original movie, although Cruise was filmed in the cockpit of an F-14 Tomcat, his castmates weren’t so successful in their endeavours. ‘We had other actors up there, flying,’ says Bruckheimer. ‘But their footage unfortunately wasn’t usable because they didn’t have enough experience in training. When we put them in the air, none of them could hack it. Tom was the only one we had usable flight footage for. We had tons of footage of the other actors in the air with their eyes rolling back in their heads. This time, thanks to Tom, all the actors on _Top Gun: Maverick_ became accustomed to the fundamentals and mechanics of flight and G-forces, because of all the training they did months in advance. Unlike the first film, our actors are actually in the cockpits of the F/A-18s in flight, acting and speaking their lines of dialogue.’

That seismic shift is not just about an increase in aviation authenticity, either. Rather, it is part of an amplification of a number of factors that made the original _Top Gun_ resonate so strongly. ‘In this movie we very much wanted to have a more developed group and a greater sense of the pilots around Maverick,’ says writer and producer, Christopher McQuarrie, the _Usual Suspects_ Oscar®-winner who has collaborated with Cruise since writing _Valkyrie_ in 2008, and has since written and directed him in one _Jack Reacher_ and two _Mission: Impossible_ films, with another two on the way.

‘One of the things I said to Tom early on was that the original _Top Gun_ was not just about Maverick. It wasn’t just about Maverick and Goose. It was about a culture,’ McQuarrie observes. ‘It was about the culture of these pilots and the competition that they all had with one another, and we wanted to bring some of that in. As a result, all the pilots in this film are more richly drawn. It’s a deeper bench but also a richer canvas. That tapestry of pilots all help to serve an understanding of who Maverick is now. Obviously, this movie takes place over 30 years later. And we didn’t want to stop the movie and reflect upon what those 30 years were. We wanted you to feel that history unfolding while you were watching the movie.’
