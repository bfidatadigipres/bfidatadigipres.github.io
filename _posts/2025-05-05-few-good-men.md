In Rob Reiner’s riveting courtroom drama, Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee’s moral compass is put to the test when a murder with hints of institutional wrongdoing takes place inside the famed Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Young navy lawyer Kaffee shares many traits with _Top Gun_’s Maverick: both men belong to the US armed forces, both fall for their impossibly beautiful and charmingly antagonistic superiors (here played by Demi Moore), and both navigate life with the borderline obnoxious confidence of people who’ve faced little hardship.

It’s in the differences between the two, however, that Cruise displays a significant refinement of his craft. Whereas Maverick wobbled towards the cartoonish in his expression of frustration, Cruise’s Kaffee is less exaggerated, harnessing the fear of his impending courtroom defeat to effectively convey desperation.

In 1988, 27 year-old playwright Aaron Sorkin completed the first draft of his play _A Few Good Men_. Sorkin’s agent sent the play out and it was soon brought to the attention of producer David Brown. Although stage rights to the play had not yet been sold, Brown immediately bought the film rights. Enthusiastic about the project, Brown then bought the stage rights and, after bringing in Broadway producers Lewis Allen, Robert Whitehead and Roger Stevens, began plans to mount the stage production.

As Brown comments, ‘When the play was brought to my attention I was already familiar with Aaron Sorkin’s one-act play _Making Movies_ which got a very good review in the _New York Times_. I went to a couple of readings of _A Few Good Men_ and, impressed, I then brought along Lewis Allen and his wife, playwright Jay Presson Allen. They loved the play and Lewis and I decided then to produce it.’

Sorkin suggested that Don Scardino be hired to direct the play and casting began in June of 1989 with rehearsals beginning that August. The play was first given a two-week try out at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Then a four-week run was staged at the Kennedy Center in Washington. After two weeks of previews in New York the play opened on November 15 at The Music Box Theater. It ran for 449 performances and became Broadway’s longest running drama.

‘The performance opening night was magical,’ says Brown. ‘We knew word-of-mouth would make the play a hit so we got the advertising going and we waited. The people soon soared in and we had a standing ovation almost every night for two years.’

It was during the Broadway run that Rachel Pfeffer, at that time Vice President of Production at Castle Rock Entertainment, brought the play to the attention of Castle Rock principal Martin Shafer. Castle Rock soon purchased the film rights to the project although Reiner himself hadn’t the chance to go to New York to see the play. When he did see the production he was simply overwhelmed.

‘I saw it just to see if it was something I might want to direct, and I fell in love with the play,’ Reiner recalls. ‘It was so emotional and powerful that I was just knocked out by it.’

Reiner committed to direct the motion picture and within only three weeks, Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson and Demi Moore were signed to star in the film.

Reiner was fascinated with the material from two perspectives: the first was the theme of a moral dilemma in a military setting; the second was the personal struggle of Kaffee, struggling to emerge from under the shadow of his famous father and find himself. Reiner was able to relate to this struggle on a personal level.

Says Reiner, ‘I’m always asked if I intentionally choose to direct such a diverse range of pictures, but I don’t think of it in those terms. I think, “What’s in this film that I can relate to and that appeals to me.” _Misery_ happened to be a thriller, but what appealed to me was an artist’s struggle to break out of a mold. It’s something I can relate to. What appealed to me here is Kaffee’s struggle to find himself. This theme is set inside a courtroom drama which is then part of the challenge because I’ve never done anything like this before.’

Aaron Sorkin began to write his screenplay during a continuous interaction with Reiner and producer Andrew Scheinman resulting in a work that Sorkin feels surpasses the play.

‘Rob, Andrew and I originally sat down for five days with a bulletin board and index cards,’ says Sorkin. ‘We said, okay, this is the loosest possible structure of how this is going to be made and we made our way through the screenplay. Then I wrote a new “first draft”. The best part about working with Rob as a writer are the questions he asks because they demand answers and they demand that holes be fixed. He’s got a fantastic sense of structure and drama. After another month of going over it every day in his office we had a second draft. Then we had a table reading with Tom Cruise and were on our way.’

Rob Reiner concentrated his efforts on developing the struggle that Kaffee goes through to establish himself as separate and apart from his father; an idea only hinted at in the play. Reiner also felt that the climactic courtroom confrontation needed to be altered.

‘I felt it was important that Kaffee not go into the courtroom armed with a smoking gun as he did in the play,’ says Reiner. ‘Instead, I felt it would be more impressive and satisfying if Kaffee was in there flying by the seat of his pants, using all of his intelligence to take on this big case, not sure whether or not he would win. I saw it as David taking on Goliath.’
