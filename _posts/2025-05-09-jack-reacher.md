_Jack Reacher_ is based on _One Shot_, the ninth in the series of Lee Child’s novels, so why begin in the middle, as it were? Producer Don Granger says, ‘_One Shot_ is perhaps the most cinematic of all the books. Within the novel are presented several elements that we thought were important in a first movie. First, I think it’s got one of the very best introductions for Reacher – it’s a great way to bring him into the plot that’s already in motion. But secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, there’s a moral dilemma for him. He comes into the story believing one thing, and then has to realise that the facts are perhaps pointing in a different direction. He then has to decide whether to take the easy way out of this, or the tougher way, and in that decision, we get to realise why Jack Reacher’s different from any other movie hero.’

To take such a hero and transfer him to the screen would also require both a writer and a director comfortable with both action and enigma, with complex, detailed set pieces, big and small, and characters whose loyalties and motivations are suspect at best. In filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie, it became a case of one-stop shopping.

McQuarrie had to get much of the narrative out of his head without losing Reacher’s unique worldview. ‘It was about finding an interesting way to visualise his unique perspective so that it wasn’t always Reacher telling you exactly what he was thinking. Lee was so fantastic and so supportive throughout. If it worked, I think it’s largely because Lee and I really clicked on what we thought was most important to highlight about Reacher’s thought processes and outlook and how to translate that in a visual way,’ McQuarrie says.

The movie, of course, is anchored by the title character, played by Tom Cruise.

‘We really wanted to focus on an actor who could bring the gravitas the skill and the talent to make this a memorable role. And more importantly, someone who could bring out Reacher’s personality, which is very specific. When we told Lee who we were thinking about casting as Reacher and how we’d come to that conclusion, he was great about it. He said, “Why wouldn’t I want the biggest movie star who ever lived to play the character I created?”’ McQuarrie says.

For Cruise, Child’s stamp of approval was key. ‘Firstly, I’m very sensitive to it. This is Lee’s book and Lee’s character. His blessing was crucial to me. If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done it,’ says Cruise.

Cruise was thrilled, of course, to play Reacher, an incredibly rich, compelling and unique force of nature with such an archetypal code of honour.

‘Reacher is such a great character. He doesn’t have a cell phone, he doesn’t have email. He’s an analogue guy in a digital age. He’s off the grid. He pays for things in cash. People look at things through the prism of the colours of their life, but Jack Reacher does things the way we want to sometimes. In that sense, he’s sort of a Dirty Harry, a James Bond, a Josey Wales,’ Cruise says.

While Cruise does not resemble Reacher as described in the books, Child says that Cruise captured Reacher’s ethos and that was more important than any physical likeness.

‘Cruise, at his core, is a character actor in the most literal sense. He really gets into a role. He understood Jack Reacher. He projected his vibe. But the only real answer to that is, go see the movie. I guarantee you will come out of it, thinking, “What was I worried about?”’ Child sums up.

Moreover, McQuarrie notes, the physical attributes described in the book are nearly impossible to find in any performer. Recalls McQuarrie: ‘We were never going to find an actor who fit the rather extreme physical characteristics as are described in the books, so we decided first thing that could not be our primary concern.’

More important, McQuarrie says, were the unique characteristics that make Reacher so captivating that he knew would resonate with Cruise on a personal level. Reacher is a man comfortable in his own skin, a quality that intrigued McQuarrie and especially appealed to him in terms of how Cruise might inhabit that.

‘What I really like about Reacher is he’s a completely confident and centered individual, and a very comfortable loner. More than anything, he’s self-assured and very in tune with his environment,’ McQuarrie explains. ‘Most of the characters Tom is accustomed to playing in movies – he’s usually a man under intense pressure, and driven by the pursuit of the object of the plot. Reacher is somebody who never experiences pressure, who lets the entire story come to him. When you spend any time with Tom you realise that, as a person, he’s a lot more like Reacher.’

Which is not to say that Cruise is a vigilante or loner – rather, Cruise shares Reacher’s personable side. Even in the most stressful situations, Reacher displays a dry wit combined with a genuine concern. Reacher is not bombastic – he is thoughtful, deliberate and also, when he’s not under attack from bad guys, good company.

‘What was really exciting to me,’ McQuarrie continues, ‘was to be able to put Tom in a role where he’s playing somebody closer to himself, someone who’s a lot cooler, a lot more relaxed, a lot more amiable. What we were going for with Reacher is not really an intensity, but more a matter-of-factness. He seems to understand how everything is going to happen around him, and is just waiting for it to occur. Even down to his first big fight with the townies – he basically tells the guys, “This is the way the fight’s going to go,” and that’s how it goes. He gives them every opportunity to walk away, and they don’t do it.’

It helped to have a willing and supportive partner in Cruise, who also serves as producer. McQuarrie and Cruise worked together on _Valkyrie_ and found they shared a similar cinematic sensibility and passion for films; they have engaged in an ongoing conversation about movies ever since. Their shared love of certain films – and even muscle cars – found their way into the fabric of _Jack Reacher_.

‘It has elements of a thriller and a suspense film, along with a very strong romantic streak running under it. What we’re trying to do is a little bit of a throwback, in style and tone, to the movies that Tom and I grew up on, the movies we really love. We were really trying to avoid a lot of the modern conceits of the genre. It has a feeling of Americana that has somewhat disappeared, and it’s something that our character is looking for,’ McQuarrie notes.
