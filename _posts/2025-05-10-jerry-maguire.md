Jerry Maguire, a slick, high-flying sports agent working for a giant company has doubts about the ethics of his industry. When he proposes there is a better, kinder way for taking care of clients he is fired. But one co-worker and a sole client believe in him. Cruise was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for his energetic performance in this funny and heart-warming romantic sports drama. His performance is passionate, earnest and infectious, ensuring this soothing golden balm of film stays with you long after the credits have rolled.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
The director Cameron Crowe is maturing at the same rate as the characters whose lifestyles he has chronicled. After high school (depicted in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_, which Crowe scripted from his own book, and in his directorial debut _Say Anything_) and the twentysomething Seattle scene (in _Singles_), he reaches pre-mature midlife crisis and finally comes of age as a filmmaker with _Jerry Maguire_. Though the film eventually builds to a conventional Hollywood climax – Rod Tidwell is signed by the Arizona Cardinals, while his vindicated agent Jerry realises that success means nothing without love – Crowe’s script takes some unexpected turns on the way there. For a start, Jerry’s conversion from ‘just another shark in a suit’ to man with a mission statement, which many Hollywood writers might have made the meat of their story, is dispatched in the first five minutes.

Thereafter, it’s Jerry’s increasingly flailing effort to get himself back on track, professionally and emotionally, which occupies centre stage. A very fluent writer of dialogue, Crowe defines his central character through a succession of terrific speeches in which Jerry seems to be trying to convince himself, as much as his listeners, of his love, idealism, commitment or business acumen. But every time Crowe seems in danger of being carried away by his own eloquence, he finds a way to deflate it. For instance, in Jerry’s final reconciliation scene with Dorothy (Renée Zellweger), played incongruously in front of the divorced women’s support group who congregate at the home of Dorothy’s sister Laurel, Jerry is in full flow when Dorothy cuts him off with the words, ‘You had me from “Hello”’.

Ultimately, though, it’s not any great novelty in conception or technique that makes _Jerry Maguire_ stand out. It’s simply that, unlike so many big, mainstream studio movies, it delivers all that it promises – comedy, romance, satire and American football – with a consistent sophistication and lightness of touch, and a whole gallery of brilliantly sketched incidental characters, such as Chad the jazz-obsessed babysitter. Jerry’s relationship with Dorothy is refreshingly complex: responding to the devotion and loyalty she has displayed, he feels that he has a duty to love her. Dorothy later confronts Jerry with the realisation that while he loves her six-year-old son Ray (another Hollywood pothole, the cute kid, here effortlessly negotiated by Crowe and the young Jonathan Lipnicki), he merely likes her. Jerry’s overdeveloped sense of personal responsibility, a fine thing in his dealings with Rod Tidwell, becomes something of a liability as the basis for a marriage. And despite the feelgood ending, there’s no real reason to believe that Jerry and Dorothy’s problems are at an end, when they are reunited; it’s possible that he has just convinced himself he loves her out of his reluctance to lose.

The role of Jerry wasn’t written specifically for Tom Cruise (Tom Hanks was Crowe’s first choice), but it suits his glossy screen persona perfectly, and significantly deepens it, bringing out the panic in his trademark nervous energy and the emotional repression in his clean-cut, curiously asexual romantic image. There’s one great scene where Jerry and Dorothy are eating out with Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr) and his equally irrepressible wife Marcee (Regina King), who launch into a very physical display of affection which Jerry vainly tries to match by kissing Dorothy chastely first on the hand, then on the forehead. It’s almost as if at the start of the film, Jerry is the regular Tom Cruise – the slick, cocky operator who gets what he wants – and as it progresses, the layers are stripped off.

At one stage, as his clients desert him and his deals go awry, it looks like Jerry Maguire may be a Willy Loman for the 90s. The happy ending, of course, undermines that, and also the film’s earlier attack on the greed of players and their agents. ‘This isn’t show friends, it’s show business,’ snaps Bob Sugar, the former friend who poaches Jerry’s clients. The sense that Crowe’s satire is aimed as much at Hollywood, another business run by agents, is strangely mirrored by recent reports in the US press that a letter by Walt Disney Company CEO Michael Eisner, exhorting his troops to more honourable business practices, may have been rather closely ‘inspired’ by the text of Jerry’s mission statement. Rod, whom Jerry has criticised for playing for money rather than love of American Football, is eventually rewarded not just with a crucial touchdown, but also with a new contract beyond his wildest dreams. So Jerry’s idiosyncratic, humane way of representing clients turns out to be very sound business practice after all, no doubt netting him a healthy percentage of Rod’s $11.2 million.
