In the film that marked the beginning of Cruise’s collaborations with his recent _Mission: Impossible_ writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise plays Claus von Stauffenberg, the German Colonel who led the near-successful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Initially restrained, Cruise’s performance grows in intensity as the tension increases. He leads an all-star cast of British thespians and the result is a richly detailed, well-constructed and often unbearably suspenseful historical thriller.

Before shooting had even been completed on director Bryan Singer’s _Valkyrie_ – an account of the failed attempt by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and members of the German resistance to assassinate Hitler – the film threatened to become overshadowed by the storm of controversy it had provoked in the German media. Much of the furore centred around the casting of Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg, with the actor’s professing of scientology (categorised as a ‘dangerous cult’ by the German government) central to most concerns. A spokesman for the German Protestant church went so far as to say Cruise’s involvement would ‘have the same propaganda advantages for scientology as the 1936 Olympics had for the Nazis’. Stories circulated that filming had been hampered by restrictions, with permission to shoot at Berlin’s Bendlerblock initially denied. A relative of Stauffenberg was quoted as saying, ‘I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of this project.’

‘The press reaction did surprise me,’ recalls Singer. ‘But I could understand the hesitation: it would be like a German coming over here and making a film about Lincoln. The immediate reaction was “Here’s the director of _X-Men_ and _Superman_, and the star of _Mission: Impossible_, what kind of film will they make?” But once people saw our attention to historical accuracy, the controversy calmed, even if it still echoed in the press. It didn’t have any practical impact on the production.’

Fears that the film would sensationalise the plot as a kind of _Mission:_ _Impossible_-style exploit are wide of the mark, for, if anything, the film is at times an overly linear and sober depiction of the events that led up to the attempt. Aside from some compression of the chronology and the omission of some of the minor figures involved in the plot, the script by Nathan Alexander and Christopher McQuarrie is meticulous in its fidelity to the historical facts.

‘I had meetings with members of the Stauffenberg family and with experts in the German resistance,’ Singer explains. ‘I had lunch with Hitler’s bodyguard, who was also the communications man who reestablished contact between the Wolf’s Lair (the Nazi base where the assassination attempt took place) and the propaganda ministry following the assassination attempt. As eerie as it was, we had first-hand conversations about that day.’

‘Mostly the references I used weren’t other films; I looked more to old newsreel and photography of the time. I was very keen that the film should look vibrant. So often films set during the Nazi-era are desaturated because filmmakers want to make it look like black-and-white images. I tried to make a film that looked like it would have to people at the time.’

The first half of the film is careful to explain the background influences that led Stauffenberg and the other members of the resistance to risk the assassination attempt. There was a strong class aspect to the resistance. Men like Stauffenberg were drawn from the aristocratic Prussian military class and viewed the Nazis as a bunch of thugs led by a lowly Austrian corporal. ‘Stauffenberg came from a 900-year-old family who had served kings,’ says Singer. ‘He had great pride in the longevity of Germany as a great nation. These people were not Nazis, they had never been party members.’

Stauffenberg was also a Catholic, something only touched on in the film. ‘I wasn’t making a biopic,’ Singer clarifies. ‘It was important for me that the film be a thriller about the assassination attempt. I left out anything that didn’t help to get us to the assassination. His Catholicism was just one facet of his drive.’ Was Singer worried that such a complex figure would be smothered by the star baggage Tom Cruise inevitably brings to any film? ‘We made a conscious effort for Tom to give a contained performance, to embrace the reputation for calm, cool grace under pressure that Stauffenberg had. The action and the deed are so great that the performance should be as contained as possible.’ Alongside Cruise is a who’s who of heavyweight British talent: Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp, Tom Wilkinson and an unusually restrained Bill Nighy among them. ‘I was looking for the best actors,’ says Singer, ‘and I have a history with British actors like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.’

Early previews of the film have met with a mixed response from German critics, with many claiming that Cruise’s performance fails to capture Stauffenberg’s aristocratic bearing, but Singer has shown it to members of Stauffenberg’s family, who expressed their approval. ‘It went extremely well. People thought we were going to make some other kind of movie, but the story is so tense that we didn’t need to change any of it.’
