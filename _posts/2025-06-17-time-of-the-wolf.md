**Michael Haneke on ‘Time of the Wolf’**

_How dramatically has_ Time of the Wolf _changed in the ten years since you wrote the script?_

The script didn’t change at all. The one thing that did change is that originally it was going to be a three-hour film. The first hour was to have taken place in an indeterminate European capital in which things are slowly starting to go wrong. There are problems we don’t quite understand: the water doesn’t work and neither does the electricity. This was to have been set in a ghetto for rich people such as you find in some American and South American cities, enclaves with police protection. Then one of the families decides it would be easier to go to their country house. And that’s exactly where the finished film picks up. After 11 September 2001 I felt it was no longer necessary to explain this buildup. It’s now easily conceivable we could be faced with a similar catastrophe.

_Trying, as you do, to avoid Hollywood-style button-pushing moments, what do you structure your films around?_

The danger with the catastrophe genre in Hollywood is that it’s one of exaggeration, so it makes catastrophe seem attractive – something we can enjoy because it’s so unrealistic. My work consists of trying to reach people on an emotional level, raising the level of audience identification as high as possible by avoiding overt stylisation or exaggeration. Lots of people have talked about the fact that many of the sequences in _Time of the Wolf_ are very dark on the screen. That has the simple explanation that at night, in a country deprived of electricity, it is going to be very dark. And people react in the dark in an entirely different manner. If someone is coming towards you on a well-lit street, they simply go past and that’s that. But if you’re in the dark that person is perceived as a threat. Lighting the film minimally allows the audience to experience this unease and fear.

_But how do you build a drama when you’re deliberately eschewing so many established techniques?_

_Funny Games_ is structured like a classical thriller despite the fact that it’s a parody. But in this case the structure arose through following the way people would respond in a situation like this. And as a development of such events in terms of character, this is very classical too.

It begins with individuals with individual problems. People who can’t cope with these themselves then join groups and as the groups become larger the problems change.

_Are you a big consumer of science fiction?_

I’ve read the classics – the novel of _Solaris_ and Olaf Stapledon’s book _Last and First Men_ – but I’ve probably read only ten science-fiction books in my whole life. And I’ve seen even fewer films. I like _Blade Runner_ and obviously _Solaris_, though I don’t see that so much as a science-fiction film, more a metaphoric film. I’m not a huge fan of these films, especially as so many of them are dumb.

_Did you look at any science fiction in order to consider what not to do?_

I don’t know enough about the genre to be able to avoid or to seek out these problems. But making a science-fiction film would interest me very little. _Time of the Wolf_ is about contemporary society – currently four-fifths of humanity live in conditions far worse than those depicted here. The only thing I did was to take those living conditions and transpose them into our geographical area. Catastrophes for us are things that take place somewhere else. So this is not a film for the third world – they don’t need to see it. This is for the wealthy nations.

_Did you do any special preparation with the cast?_

In all my films the actors are placed in difficult situations. I’m not a huge fan of long rehearsals – in my experience, when you do that you reduce the spontaneity. I worked for many years as a theatre director and there the rehearsal time is much longer, but when it comes to making films I prefer to work on the problems on set.

_The camera style is about pushing the light to the limits. Was it derived in part from a particular idea of cinema?_

The idea was always to depict things as closely as possible to the way they would be. Usually when you’re shooting in the dark it’s enough to have one spotlight illuminating things. Here we shot the scenes in the barn, with the cigarette lighter and the straw, with natural light, but everything else became very difficult. You needed a little bit of lighting but it needed to be very diffuse, otherwise it would look like a spotlight. So, for example, when the girl is sitting on the railway track a little below her brother, they had to light up the whole scene, a vast area, with non-specific lighting.

_There are separate killings of a horse and a goat, both very realistic. Since the British certification authorities take these matters very seriously, how were these scenes achieved?_

The goat was given a tranquilliser. If you look at the shot closely you can see it’s still breathing. We had blood on the blade of the knife so it looks as if the goat is bleeding. There are two shots of the horse. First you see it falling when it’s shot – it was trained to do that on command. The horse whose throat was cut was going to be killed anyway and the shot was taken in a slaughterhouse. It’s so hypocritical, the censorious reaction, especially from carnivores.

_You invoke several semi-religious myths – the group of the 36 Just people, which is also a Judaic story, and the people who can redeem the human race by jumping into fires._

Each of these stories can be understood one way or another. Ben is willing to sacrifice himself in the flames for the good of the community but we have no idea if the story he’s heard from the man who swallows the razorblade is true or not. And that’s also the point made by Jean (Thierry van Werveke), the man who saves Ben from the flames. He says that maybe tomorrow things will be different, and that what counts is the intention, the fact that the boy was ready to take that step. How this works is for each spectator to decide for themselves. In the same way, the story of the Just people is told by a woman whom most spectators will think is crazy, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that the insane often reveal the truth. Such stories inevitably evoke a religious or mythological context and I deliberately leave the interpretation open.
