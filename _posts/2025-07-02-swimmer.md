**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
Leaves rustle and twigs snap, sending a rabbit scurrying to its burrow and a deer into the foliage, as a man treads his way through autumnal woods in Connecticut. But in this case the intruder in nature is also an intruder in civilisation; as Ned Merrill (finely played by Burt Lancaster), with his healthy, tanned body clothed only in a pair of bathing trunks, emerges on to the concrete pool-side patio on the exurban estate of some one-time friends, he seems as out of place among the paunchy executives with their Sunday hangovers as he did among the deer and rabbits. Like his physique, his determination to swim in the pool that serves merely as a status symbol and backdrop for open-air cocktails marks him out – as a god or as a freak – from the wealthy world into which he has wandered.

But his friends are delighted to see him again after so many years, and enquiring after his wife are reassured to learn (in the phrase that will become a kind of litany) that ‘Lucinda’s just fine and the girls are at home playing tennis.’ And as Merrill sips a ritual drink with them, looking across the country with its lush vegetation punctuated by tiny, chemical blue pools, the project for his minor odyssey takes shape: he will swim home to his wife via the chain of pools which he sentimentally christens the Lucinda river.

The project for him is an heroic one, and the distance of the nine-mile journey that formed the basis of John Cheever’s remarkable _New Yorker_ story is left unspecified in the film, thus taking on the epic proportions that it acquires in Merrill’s mind. But as his pilgrimage gets under way, its peculiar pathos slowly becomes apparent. The nature to which the swimmer returns is itself the product of the synthetic society he is trying to transcend – earth-filtered water captured in tons of structural aluminium and clear plastic. His journey forward becomes a journey backward in time, the welcome that awaits him at each pool becoming less friendly as he gets nearer home. Echoes of unresolved grievances and encounters with former friends (an old lady who holds him responsible for her son’s death; a hostile hostess who hints that his daughters are alcoholic sluts; a pair of ageing nudists who refer obliquely to his bankruptcy; the ex-mistress who alludes to his wife’s frigidity; a grocer’s wife embittered by his unpaid bills) turn the voyage of discovery into one of  self-discovery.

By the time Merrill has limped across the freeway (shades of _Lonely Are the Brave_) into the shrieking crowd at the municipal pool, his dream has become the nightmare confrontation not just of the plastic waste land of American civilisation but of his own failure. The ascent of his private Everest has become a descent into his private hell; until, with the darkening sky mirroring his visible disintegration, his efforts most resemble those of a salmon struggling upstream to die on the spawning grounds. Inevitably when the swimmer – in blinding rain – reaches his home, there is no smiling wife, no playing children: the tennis court, like the deserted house, is overgrown with weeds, and he beats in vain on the door.

As if in answer to those critics who objected to the tidiness of his first film (_David and Lisa_), Frank Perry’s _The Swimmer_ deals deliberately in loose ends; and the different jigsaw pieces of Merrill’s life never entirely fit together. The vagabond swimmer suffers throughout from a kind of emotional amnesia, believing his own lies about his family, with no recollection of what or where he has been for the past few years. There are hints of several possibilities that he has been leading a Rousseau-esque existence in the forest, has murdered his family, or escaped from an asylum – but the ‘right’ answer is never supplied. Though his film has all the ingredients of a whodunnit (or a who done what?), Perry tantalisingly withholds the final answer, showing one man’s inability to face reality without specifying the particular form that this reality takes.

Whatever it is, Merrill’s nostalgia for a heroism that has become unattainable, his desire to play Peter Pan in a land of Captain Hooks, is shown as something only children can understand. The lonely child selling lemonade by the roadside while his mother is abroad on yet another honeymoon manages for a moment to share the swimmer’s dream; the teenage babysitter (a splendid, Lolita-ish first performance from Janet Landgard) joins for a while in the adventure, thrilled when Merrill quotes the _Song of Songs_ at her, but recoiling when he strokes the belly he has likened to wheat, his words constructing a romantic fantasy while his actions – as throughout the film – betray the ‘suburban stud’ his brittle but vulnerable ex-mistress denounces in the final encounter.

According to Hollis Alpert in _The Saturday Review_, this sequence was originally made by Perry with Barbara Loden, and then re-shot, at producer Sam Spiegel’s request, by Sydney Pollack with Janice Rule. Certainly it has a sharper edge than the rest of the film. For it is in spite rather than because of the direction – with its slow motion idyll, cigarette commercial photography, psychedelic shots of the sun, soft-focus verdure and heavy symbolism – that Cheever’s story survives as a powerful and disturbing film.

First of all, RESPECT, because in mid-July I will become a father. I don’t yet know whether to a son or a daughter, but I shall let you know as soon as I do.

Secondly, have you seen _La Natation par Jean Taris_ at Les Miracles?

Filmed above and below water. The creature and its environment are beautiful, but… Jean Vigo is not Jean Painlevé. And that’s that!

**Letter from Jean Vigo to Jean Painlevé, Nice, 28 May 1931**

This film on swimming champion Jean Taris, commissioned from Vigo by Germaine Dulac and shot in the early months of 1931, is often considered, within the context of his work, a minor film; it is sometimes ignored. Instead, it has the name ‘Vigo’ clearly printed on it, even if the director himself only loved the sequences shot underwater. He would recall them when shooting _L’Atalante_. But there’s more: the ‘swimming in a room’ scene is unusual and funny, as are Taris’ tricks and his winks directed towards the viewer, when, completely dressed, he walks on water. It was Vigo’s first experience working in sound, at a time when mixing did not exist. The filmmaker was able to create a counterpoint between the human voice and the sound of water in movement.
