**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_Alphaville_ is the story of special agent Lemmy Caution, played by American actor and naturalised _noir_ icon Eddie Constantine, who has voyaged (in his white Ford Galaxy) across time and space to Alphaville, the capital city of a distant planet. His mission: to bring back the scientist Professor von Braun. The Professor, however, has since become king of the city by creating Alpha 60, the computer that controls Alphaville along harsh technocratic lines: weeping is outlawed and poetry goes unrecognised, words such as conscience and love have been erased from the lexicon. Add to this Anna Karina as Natacha von Braun, daughter of the Professor, who is loved by Lemmy; Constantine’s whisky-drinking, poetry-spouting, outrageously overdetermined hard man of a special agent whose ﬁght sequences, as Wim Wenders noted in his essay on the actor, ‘are like dance sequences in a bad musical’; and Raoul Coutard’s cinematography, the luminous opposition of its Expressionist black and white matching the ﬁlm’s abstract absolutes of good and evil, love and death, conscience and technology, poetry and science. Plus, of course, Paris.

Alphaville is Paris, 1965. Or rather, Paris 1965 is Alphaville, a modernist nightmare of post-Bauhaus functionalism where the curtain-walled skyscraper becomes the simultaneous symbol of progress and apocalypse. With _Alphaville_ the _nouvelle vague_ aesthetic of shooting in the streets reaches an apotheosis. _Alphaville_’s is a short-circuited realism applied to the least likely of genres – science ﬁction – that serves to make strange a real already so strange that it positively demands the strategy.

Part of the modernity of the _nouvelle vague_ can be attributed to the use of new lightweight Éclair cameras and Nagra sound-recording technology to bypass the convention of studio-based shooting associated with the despised cinema de qualité. This allowed the new ﬁlmmakers to take to the streets and boulevards, quartiers and apartments of the real city, all the better to mythologise its historic centre. In the January 1967 issue of _Cahiers du cinéma_, the young Bernardo Bertolucci wrote of Godard’s ‘vulgarity’ adding that for him this was a positive quality: ‘I call ‘vulgarity’ his capacity and his ability to live day-to-day, close to things, to live in the world as does a journalist, always aware of the right time to arrive on the scene.’

The characterisation was to stick – Godard the modernist exotic, fascinated by the surfaces, sounds and shapes of modern Parisian life but not by its substance. It was a barely veiled accusation of proﬂigacy of style and theme, of bad taste, of formlessness and lack of aesthetic harmony – forgetting that in Godard’s case the old rules simply don’t apply and never did.

The ‘blurring’ of Paris in the cinema of the _nouvelle vague_ is a chronicle of the incursions into the city centre of modernist architecture and of the cultural ascendancy of Le Corbusier and the International Style. As a result, the characters lose their bearings – and worse their love of the city. It is just such a fear that informs _Alphaville’s_ image of an architecturally brutalist future world in the heart of the city. In its despair over 60s urbanisation, _Alphaville_ was part of a wider concern about the perceived dehumanising effects of mass-scale housing and the contemporary renovation of the city.

**‘Alphaville’: a contemporary review**  
Like _The Red Desert_, _Alphaville_ is concerned with alienation in a technological society – Natacha is a robot restored to humanity by Lemmy’s love – but Godard’s method is far removed from Antonioni’s minute, patient analysis. There are times, Alpha 60 gratingly announces at the beginning of the film, when reality is so complex that it can only be transmitted through legend; and Godard accordingly proceeds to work through legend, or two legends, to be precise. There is the legend of Lemmy Caution shooting up his opponents and winning the pretty lady with the traditional, uncomplicated, strip-cartoon brutality; and there is also the poetic legend of Cocteau. It is no accident that echoes of Cocteau’s work abound here: Lemmy’s interrogation by Alpha 60 recalls the tone and style of Cégeste’s aphoristic poetry (‘_Quel est le privilege des morts ?’ Ne plus être vivants_’); when Alphaville is destroyed, people stagger down labyrinthine corridors or cling blindly to the walls, like the inhabitants of ‘La Zone de la mort’; and at the end, as they escape from the city, Lemmy tells Natacha, like Eurydice, not to look back.

It is through this curious marriage of legends that _Alphaville_ makes its comment: in a world rendered arid by technology, it is left to the brutal, matter-of-fact Lemmy to take over the mantle of Orphée and recall the existence of poetry; and in the beautiful central sequence of the film, the illogicality of poetry is born again as Lemmy forces Natacha to seek for the meaning of forgotten words like ‘tenderness’, ‘conscience’ and ‘love’. It isn’t so much that Lemmy (God forbid!) is poetic – his dialogue and thoughts for the most part remain characteristically monosyllabic – as that he alone in _Alphaville_ is aware that neither he nor anybody else can live in a world deprived of poetry and feeling.

Without benefit of special lighting or trickery, Paris stands for Alphaville simply by having Coutard’s superb photography present an icy, dehumanised view of it as a city of glittering lights and staring windows, a warren of push-buttons and heartlessly clicking machines in which Natacha, wide-eyed and hesitant, presents the one source of warmth. This is a world in which one cannot trust appearances, and Godard invents the perfect human detail to go with it: the hotel chambermaid (‘Séductrice, Troisième Classe’) with the identification tattoo on her neck, making guests comfortable by putting tranquillisers in the bathroom and stripping invitingly to her underwear; the down-and-outs squatting in the suicide hotel on the other side of town, nibbling cereals out of the packet; bored guests politely applauding executions at the municipal baths, while a bathing belle-executioner acknowledges their tribute with a graceful arabesque in the water. _Alphaville_, in fact, is the first science fiction film to offer the uneasy reminder that our own world is already more than halfway to science fiction.
