‘What is a cult film? A cult film is one which has a passionate following but does not appeal to everybody. Just because a movie is a cult movie does not automatically guarantee quality. Some cult films are very bad. Others are very, very good. Some make an awful lot of money at the box office. Others make no money at all. Some are considered quality films. Others are exploitation.’ From 1988 to 2000 _Moviedrome_ was presented by Alex Cox and then Mark Cousins. Across that time, more than 200 features were shown, and generations of movie fans and filmmakers would be informed and inspired by the selection, alongside the wit and wisdom of the introductions that preceded each screening. _Moviedrome_ was a portal into the world of weird and wonderful cinema. This two-month season features some of the most notable titles screened and wherever possible they are preceded by the original televised introduction.

**Alex Cox:** _Get Carter_ is a nasty British gangster film. For some reason, all British movie gangsters are extremely nasty – from Richard Attenborough’s Pinky Doyle in _Brighton Rock_ in 1947 through Richard Burton’s and Bob Hoskins’ anti-heroes in, respectively, _Villain_ (1971) and _The Long Good Friday_ (1980), up to and including _The Krays_ (1990). All our gangster heroes (unlike Edward G. Robinson or Jean Paul Belmondo) are schizoid, sadistic arseholes who shoot people in the kneecaps and sentimentalise about their mums. Rather like the real thing, in fact.

Jack Carter, a racketeer from London, goes up north to Newcastle to attend his brother’s funeral and wreak ‘orrific vengeance on the Geordies who did him in. Carter is played by Michael Caine, who’s really good as the fastidious brute, investigating an unseemly trail of cover-ups, bribes, double-crosses and sudden violence. He is an evil man; the only difference between him and his adversaries is that they are not as self-righteous as he. In that way, _Get Carter_ resembles _High Plains Drifter_ (in which Clint Eastwood pretends to save a western town in order to destroy it) or a Jacobean revenge play.

On the train up north, Carter reads _Farewell My Lovely_, but he’s no Philip Marlowe. Nor is he even a Yojimbo, Kurosawa’s samurai hired assassin in the film of the same name. _Get Carter_ was directed by Mike Hodges in an energetic early 1970s’ style, at a time when American studios were investing heavily in British films. As well as splendid Newcastle locations, it features cameos by Ian Hendry (as Eric Paice, the scheming chauffeur) and the noted playwright John Osborne in the role of Mr Big.

In bringing Ted Lewis’s novel _Jack’s Return Home_ to the screen as _Get_ _Carter_, its makers had a speciﬁc approach in mind: the violence, for once, could not be choreographed in the established movie manner, where the hero would scarcely be scratched after receiving a severe battering. They wanted to show violence truthfully – and it is this heightened sense of realism, amongst other factors, that has helped to make _Get_ _Carter_ one of the most memorable and inﬂuential British ﬁlms of the early ’70s.

The book rights had been bought by producer Michael Klinger, and Michael Caine decided to go into partnership with Klinger (already a friend) to get the ﬁlm made. ‘It was a chance to show gangsters as they really are’, says Cain. ‘The tradition in British ﬁlms until then, with the exception of _Brighton_ _Rock_, was that gangsters were either very funny or Robin Hood types, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Not a realistic portrait, I think you will agree.’ This was also the view of the man Klinger and Caine chose to script and direct their project, Mike Hodges.

‘Until then, gangsters had been kind of jolly characters in British ﬁlms,’ says Hodges. ‘But there was a meanness to them as well as a softer side, and I really wanted to bring this out. I wanted to give the ﬁlm that sense of hardness you saw with the Krays and the Richardsons when their cases ﬁnally went to court. I wanted to be as honest as I could with the original material, and ended up making the ﬁlm even harder than the book.’

One aspect of the book slightly altered by Hodges was the character of Carter. ‘In the book the character’s much softer,’ he explains. ‘Remember when he’s in the bar and asks for his drink in a thin glass? In the book he says, “In a thin glass please.” It’s interesting. Michael gave him an edge – he really knew Carter and made him much more ruthless than he was in the book; harder and much more cynical. However, although you knew this man was sick – that he was psychotic – there was a sadness in him. He knows he’s different. Embedded in the hardness is something that makes you realise that he knows there’s something about him that’s rather sick.’

Because of its violent (not to mention sexual) content, the ﬁlm came in for inevitable criticism. ‘Mike Hodges did a great job on the picture. Maybe too great, since when it came out we were slammed by most critics for the violence,’ says Caine. ‘It was too realistic for people who had become used to the choreographed nonsense you usually saw in those days.’ Indeed, the American critic Pauline Kael described the ﬁlm as ‘virtuoso viciousness’, and even today it comes across as strong stuff.

‘I think that in its own way it was ahead of its time,’ prefers the director. ‘I remember Don Siegel seeing the ﬁlm and being completely stunned, because nothing quite like it had come out of Britain before. I think its quality inﬂuenced many other ﬁlms, too. You’d think that inﬂuence would destroy it, because it’s been seen so many times, but it just seems to grow in stature. It’s hard and ruthless, without a shadow of a doubt. At the time it probably appeared even more so, though we’ve had a lot of ﬁlms since which have been even more sadistic.’ Another reason for _Get_ _Carter_’s success is that it’s a cracking story, very well cast and perfectly told. It is the ultimate in hard-edged realism – and a production ﬁlmmakers should continue learning from for a long time to come.
