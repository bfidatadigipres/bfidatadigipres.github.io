_The screening on Wednesday 9 July will be introduced by season curator and Moviedrome’s producer Nick Freand Jones_

‘What is a cult film? A cult film is one which has a passionate following but does not appeal to everybody. Just because a movie is a cult movie does not automatically guarantee quality. Some cult films are very bad. Others are very, very good. Some make an awful lot of money at the box office. Others make no money at all. Some are considered quality films. Others are exploitation.’ From 1988 to 2000 _Moviedrome_ was presented by Alex Cox and then Mark Cousins. Across that time, more than 200 features were shown, and generations of movie fans and filmmakers would be informed and inspired by the selection, alongside the wit and wisdom of the introductions that preceded each screening. _Moviedrome_ was a portal into the world of weird and wonderful cinema. This two-month season features some of the most notable titles screened and wherever possible they are preceded by the original televised introduction.

**Alex Cox:** _Two-Lane Blacktop_ is, after _Easy Rider_, the king of the road movies. It came out in 1971, around the same time as Francis Ford Coppola’s _The Rain People, Five Easy Pieces_ and Richard Sarafian’s _Vanishing Point_. All of these are equally pessimistic variations on the same theme – which is, according to Rudy Wurlitzer, the writer of this film, that ‘you can’t escape from whatever you’re trying to escape from, and the lesson of the road is that there is no lesson of the road’.

_Two-Lane Blacktop_, based on a TV movie script by Will Corry, tells the story of two existential hot-rod racers, played by the singer James Taylor and Dennis Wilson, drummer of the Beach Boys. They become involved in an obsessive road race with a flash Harry character played by Warren Oates, all competing for possession of a pink slip – that is, a car registration or ownership certificate. The two hot-rodders drive a souped-up old car; Oates has a brand new Pontiac GTO. The two mumble a lot and are really bad actors. Oates has the most amazing line of patter and incredible adventures. Also watch out for Harry Dean Stanton as the gay hitch-hiker.

The director, Monte Hellman, is a mysterious figure, who has made few films but has had a great deal of influence on his peers – Coppola, Peckinpah, the other road-movie directors, and especially Wim Wenders. Hellman and Oates did their best work in collaboration, particularly in _Cockfighter_, a film which unfortunately we can’t see in Britain due to its subject matter. Oates was a great actor, one of the best of all American actors, and he lights up this film every time he appears.

**Monte Hellman on ‘Two-Lane Blacktop’**

_What interested you in the original script for_ Two-Lane Blacktop _? And what did you think was missing?_

The fact is that I’ve never been presented with a script I liked. Here I liked the idea of two guys travelling across the country in a ‘55 Chevy challenging guys to race. The rest of it was banal.

_What intrigued you about [Rudy] Wurlitzer’s writing?_

I liked his sense of humour. He was extremely funny. I think all my scripts are funny.

_What were you after in this film?_

I was interested in what has happened to love, for one thing. What contemporary attitudes towards love are as opposed to traditional attitudes, and how much romance is left in a non-romantic world ... I don’t know how much _is_ left in the world, but there’s a lot left in our movie. We’re in a world where love has been rejected, but people still have a nostalgia for it, and I think that’s what we deal with in this film.

_Are you a romantic?_

I’m romantic in the sense that Camus was romantic. I ... feel a nostalgia for what cannot be.

_Would you describe_ Blacktop _as a love story? Who loves whom?_

I always felt it was a love story. The girl loves the driver; the mechanic loves the girl and the driver, and he can’t decide between them and can’t accept his love for either. And the driver wants to love the girl, but can’t.

_I’ve always felt there was a profound absence of love in_ Blacktop _…_

Well, I’ve expressed these things to Rudy, but I don’t know if he wrote exactly that story ... Maybe audiences will see it differently, too. But I’ve always seen the driver as the same sort of character that Aznavour plays in _Tirez sur le pianiste_. He appeals to me too. It’s a guy who is so involved with his own existential dilemma, just dealing with himself as a person, that he throws away the thing he wants most, which is love. He can’t deal with those needs in time, and that becomes his tragedy.

_You don’t think the cars, the roads, and the quintessential Americanness of the characters are significant?_

That’s just a cultural appendage ... side effects. A way to augment the reality.

_You haven’t mentioned one of the two major characters, G.T.O. (played by Warren Oates). What function does he serve?_

G.T.O. is time ... God, that sounds pretentious. Look, I’m evolving, I’m getting older. My films have to reflect this. G.T.O.’s function is as a reference to the process of time. A reminder of mortality. The idea of time is a double-edged element. The illusion and delusion of time ... Cars, roads, speed are one thing. G. T.O. sings ‘Time Is on My Side’. Well, it’s not. And the love thing is involved with him too. The temporal nature of love, or at least of sexual love. He has been through it. He’s part of the generation gap.

There is a confusion in people’s minds about what the essential elements of a movie are. We create ‘genres’ – the road picture, the melodrama, the Western ... I don’t think those are good categories. Certain movies are made over and over again, each through a different director’s vision. The prototypes for _Blacktop_ are Minnelli’s _The Clock_, Lelouch’s _Un homme et une femme_, Nichols’ _The Graduate_, Wilder’s _The Apartment_. They are all the same story, told against a different background.
