**Paul Thomas Anderson on ‘Boogie Nights’**

_One of the things that’s interesting about_ Boogie Nights _is its tone shifts, for instance between dramatic and comic/parodic._

There are two answers to that. First, two of my favourite movies are F.W. Murnau’s _Sunrise_ (1927) and Jonathan Demme’s _Something Wild_ (1985), what I call gearshift movies, that can change tones _[snaps ﬁngers]_ like that. I like to see that in movies because that’s what real life is like, and it’s also good storytelling. And second, this relates to how I came to this story. The first version was a short film I made called _The Dirk Diggler Story,_ when I was 17. That has some of the same textures, but it’s much funnier. It’s my point of view as a 17-year-old, and what was funny to me then was the titles. As a mass audience, we’re amused and turned on by porno titles – _Ordinary Peepholes, The Sperminator, Edward Penishands –_ but then this is quickly not funny. There was something in that short film that was darkly comic, but there were a lot of smartass moments. Over the course of ten years, just by getting older and slightly sick of it all, that’s where more of the sadness and drama comes into it. I just sat there and lived with it and it was just not fucking funny anymore.

_Do you still watch porn and has your viewing changed? Do you watch it as narrative, all the way through, rather than fast-forwarding to the fuck scenes?_

The porno you fast-forward to get to the action are today’s films. They’re movies for consumers and the makers are aware that the home viewer has a fast-forward button – that’s why there is no paying attention to any kind of plot or story. The audience is at home going, ‘Where are the tits? Where’s the dick? How can I get to it fast?’ That’s why _Boogie Nights_ romanticises the heyday of porno – you can’t watch it at home, you’re going into a theatre.

_Artistic aspiration or self-improvement consume all of the main characters in_ Boogie Nights _one way or another. But your response to porn films seems to be a camp one: you don’t expect genuine artistic value._

None are successful on the terms that I would consider make a great film, even a great porno film. But there are those – like _Three A.M at the Jade Pussycat, Amanda by Night_ and _The Opening of Misty Beethoven –_ that get A for effort and have their heart in the right place. With genuinely wonderful moments of intent, of storytelling approach or shot choice – or cinematic approach to shooting a sex scene. Then there’s whether it’s a successful sex scene that can turn me on. One thing I was really fascinated by was the structure in the ‘Johnny Wadd’ series – in _The Jade Pussycat_ for  instance, which combines a murder mystery with a sex film. It set up – with some bad acting but also some good acting – a mystery plot: where is the Jade Pussycat? So in the journey to find it, there are these set-pieces of sex in between solving the murder mystery. You want to see the story progress and see him find the next clue, but you’re also there as the guy who sat down to watch a porno movie, wanting him to have sex with that girl he’s getting the clue from.

_Which is Jack Horner’s ideal._

Absolutely. And I’d be a liar if I didn’t say Jack’s probably talking for any young romantic idiot like me who has notions of trying to make a good movie. It certainly projects my feelings onto him.

_When you talk about porn as a genre stifled before it got going, what direction did you hope for?_

Where I romanticise it could have gone was a place where acting, storytelling and camerawork got better. With interesting characters where you also had the luxury to show them fucking. We can’t see Forrest Gump fuck Jenny Curran, to make that kid. But God, wouldn’t that be a great scene? Not just because I want to get off watching Tom Hanks fuck Robin Wright, but think what can be told about Gump through watching him have sex. Here’s this big long movie investigating this guy – well, what’s he like in bed? What’s that like for him? That’s a big human question.

My romantic notion is that if porno films had been allowed to breathe, and the stories eventually really did come first, then we would have been able to see an actor playing a role and then being able to try on a new way of having sex in a scene. Like trying on an accent. Which would do away with the gratuitous obligatory sex scene that every movie has to have, which is the ultimate bullshit moment.

_So you see contemporary porn as a fallen form?_

Pretty much, yeah. I still find it interesting to watch some of it. There’s a series called _Dirty Debutantes:_ when I first saw it, the mythology was that the porn star was gone, and it’s amateurs now, ‘real-life people’. So it was wonderful when I realised that _Dirty Debutantes_ was maybe 80 per cent faked. They’re _not_ ‘real people’ recruited off the street: most are actresses – a version of people off the street as they haven’t done too much work, they mustn’t be recognisable – but they have agents, porn agents. So now watch them again – you’ll see some of the best acting you’ve ever seen.
