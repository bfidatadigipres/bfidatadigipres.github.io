‘What is a cult film? A cult film is one which has a passionate following but does not appeal to everybody. Just because a movie is a cult movie does not automatically guarantee quality. Some cult films are very bad. Others are very, very good. Some make an awful lot of money at the box office. Others make no money at all. Some are considered quality films. Others are exploitation.’ From 1988 to 2000 _Moviedrome_ was presented by Alex Cox and then Mark Cousins. Across that time, more than 200 features were shown, and generations of movie fans and filmmakers would be informed and inspired by the selection, alongside the wit and wisdom of the introductions that preceded each screening. _Moviedrome_ was a portal into the world of weird and wonderful cinema. This two-month season features some of the most notable titles screened and wherever possible they are preceded by the original televised introduction.

**Mark Cousins:** The Bronx-born writer, Richard Price, published his first novel, _The Wanderers_, aged 24. Its success led him to write _The Color of Money_ and _Life Lessons_ for Scorsese, as well as the Al Pacino film, _Sea of Love_. In 1994, after two years research, Price published his fifth and hugely successful novel, _Clockers_, about crack-cocaine pushers who work around the clock and live in New York projects. His main character was a 19-year-old dealer called Strike. Price had Strike suffer by giving him a stomach ulcer. He had him dream of escaping by making him obsessed by trains. And he intercut this with equally vivid scenes of his antagonist, a detective played by Harvey Keitel in the film. We’re about to see what Spike Lee made of Price’s story.

Lee’s previous film, _Malcolm X_, had done badly at the box office but that didn’t stop him being a major spokesman for Black America. Since 1980 with films like _Do the Right Thing_ and _Jungle Fever_, he’d become a media celebrity, intellectual force and thorn in the side of white Hollywood. The combination of Lee’s political stance, stylish use of camera and music and business savvy made him an ambiguous figure. He’d speak fiercely about the bleak prospects of project teenagers, then make a Nike advert to sell them trainers at $80 a pop. Lee took Price’s mythic story and mixed it with some of the ideas and style of Scorsese’s _Mean Streets_. Casting Harvey Keitel, making some of his characters almost saints, as Scorsese had done, lighting the bars red. He hired a newcomer, the 27-year-old Malik Hassan Sayeed to be his cinematographer and together they came up with a highly coloured, high-contrast, sensuous look, filled with what Lee calls ‘Chinese angles’, after the Kung-Fu movies he loves. The photography was widely praised and Hassan Sayeed has recently been working on Stanley Kubrick’s Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman film, _Eyes Wide Shut_. Terence Blanchard did the music. His fifth Spike Lee collaboration.

_Clockers_ only took $13million in America and I think that’s because its first half is very loose, a mood piece rather than a story. The plot tightens after that. Lee has since made two quite preachy films: _Get on the Bus_ and _Four Little Girls_, but this one is far richer, I think. Right from the moment we first see Strike, played by newcomer Mekhi Phifer, walking out of the project like some Arthur Miller Everyman, Lee seems to worship his character. Scorsese did too, of course, but his origins were working class, in his point-of-view we’re right down there amongst his subjects. Lee, the son of a jazz player and teacher, is more of a middle-class observer. There’s a grandeur about _Clockers_ and a lack of grit, which makes it flow like honey; and Keitel’s interrogation scenes are as stylised as of any other filmed. _Clockers_ has none of the controversy of _Do the Right Thing_ and many people argued that it didn’t explain why some people are sinners in this world and others are saints. Why does Strike get caught up in it all? Where does his brother’s saintliness come from? These questions are open. Lee is rattling the cages again. See what you think…

**A contemporary review**  
_Clockers_ opens with a title sequence that’s bravura even for Spike Lee. The camera travels over a succession of grisly police photos of murder scenes – Black male bodies torn apart by bullets. Behind a yellow police tape, crowds of Black faces watch a nightly spectacle of bloodletting that’s both too immediate and too removed to be comprehensible. At once didactic and operatic, this opening positions us for the film that follows. What’s most startling about _Clockers_ is its intimacy. Lee puts us inside the skin of a kid who seems morally reprehensible at the outset, making the agony of his experience inescapable.

Lee’s choice of camera placement and movement has never been more brilliant. The camera’s erratic rhythms and circular patterns articulate the extreme confinement of Strike’s world and his panicky sense of being held in a vice. Similarly, the narrative, though dense with incident, seems to turn in on itself, covering the same ground over and over again. Everything in Strike’s world – the repetitive riffs of rap music, the claustrophobic space of video games, his fetishised electric trains that circle a single track even as they testify to the existence of unknown and distant places – reinforces the feeling of confinement.

In terms of form and content easily Lee’s riskiest and most accomplished film to date, _Clockers_ is not without its flaws. In focusing so much on Strike, Lee makes the other characters one-dimensional. Newcomer Mekhi Phifer makes an amazing Strike, so much like an ordinary kid it’s hard to remember that he’s acting. Yet such extraordinary actors as Isaiah Washington, Delroy Lindo, Harvey Keitel and John Turturro are strait-jacketed by the script and direction.

Lee encourages cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed to extend the experiments with the cutting together of various types of film stock begun by Arthur Jaffa in Lee’s _Crooklyn_. Sometimes this method yields expressive results, as in the flashback sequences which have the texture of over-saturated 16mm Kodachrome. Just as often, the effect is purely decorative, as in the burnt-up look of the police interrogation scenes which seem borrowed from Oliver Stone’s _JFK_.

The film seems infinitely more powerful on the second viewing, and even more so on the third. Desolate, hallucinatory and fearlessly heartfelt it is the ’hood movie to end all ’hood movies. In its violence, there is neither glamour, nor pleasure, nor release.
