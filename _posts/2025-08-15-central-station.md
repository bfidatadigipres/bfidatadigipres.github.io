In 1991 the renowned director Hector Babenco declared that ‘Brazilian cinema is dead’. Argentine-born, but a naturalised Brazilian citizen, Babenco was lamenting a calamitous turn of events for his adopted country’s film industry. Brazil’s first democratically elected president after more than 20 years of military dictatorship had, somewhat ironically, withdrawn all state funding and support for culture, including films. The move decimated Brazilian cinema. An industry that had been producing 100 films a year under the dictators did not make a single film that year.

But Fernando Collor de Mellor’s reign was as short as it was corrupt and, by 1992, he had been impeached. Within two years the Audiovisual Law was introduced, to help revive Brazilian filmmaking.

Between 1994-2000 nearly 200 feature-length films, fiction and documentary, were made in Brazil, in what became known as the ‘_retomada de producao_’ – literally, the resumption of production, but thought of more as a rebirth. And one of the most significant moments of the _retomada_ came in 1998, when Walter Salles’s _Central Station_ won the Golden Bear in Berlin, heralding the return of Brazilian cinema to the international scene.

We hear the sounds of the eponymous Rio de Janeiro train station before we see it: the announcer, the sound of trains, the bustle of commuters. Then a melancholy theme tune plays as people disembark, and a crying woman speaks in close up – into the camera – declaring her feelings to her lover. She is replaced by a smiling old man, who thanks the person who cheated him, and another woman, who declares, ‘Jesus, you’re the worst thing to happen to me.’ It’s as touching, intriguing, immediately embracing an opening as that of any film.

These declarations are being written down by Dora (Fernanda Montenegro), who is offering a novel service, writing letters for the city’s many illiterates so that they may connect with friends and loved ones. But Dora is a middle-aged cynic: instead of posting the letters, she reads them to her friend for amusement, before pocketing the postage charge. That is until events conspire to leave a young boy, Josué, in her care, along with the task of finding his father, the aforementioned Jesus. The pair leave Rio for the northern province of Pernambuco, and Brazil’s arid hinterland, the _sertão_.

Thus _Central Station_ concerns a boy’s search for the father he has never known, and a woman’s rediscovery of a sense of decency she has long forgotten, buried beneath the pain of her own familial losses. It is also a director’s discovery of his own country, lost on screen during his cinema’s years in the wilderness.

There are road movies in which the locations are irrelevant, merely a backdrop to adventure, and those, infinitely more interesting ones in which the road and what is found on it are integral to the character’s interior journey. _Central Station_ belongs firmly in the latter category. The road movie is Salles’ preferred form – he also made _The Motorcycle Diaries_ and adapted _On the Road_. And it is the clue to his international appeal: whatever the specificity, national or continental, the road movie ‘well travelled’ will connect with anyone who has wondered about his or her place in the world.

In _Central Station_ we see two aspects of Salles’ filmmaking approach: the formal and the organic. On the one hand, meticulous care is taken over composition, particularly in the Rio scenes where the framing and shallow focus evoke the alienating effect of city life; on the other, real life is permitted to seep into the film, not least when non-actors make their way before the camera, often impromptu. When Dora and Josué encounter a pilgrimage in the _sertão_, the whirl of preachers, fortune tellers, musicians and hawkers is patently real. Of course there are moments – for example, when the boy runs through a candlelit night – when the two tendencies memorably merge.

Salles doesn’t attempt to ignore the country’s problems: the Rio scenes are genuinely disturbing, and the scenes in the _sertão_ suggest little promise of a comfortable life. Most of the people we encounter are caught in a pincer movement of illiteracy and blind faith.

Nevertheless, the film remains essentially optimistic. And that optimism extends to the world behind the camera. After screen-testing 1,500 boys for the role of Josué, Salles found Vinícius de Oliveira by chance. ‘Actually, he found me. He was a shoeshine boy. I was wearing sneakers, so he couldn’t clean my shoes, so he just came up and asked me to lend him some money for a sandwich. I said, “Of course I’ll buy you a sandwich, but do a film test with me”. He said he couldn’t, because he had never been to the movies before. But ultimately he came, he did a test, and was brilliant.’

Salles cast the boy on the condition that he return to school. More than that, de Oliveira studied cinema at university, has continued to act, and starred in Salles’s _Linha de Passe_ (2008).

With _Central Station,_ Salles proved himself to be both a humanist and a pragmatist: caring for his characters and the world he depicts, and also having a care to the accessibility that will help a film connect with a wider audience. This pragmatism, commercial savvy if you will, informs the major Brazilian films since the _retomada_ – particularly _City of God_ – to have touched both local and international audiences.

The late BFI chairman Anthony Minghella said of _Central Station_: ‘That small Brazilian movie touched more hearts than almost any other movie I know of. It announced a real voice in international cinema.’ The film won a British Academy Award for best foreign film and was nominated for best foreign film and actress Oscars. But perhaps its greatest success was in enabling Salles to enter the ranks of viable, international directors, one who could begin to influence and support his fellow filmmakers in Brazil.
