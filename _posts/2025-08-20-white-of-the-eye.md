‘What is a cult film? A cult film is one which has a passionate following but does not appeal to everybody. Just because a movie is a cult movie does not automatically guarantee quality. Some cult films are very bad. Others are very, very good. Some make an awful lot of money at the box office. Others make no money at all. Some are considered quality films. Others are exploitation.’ From 1988 to 2000 _Moviedrome_ was presented by Alex Cox and then Mark Cousins. Across that time, more than 200 features were shown, and generations of movie fans and filmmakers would be informed and inspired by the selection, alongside the wit and wisdom of the introductions that preceded each screening. _Moviedrome_ was a portal into the world of weird and wonderful cinema. This two-month season features some of the most notable titles screened and wherever possible they are preceded by the original televised introduction.

**Mark Cousins:** Tonight, one of the best films about a serial killer, from one of the most maverick directors. Donald Cammell’s _White of the Eye_.

_White of the Eye_ is a film about a very disturbed character called Paul White, former hunter and now a hi-fi engineer who may or may not be a serial killer. It was directed by Donald Cammell, one of the strangest figures in modern American and British cinema, I think. He was born in Edinburgh, he was one of the key figures in London in the sixties, friends with Mick Jagger etc. He co-directed _Performance_ with Nicolas Roeg, and then went to America and worked with Marlon Brando through the ‘70s. In 1977 he made a film, _Demon Seed_, which we showed on a previous _Moviedrome_ and 10 years later he made this film, _White of the Eye_. Throughout his life Donald Cammell was very interested in themes of suicide and therefore it wasn’t a surprise that at the age of 62, in his house in LA, with his wife China there, he shot himself in the head. He survived for between 10 and 30 minutes thereafter and apparently spoke lucidly and wasn’t in pain. This is of course a very dramatic thing to happen at the end of someone’s life, but in some way any other filmmaker it would have been a surprise, not him.

Donald Cammell used to say of himself that there was the professional Donald Cammell, the filmmaker, and then what he called ‘the uncensored Don’ and it’s a bit like Jekyll and Hyde, and of course _Jekyll and Hyde_ was partly to do with the city where he was born, in Edinburgh; and what I think is so good about this picture is that it seems very much to come from the Mr Hyde side of his personality, the dark, the disturbed, the depressive side, the ‘life is a pile of shit’ side of him. And he’s not afraid to give a very unvarnished view of men and of America and things like that. And I think that’s what’s unusual and that’s what makes it a _Moviedrome_ film. The book, _White of the Eye_, was brought to Cammell and at first, because it was about a serial killer, he wasn’t interested in it, but then he realised that he could make a movie which addressed some of the themes that he was really interested in.

One of the things about _Performance_, the film that he made with Nic Roeg, was the way that it tried to argue that all people are both masculine and feminine and men are damaged if they are too masculine, and therefore he made this film to be about such a character: a man who was scared of women, scared of his feminine side and goes out and shoots them because of it. You could say that there’s a touch of Oliver Stone about Donald Cammell, who’s very interested in Native American myths and the sense of foreboding that those myths could provide for his story. But at the same time, as well as being interested in things such as desert and the effect the desert has on somebody, he’s also interested in schizophrenia and the relationship between masculinity and femininity in people. This combination of themes – some very sixties themes but others rather timeless – crush into this film and make it a very visually rich tapestry.

The husband in the film is played by David Keith, a kind of Patrick Swayze lookalike, who was very surprised that the director allowed him to go as far as possible, while he wasn’t allowed to change any of the dialogue at all, he was allowed to act very extremely and he, I think, liked that a lot. The wife is played by Cathy Moriarty, who was in _Raging Bull_ also.

Movies these days mostly suck up to their audience, I think, they try to be dead glossy and they try to make you have a very nice time, laugh and cry and all these things. This film is much tougher. It doesn’t really want you to like it, in a way. But it takes you into the mind of a character, takes you into an incredible landscape. It’s wholly cinematic, I think. It tells the story with the camera and that’s the best recommendation you can give.

_White of the Eye_ is Cammell’s most achieved solo work – though, even here, he relied on his wife China Cammell as co-writer. Based on _Mrs White_, a novel by brothers Andrew and Laurence Klavan (writing under the joint pseudonym Margaret Tracy), it’s by default Cammell’s ‘1980s’ movie. Just being a Cannon film locates it in the Reagan decade but it also dwells lovingly on its array of hideous mullets and fluffy perms – it’s even a plot point that all the women in the film except the straight-haired blonde heroine model their look on local rich slut Ann Mason (Alberta Watson). A burbling yet steely electro-acoustic score from Rick Fenn and Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason makes the film’s soundscape comparable to Michael Rubini’s work on _Manhunter_ or Wang Chung’s on _To Live and Die in LA_. Even the 1970s flashbacks have a bleached-out look that screams 1987.

The plot of _White of the Eye_ is squarely in the 80s tradition of Brian De Palma’s MTV Hitchcockery, talking-point slasher movies such as _Fatal Attraction_ or _Jagged Edge_ and ‘mad dad’ horrors like _The Shining_ and _The Stepfather_. It skews away from crackpot male self-exploration and the objectification of murdered women, as exemplified by serial killer Paul White (David Keith), a sound expert who installs stereo systems in the homes of wealthy clients, towards a critique of the attitudes embodied in most commercial thrillers of the period, thanks to the livewire performance of Cathy Moriarty as Joan, Paul’s loving yet angry wife.

As the work of a European artist stranded in a hallucinated America, _White of the Eye_ bears comparison with John Boorman’s _Point Blank_ (1967), Ken Russell’s _Altered States_ (1980), Wim Wenders’s _Paris, Texas_ (1984) or Louis Malle’s _Atlantic City_ (1980). Cammell shifted the location from the Connecticut suburb of the novel to the environs of Tucson, Arizona. This enables him, like every other British filmmaker given the chance to put on a cowboy hat, to evoke the Wild West of the movies and also the myth’s latterday hippie incarnation as the playground of hallucinogenic Native American wisdom. It incarnates the New West in a cowboy-talking, Indian-sympathising protagonist who uses weird Apache humming techniques to map out the soundscape of a room before installing stereo speakers. However, he’s also a woman-hating murderer. Cammell’s work is shot through with mysticism of various forms but he was self-aware enough to have his heroine take a cold, clear view of her husband’s Carlos Castañeda rationale for disembowelling women and call bullshit on it.
