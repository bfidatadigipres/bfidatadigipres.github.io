‘What is a cult film? A cult film is one which has a passionate following but does not appeal to everybody. Just because a movie is a cult movie does not automatically guarantee quality. Some cult films are very bad. Others are very, very good. Some make an awful lot of money at the box office. Others make no money at all. Some are considered quality films. Others are exploitation.’ From 1988 to 2000 _Moviedrome_ was presented by Alex Cox and then Mark Cousins. Across that time, more than 200 features were shown, and generations of movie fans and filmmakers would be informed and inspired by the selection, alongside the wit and wisdom of the introductions that preceded each screening. _Moviedrome_ was a portal into the world of weird and wonderful cinema. This two-month season features some of the most notable titles screened and wherever possible they are preceded by the original televised introduction.  
**Nick Freand Jones, season curator and producer  of _Moviedrome_**

**Alex Cox:** ‘Electra Glide’ is the name of a full-dress Harley Davidson motorcycle that was manufactured in the United States. A few years back, all motorcycle cops over there used to ride Harleys, but in the 1970s, the Harley Davidson MC Corporation fell upon hard times, and now most American cops ride Japanese bikes, which they call 'rice burners’.

No matter – this is a fairy story about the last honest motorcycle cop in Monument Valley.

Monument Valley is on the Navaho Indian Reservation in northern Arizona – a sacred place.

John Ford discovered it and shot his westerns there; nowadays, they use it to shoot car commercials. _Electra Glide in Blue_ was directed by an American, James William Guercio, formerly the manager of the mellow rock band Chicago. It stars Robert Blake, who is the same height as Alan Ladd to the quarter inch. It was filmed by Conrad Hall who also shot _Fat City_. Today Conrad Hall shoots bank commercials in Monument Valley.

The film is an interesting one. It’s sort of the cops’ response to _Easy Rider_, particularly at the end. It was also very influenced by a gay film, _Scorpio Rising_, directed by Kenneth Anger. Guercio never made another film after _Electra Glide In Blue_; he retired to a ranch in Colorado and was not seen again. A pity, because this is a good film, especially if you like motorcycles.

**A contemporary review**  
Signalled by glowing, apocalyptic images from Conrad Hall, _Electra Glide in Blue_ takes possession of Monument Valley, casting out the ghosts of Ford’s historically idealised past and moving in the meagre props – a few motorcycles, a VW bus, some weaponry – of an a-historical present. Ford’s mythology gained substance through the veneration and nostalgia that surrounded its relics; his ideals of order and community had the reality of an unquestioned belief that men could work together and build. Some chill winds, by comparison, are blowing through the canyons in _Electra Glide_. Veneration is reserved, in one lushly ironic sequence at the beginning, for lonely superman symbols of power as John Wintergreen, pint-sized Arizona motorcycle cop, zips, buckles and buttons himself into his uniform; and when he puts a tentative foot on the ladder of success, partnership turns out to be as bankrupt an illusion as ‘Manifest Destiny’.

It is not merely the epic treatment of the familiar craggy buttes and rolling plains which suggests that James William Guercio, making his first feature, is out to replace the old mythology with a new one. For all its sympathetic portrait of a gentle, well-intentioned cop caught in a crossfire of misunderstanding, _Electra Glide in Blue_ rattles with grand oppositions not really connected to local problems of law and order. The confrontation of Wintergreen (Robert Blake) and his patrol buddy Zipper Davis (Billy ‘Green’ Bush) with the motorcycle freaks who at one point come roaring through the Valley becomes a chase as exhilarating (and as finely shot and edited, forgetting the snatches of slow motion) as a cavalry versus Indians skirmish in Ford. Except that time has contrived to scramble the values, so that it is no longer clear which side represents what in the struggle of civilisation against savagery. And time has also closed down the battlefield: the land looks deceptively, breathtakingly, as if it must go on forever, but the hardest struggles are now waged in men’s minds and become increasingly bizarre, frightening and phantasmagoric.

_Electra Glide_ slides in and out of black comedy with the same ease that its characters tum into highly coloured cut-outs of their own fiercest ambitions: Harve Poole, the superdetective who takes Wintergreen in tow, elevates paranoia to a religion and turns police work into a pantheistic mystery (‘The night is talking to us, Wintergreen. Sit down and listen’); Zipper Davis idles away his duty hours in the shade, adding details to his vision of the perfect motorcycle. The theme of ‘You’ve got to have a dream’, announced with due solemnity by Wintergreen as he anticipates trading his black leather for the cool suit and stetson of a detective, is given the precise absurdity of a comic-strip. It is Zipper who reads aloud from the exploits of Buck Rogers and Co. (space rangers guarding the cosmos ...). The past has been disconnected, but the beautiful technology of the Electra Glide machines is a link with a possible future.
