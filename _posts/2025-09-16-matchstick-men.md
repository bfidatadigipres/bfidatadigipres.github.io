‘People are fascinated with con men like they’re fascinated with mobsters – at least the fictional kind,’ says novelist Eric Garcia, whose manuscript for _Matchstick Men_ was being considered for the screen even before publisher Random House could schedule its first printing. ‘There’s something mythical about them that draws us to them and makes us want to watch them operate.

‘Maybe it’s the idea that they’re using their wits to make a living while everyone else is accomplishing the same thing through toil and effort,’ he muses. ‘I think the lifestyle appeals to us because the day may come when we get laid off or the mortgage is on the line and we’d like to imagine that, given the opportunity, we have the potential to make a quick buck the “easy way” – if only to see if we could do it.’

Garcia, known for his imaginative series of ‘Rex’ books, featuring a modern-day Los Angeles private detective who is actually a latex-disguised dinosaur, is represented by a talent agency whose clients include producers/screenwriters Ted Griffin and Sean Bailey. Garcia’s agent, who loved the _Matchstick Men_ manuscript, sent copies to Bailey and Griffin, thinking it might strike a chord with them.

‘It’s a freight train of a plot with emotional depth, which is rare,’ says Bailey, an Emmy Award nominee as executive producer of the innovative HBO documentary series _Project Greenlight_. ‘It sparked both of us.’ Griffin, who previously collaborated with Bailey on the noir drama _Best Laid Plans_ and was the screenwriter on Steven Soderbergh’s stylish 2001 hit _Ocean’s Eleven_, had a similar response. Jokingly calling it ‘_Paper Moon_ in colour,’ Griffin says, ‘it’s primarily the story of a man coming to terms with himself through meeting his daughter and the relationship that develops between them. The con scenario is essential but secondary.’

Griffin did some prep work by speaking with two FBI agents on the subject of con men. ‘It’s not as far-fetched or antiquated as people might believe,’ he says, dispelling the notion that such small-time crooks only exist in the 1930s nostalgia of _The Sting_. ‘These characters still exist and they’re still running the same old games, but they have also branched out lately to include the Internet and telemarketing.’

Meanwhile, buzz on the project reached renowned filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, who signed on as executive producer, with his ImageMovers Productions partners Jack Rapke and Steve Starkey joining the producing team. All that remained was to find a director to do it justice.

Rapke, who launched his producing career with _What Lies Beneath_ in 2000, following a successful 15-year run as a talent agent, couldn’t have been more pleased when one of his former clients, three-time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott, expressed interest. ‘I was in the agency business for a long time because I love talent and I love to be working with talent and supporting their visions,’ Rapke says. ‘This a wonderful turn of events for me, having been Ridley’s agent, to collaborate with him now in a whole different way in the production process.’

Examining the director’s scope, Rapke notes that ‘Ridley is known for some phenomenally big movies, epics like _Gladiator_ and _Black Hawk Down_ that use giant canvases. He’s certainly one of the great visual directors. But at the same time, he’s good at telling an intimate story with strong narrative, as he did in _Thelma & Louise_ – something with a smaller production scale but still a big cinematic idea.’

Starkey underscores how Scott’s deft touch suited the _Matchstick Men_ scenario. ‘If you look at Ridley’s body of work, you find character pieces in all of his films, even the ones that are better known for their scale and visual impact. At the core of those movies, it’s really about the characters and that’s what makes them work.’

True to form, Scott cites the ‘unusually clever script’ as piquing his interest in _Matchstick Men_. The legendary director has effectively interpreted a range of genres including science fiction (_Blade Runner_, _Alien_), historic drama (_1492_), action (_Gladiator_, _Black Hawk Down_), black comedy (_Thelma & Louise_), psychological/horror (_Hannibal_) and fantasy (_Legend_). While diverse, what they all have in common is Scott’s initial, instinctive reaction to a story or idea.

‘When I choose a project it’s as though a bell goes off in my head, and I listen to that bell, which is my intuition,’ the director reveals. Once the process has begun, ‘all other aspects of a project start to come into focus.’

Acknowledging that the story is essentially a comedy, ‘with humour all the way through,’ Scott notes that ‘it’s also somewhat of a moral tale, which is all the more interesting because it’s filled with characters practicing very bad behaviour. For them, a good day is when they can take a few hundred dollars off a housewife in a Laundromat. They’re not exactly what you’d call lowlifes, but they’re pretty close. Their saving grace might be that their victims are people who are themselves seeking a fast buck or doing things they shouldn’t be doing, so it’s a case of them getting caught with their trousers down.’

As Bailey puts it, ‘We’ve made an honest movie about dishonest people. It’s not a fantasy about the heist of $100,000 million in krugerands by some super-slick criminal masterminds, it’s about skimming a little bit here and a little bit there from ordinary people. Guys like this really exist and this is how they live.’

Overall, says Scott, ‘The humour is very dry, which is good because I appreciate dry humour. But I also like to see someone slip on a banana skin occasionally.’
