**Terence Davies on ‘The House of Mirth’**

_How did the idea for_ The House of Mirth _originate?_

I first read the novel about 15 years ago. And then about five years ago I went to Channel 4 – David Aukin was there at that time – and said I’d like to do it. He said, go ahead. I think it’s a genuine tragedy and a bloody good story. We can all respond to loss of some kind because we’ve all suffered it. That’s what’s so wonderful about it. The other thing I like is that you’ve got a perceived social order but of course it’s not real – people get married for money and status and have their peccadilloes afterwards. Lily doesn’t realise that this is perfectly acceptable. She says in the book, ‘I cannot trade one baseness for another.’ There’s some morality in her that won’t let her do it. And at the end she achieves a kind of salvation and redemption because of that intrinsic integrity.

It’s only after making the film that I realise I was also influenced by movies like _Letter from an Unknown_ _Woman_ or _The Little Foxes._ And also the ‘women’s pictures’ – I loved those films, I mean _All That Heaven_ _Allows_ or _Magnificent Obsession_ or _Love Is a Many Splendored_ _Thing._ Absolute crap, but there’s a great gusto about them. There’s something about the vulnerability of a woman in that era.

_You had a new designer and a new director of photography on this film. What was their contribution?_

Enormous. Production designer Don Taylor, and John Bush who dressed the sets did a fantastic job. And DP Remi Adefarasin is a poet with light. It had to look like John Singer Sargent portraits, but also the _belle époque,_ which was crammed with stuff, dark, like a mausoleum. It’d stifle the life out of anybody.

_Was there a lot of research on etiquette?_

There wasn’t the money. Basically what’s important isn’t what they eat or how they eat but the drama of the piece, and if you’re in the drama you don’t care whether they’ve got the right forks. What I did read was autobiography, and I looked a lot at Sargent and at photographs of the period. I wanted it to look as close as we could get it given it was a relatively small budget, only £5 million.

_There are more close-ups than in your previous work._

It’s the drama of what’s going on behind their eyes. If they look at one another when they’re saying something they don’t mean and then look away when they say something they do mean, that tells you a lot. When Lily says, ‘You forget, it’s part of the business,’ then drops her eyes, that’s telling you a great deal more than the surface meaning. You can only do that if you’re close on them. Really, we have to be intimate.

_You must have paid a lot of attention to the sound._

Sound is like smell. Take a clock ticking. It can either be very soothing, if it’s a loud tick, or there can be something incredibly melancholy about it. I know what those kind of stifling interiors are like – I remember going into houses that were still Victorian, so circumscribed, we can’t imagine now what it was like. The fact that someone in authority, even when I was growing up, would say [snaps fingers], ‘Don’t do that!’ – and you stopped. It materially alters what you look at and how you feel. But I do love that enclosed world.

_You don’t use late-romantic music._

I was writing the screenplay, and I go to a gym, and someone put on the slow movement of the Marcello concerto, and I thought, that’s it – classical, because baroque is very formal but with a wonderful kind of life within that formality. And that’s true of the film. When I was writing the opera scenes and the transition from New York to Monte Carlo I knew it had to be _Così fan tutte_ because the overture’s so bubbly and then the trio is so divine you could photograph the Yellow Pages and put that over it and it would be fabulous. Late-romantic music is too big, too symphonic, and I didn’t want a score plastered all over the place – you’re supposed to feel sad now, you’re supposed to feel happy here. I can’t be doing with that. Music should be counterpoint, just enough so that you may not even be sure what you feel, but you feel something.

_You don’t have any voiceover._

No, that was deliberate. There are three great voiceovers. First is _Kind_ _Hearts and Coronets._ Then it’s Joanne Woodward in _The Age of Innocence._ Then there’s William Holden in _Sunset Blvd._ If you can’t have a voice over in that class, don’t do it. I thought, the tone has to be found, and the drama has to carry it.

_How important for you are British directors and British films? You mention_ Kind Hearts and Coronets _, and David Lean comes to mind, partly as an adapter of classics._

Lean’s _Great Expectations_ is wonderful, and despite the fact that there are many unintended comic moments in _Brief Encounter_ because of the way they talk, it’s still incredibly moving. _Kind_ _Hearts and Coronets_ I think is the greatest comedy of manners made anywhere. The fact that they might remake it with Robin Williams and Will Smith makes me want to blow my brains out.

_I understand the film has had a difficult ride. What are your feelings about it now?_

There were times when I thought it would never happen. But at least now it has been made and I’m very proud of it and of all the people who worked on it. God knows what the next thing is. I wish I had more savvy, but I don’t seem to possess it.
