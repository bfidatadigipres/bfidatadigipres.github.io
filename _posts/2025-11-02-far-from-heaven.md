**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Todd Haynes has managed, surprisingly successfully, to build different levels of audience access into _Far from Heaven_, almost like the branching paths of possibility built into a videogame. The _Far from Heaven_ screen world seen by a fan of 1950s Hollywood melodrama will not be the same as that seen by someone who can’t ‘get’ the film’s range of reference and layers of quotation. On the face of it, there could be a hierarchy here whereby the knowing spectator achieves a superior relation to the film. But _Far from Heaven_ has a visual richness and social significance that works in its own right. Haynes locates the film – which focuses on wealthy suburbanite Cathy’s unhappy domestic life – at a precise moment in American history: 1957 was a time when well-to-do suburbs were no longer a novelty, when McCarthyism was in retreat and commodity culture had become integrated into a middle-class way of life. Haynes’ view of this suburban America is inspired by hindsight, and especially by post-1960s awareness of racial and sexual politics. A weight of repression and fear hangs over both Cathy and her black gardener Raymond’s tentative relationship and husband Frank’s cruising, but the film hints that desires deviating from the norm were already pushing at the doors of sexual respectability and racial segregation. At first _Far from Heaven_ might seem to suggest that these two social oppressions are equal and parallel in intensity, but as the plot unfolds social anxiety at homosexuality is shown to be infinitely less deep rooted than the hysteria caused by intimacy across the racial divide. Cathy and Raymond’s friendship touches an absolute taboo in Hartford, Connecticut. While gayness may be persecuted by law, Haynes suggests that Frank might well find not only happiness with his lover but also a new form of friendship with Cathy and the children.

Frank’s story hints at a ‘happy end’; Cathy’s story ends in tears. Even audiences unaware of film history cannot but recognise a degree of self-consciousness in _Far from Heaven_. The carefully constructed _mise en scène_ is a reminder that collective memory of the 1950s is, by and large, a product of media imagery – of advertising, of lush, widescreen, highly coloured Hollywood movies, of early television and the sanitised, family fare promoted then. Haynes takes this 50s American ‘heritage’ as the concoction it is, and inserts a political subtext into media imagery as memory. It would, in fact, be difficult for any spectator, however movie illiterate, not to pick up some of the clues suggesting that Hollywood cinema itself is an essential part of _Far from Heaven_’s frame of reference. Once its world mutates from a ‘historical’ 1950s into the movie world of 1950s Hollywood melodrama, the film’s political significance takes on a different edge.

For the fan of Hollywood melodrama, however, the cinematic frame of reference is unavoidable from the beginning. _Far from Heaven_’s opening moments play as a direct quotation. The credit sequence maps out leafy, autumnal, Douglas Sirk territory and his _All That Heaven Allows_ (1955) is immediately recognisable when a high-angle shot shows a station wagon pulling up outside a typical suburban house. The scene is then set for Jane Wyman’s Cary Scott, conventional resident of this milieu, to fall in love, unconventionally, with her gardener, Rock Hudson’s Ron. But this quotation is undermined by another, and the cinematic reference shifts abruptly. While the production values of Sirk’s Universal A picture stay on screen, the opening lines of dialogue conjure up a black-and-white Columbia picture of 1949: Max Ophuls’ _The Reckless Moment_. Julianne Moore’s Cathy calls out ‘Sybil’ as a black maid walks down the garden path, then ‘David’ to her son playing on his bike. (‘Put your shirt on, David’; ‘Help Sybil with the groceries, David’.) Moore thus occupies a similar role to Joan Bennett’s Mrs Harper in Ophuls’ melodrama of small-town family life. Although the maid from _Far from Heaven_ echoes the original Sybil’s understanding and dignity, Haynes has other interests at stake in his citation of _The Reckless Moment_.

On this level _Far from Heaven_ operates within the critical history that surrounds Hollywood 50s melodrama: as inability to express emotion torments its characters, so camera, colour, music and so on suggest what cannot be said in words. In _Far from Heaven_ Haynes tries to find a voice for melodrama’s silences while also paying tribute to its cinematic style. He looks back at the stories in the spirit of ‘what if...’ Does the social shock caused by cross-class romance in _All That Heaven Allows_ hide another, taboo, story of cross-race romance?

This experiment (which occasionally acknowledges Fassbinder’s brilliant 1973 reworking of the Sirk story _Fear Eats the Soul_) has no possible social foundation. For instance, when Ron takes Cary into the country, the beautiful old mill stands by the stream offering an alternative and idyllic lifestyle. In the equivalent scene, Raymond takes Cathy into the woods, but there is no suggestion of a marginal culture or Thoreauesque ideal in which they can find refuge.

On the other hand, Haynes turns the premise of _The Reckless Moment_ on its head: it is not the father’s absence that allows a louche underworld to threaten the respectable, middle-class home but rather his presence. The atmosphere of seedy downtown bars (brilliantly lit by Edward Lachman with green and purple highlights) is not displaced on to the blackmailer as in _The Reckless Moment_ but represents the repressed within the home itself. The two stories come together at the end. Cathy lies on her bed, crying for her lost love, and at the cruelty of their world, just as Lucia Harper in the same _mise en scène_ weeps for the petty criminal who had fallen in love with her. In both movies the telephone rings and Sybil calls out ‘Mr Harper/Mr Whitaker on the telephone, Mrs Harper/Mrs Whitaker!’ Here the films diverge. In _Far from Heaven_, a cutaway shot shows Frank talking on the telephone in his hotel room, with his lover in the background. Of course, there’s no such cutaway in _The Reckless Moment_. But the fan of the Hollywood melodrama cannot but pick up the implications behind Haynes’ suggestion. Tom Harper’s absence from the family might well be due to other reasons apart from engineering work in Berlin. While _Far from Heaven_ can be appreciated on any level, these cross-narrative implications, poignant and witty, suggest that now that cinema is history, the filmmaker can also be the film historian.
