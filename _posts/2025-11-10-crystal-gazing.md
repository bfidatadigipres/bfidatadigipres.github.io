**Laura Mulvey on ‘Crystal Gazing’**  
In _Crystal Gazing_, the question of narrative situation revolves around the four characters we took from Erich Kästner’s _Fabian_ and reinvented for our script. The atmosphere of disillusion and disorientation that has overwhelmed the book’s intellectual, bohemian protagonists in Berlin in 1930 seemed relevant to the onset of Thatcherism. But through images of the future and the idea of crystal gazing, we added another dimension. Real or fantastic, these ‘intimations’ reach towards an indistinct temporality in which ‘now’, ‘then’ and ‘to come’ are entangled. For instance, during the magic act in the fifth scene, the protagonist is described in the voice-over as ‘looking through a childhood window onto a landscape where the present succumbed to the future’. And later: ‘They had damaged the map to dreamland and there was no way home for the blindfolded’. The four characters loosely represent different and contrasting aspects to this sense of time, varying between ruined traces of a lost utopianism to the technological advances of speculative capitalism.

Peter and I had begun, in the late 1970s, to collect newspaper articles about contemporary capitalism, gradually focusing our interest on the economics of future markets, which became the topic of the unmade project _Possible Worlds_ (1978). The latter not only prefigures the multiple-narrative and character structure of _Crystal Gazing_ but also revolves around ideas of the future, combining (through three emblematic characters) computer technology, market speculation on ‘futures’ and a utopian community. We salvaged something of this in _Crystal Gazing_; Vermilion works as a reader of satellite maps forecasting weather and crop trends. As the voice-over suggests, ‘This insight into the future, bought at such a great price, would benefit only a few... through the paradoxes of the commodity market, the prediction of failure could bring good fortune and money in the bank.’ (On the other hand, we lifted Vermilion’s very ‘modern’ marriage contract directly from the Berlin/Weimar atmosphere of Kästner’s novel.)

In both the novel and our film, the central character is a dreamer, who drifts aimlessly and is sacked from his job early on in the story. Neil, in _Crystal Gazing_, illustrates comic books and has invented a science fiction world of the future: ‘The Cities of Alpha’. In the novel and the film, his best friend is finishing a PhD but in _Crystal Gazing_ Julian’s semiotic and psychoanalytic reading of Charles Perrault’s fairy tale, ‘Puss in Boots’, revolves around the way that Puss’s speech acts and actions can alter his master’s future life. For Julian, ‘Puss in Boots’ was the founding text of modernism, the secular celebration of language as desire and language as power ... its transformation of lies into truth, fiction into fact and desire into fulfilment.

Throughout the central section of the film, Peter’s writing is once again of particular importance, both in its own right and also as a reworking of his longstanding interest in the relation between word, sign and meaning. The fourth character in _Fabian_ is a rising movie star who sells out to a corrupt film industry; in _Crystal Gazing_, Kim is a rising pop star. Lora Logic’s music, her saxophone and most particularly her voice light up the film, bringing the culture of punk that Peter and I had wanted, but also an unexpectedly lyrical and melancholy resonance that enhances the story and its atmosphere. The gender politics of _Crystal Gazing_ reflect the changing economic atmosphere of the 1980s as a male-centred labour force began to succumb to unemployment and casualisation while women’s marginal work remained, by and large, the same.

Woven into these temporal twists are the points where ‘necessity and contingency collide’, the blockages that thwart Neil’s progress: from wrong turnings, to the unexpected husband, to the crossed telephone line, to his accidental death. To enhance this sense of a narrative at standstill, we also inserted into _Crystal Gazing_ quite arbitrary scenes, episodes and images. Some of the locations taken from our Ladbroke Grove neighbourhood have no significance for the story: the Portobello fish-and-chip shop, the Golborne Road Chinese takeaway, Elgin Books, Rough Trade, the restaurant Monsieur Thompson, the mural by Ladbroke Grove Underground Station. There were also quotations and images, such as the crystal ball, the Rings of Saturn and the Joseph Cornell box.

All these turnings, references, stories within stories and interruptions created a continuum with the principles of ‘counter-cinema’: narrative intransitivity, multiple diegeses, apertures formed by citation. The story of the rationale for Neil’s projected trip to Mexico was drawn from an experience of Peter’s when he was researching our Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti exhibition. In Mexico City, he visited Dolores Olmedo, the powerful patron of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo and an important collector of their work, to solicit her support and the loan of Kahlo paintings. To Peter’s horror, she explained that in order to buy ‘an expensive Diego Rivera’ at Sotheby’s, she had pawned two Kahlos at the Central Pawn Shop in Mexico City. The ticket was held by Sotheby’s, New York. Eventually the situation resolved itself, and just in time for the exhibition, but the incident had made a strong impression on us.

In some notes for _Crystal Gazing_, Peter wrote: ‘London. Midwinter. 1982. Unemployment hangs like a noose round the neck of the city. Shattered dreams. Redundancy figures.... This is a story set in the Thatcher recession. But it begins far far away.... In the Cities of Alpha.’ These notes reminded me of the way that a film about the Thatcher-designed economic crisis is punctuated by dream-like images and themes. Here _Crystal Gazing_ has some kind of overlap with _Riddles of the Sphinx_, continuing and exaggerating the earlier film’s fusion of abstract spaces and actual locations. Ultimately this combination of the fantastic, in a range of different forms, with the starkness of everyday reality is characteristic of both films and comes close to capturing something of what Peter and I loved about cinema.
