Old Hollywood ‘women’s pictures’ have been a part of queer culture for decades, with stars like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford still reigning as gay icons. Fassbinder, Almodóvar and Haynes have all queered the Sirk-style weepie, while latter-day ‘camp classics’ such as _Mommie Dearest_ and _Showgirls_ have become firm favourites in the LGBTQ+ community. This event includes a rare screening of Douglas Sirk’s _Bourbon Street Blues_ (West Germany 1979, 25min).

**Bourbon Street Blues**  
No outline of Sirk’s German work would be complete without mention of the three films which he directed at the Munich film school in the 1970s: _Sprick mit mir wie der Regen_ (1975), _Sylvesternacht_ (1977) and _Bourbon Street Blues_ (1979). The first and third are based on one-act plays by Tennessee Williams (_Talk to Me Like the Rain_ _and Let Me Listen_ and _The Lady of Larkspur Lotion_ respectively). Williams’ _The Seven Descents of Myrtle_ was the last play Sirk directed (at the Thalia Theatre, Hamburg, in 1969). _Sylvesternacht_ is based on a playlet by Arthur Schnitzler, one of the director’s favourite dramatists, whose _Liebelei_ and _Anatol’s Hochzeitsmorgen_ he had staged at the Bremen Schauspielhaus during the 1920s.

Although these three short films are almost unbearably intense distillations of Sirk’s favourite themes and obsessions, they remain virtually unknown in Britain. The most elaborate of the trio is _Bourbon Street Blues_, in which the owner of a dilapidated New Orleans boarding house, Mrs Miller-Raczinski, who foolishly imagines herself to be descended from the Habsburgs, is drinking and dreaming herself into oblivion with her neighbour, a down-at-heel writer (Fassbinder) who thinks he is Anton Chekhov. Here the links with Sirk’s other works are at their most explicit: through the window we glimpse the flashing neon sign of the Habanera Inn, the New Orleans setting recalls _The Tarnished Angels_, and of course Sirk himself had adapted Chekhov’s _The Shooting Party_ as _Summer Storm_. Most fascinating of all, however, is the casting of Fassbinder; here Sirk’s fabled irony reaches its greatest heights. As Eithne Bourget aptly put it in one of the very few pieces written about any of these films in any language (_Positif_, April 1980): ‘He symbolises Sirk, every cineaste, every author, indeed every artist. In the ironic juxtaposition of the character – who does not have enough talent – and the actor – who has too much? – there is a critique of the artist, of the cineaste [Sirk] himself who is, in the last analysis, only a creator of illusions. Impotent in the face of the corruption of humanity and the decline of society, all that is left to him is irony, by means of which he can transmute sentimentality into melancholy.’ A fitting figure, indeed, for Douglas Sirk’s last film.

**Fyzal Boulifa** is a British writer-director of Moroccan origin, based between London and the North of Morocco. His films, combining melodrama and social-realist influences, are remarked for their singular use of non-professional actors. His films have been BAFTA-nominated, awarded at the Cannes Film Festival and screened widely in international film festivals. His most recent film as director is queer melodrama set in working class Morocco _The Damned Don’t Cry_. He has more recently begun working as a screenwriter, collaborating with other directors, most notably co-writing the script of Mahdi Fleifel’s _To a Land Unknown_, premiering at Cannes Director’s Fortnight 2024.

**Alex Davidson** is a cinema curator at the Barbican, a former programmer for JW3 and a former curator for the BFI National Archive. He has written for a variety of film publications, both at the BFI and beyond, and given cinema talks and presentations across the UK. His specialism is queer cinema and television.

**Ming Wong** is a Singapore-born, Berlin-based artist whose work contends with cinema and popular culture to consider how identity is constructed, reproduced and circulated. Through imperfect translations and reenactments in which the artist often plays all of the characters, Wong’s videos, photographs, installations, and performances uncover the slippages that haunt ideas of ‘authenticity’ and ‘originality’. His work ‘Life of Imitation’ is currently on display at Tate Modern. He is the 2025 artist-in residence at the National Gallery London.

**Sarah Cleary** is a freelance film curator based in London. She has appeared on panels and presented screenings at BFI Southbank, the Rio, the Garden and Picturehouse. She has also contributed writing to outlets such as _Sight and Sound_ and _Little White Lies_. Since 2023, she has been screening films at the Prince Charles Cinema in London as the curator of the Funeral Parade Presents, an ongoing monthly LGBTQIA+ film strand. Under the Funeral Parade moniker, Sarah has curated and hosted screenings ranging from exploitation oddities to arthouse classics.
