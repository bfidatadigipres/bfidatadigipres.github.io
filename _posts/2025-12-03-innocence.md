**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

For her debut feature Lucile Hadzihalilovic has produced a film of distinctive aesthetic quality and mystery. _Innocence_ charts a year or so in the life of a ‘timeless’ boarding school for girls situated in the middle of a forest. Young girls arrive at this strange establishment closed up in coffins, and depart by underground trains that rumble darkly, unseen, throughout the film. Clad in short white uniforms, the girls have their age signalled by coloured ribbons (they range from six to 12 years old). They are taught by two wan, beautiful schoolmistresses: Marion Cotillard as Mlle Eva, the ballet teacher, and Hélène de Fougerolles’ Mlle Edith, the natural science teacher. The girls are forbidden to leave or even enquire about the outside world.

Loosely based on a short story entitled _Mine-Haha, The Corporal Education of Young Girls_ by the 19th-century German author Frank Wedekind (better known for his play _Lulu_), _Innocence_ treads relatively unfamiliar territory in French cinema – that of the _fantastique_. Indeed, Hadzihalilovic’s references are international: she quotes Dario Argento’s _Suspiria_, Peter Weir’s _Picnic at Hanging Rock_ and Victor Erice’s _The Spirit of the Beehive_ as influences.

One of the film’s great achievements is its ability to mix everyday realism with the uncanny. For instance, the arrival in a coffin of the young Iris is followed by scenes showing the girls’ ordinary activities – playing, tying ribbons in their hair, swimming in the river. Strange details include night-time walks in a forest lit by street lamps and the way that the girls enter the school’s theatre through the small door of a grandfather clock. Yet the girls’ speech and concerns are ‘normal’.

When one girl, Laura, tries to escape in a boat and drowns, her coffin is burnt on a pyre in an extraordinary twilight ceremony after which life resumes as normal. Iris, our lead into the world of the school, asks questions about the odd goings-on. Why does Bianca disappear at night? What lies outside the walls of the school? But she receives no answers. We ask ourselves whether the school itself is the nether world (as the coffins would suggest), or whether the older girls will be ritually sacrificed or sold for sexual commerce as they leave the school. But the ending returns Bianca and her friends to a very ordinary ‘real world’, dispelling the viewer’s suspicions yet doing nothing to ‘explain’. As the director says, ‘the further the story progresses without giving any answers, the more the anxiety builds’.

_Innocence’_s narrative ambiguity is perfectly served by photography and sound. Cinemaphotographer Benoit Debie’s intense colour scheme makes the most of the mysterious forest and buildings, and the wide-screen format allows for striking compositions. Although the camera exploits sinister passages and dark corners, there are no nasty surprises. The razor-sharp use of sound, with music kept to a minimum, also contributes to the uncanny yet everyday atmosphere: the rumbling of trains, the tick-tock of ubiquitous clocks, the rustling of leaves and gushing of water are counterbalanced by dialogue delivered in deadpan by girls and adults alike.

What is this film saying about girlhood? If we are to believe the director, nothing explicit: ‘I haven’t tried to convey any particular message,’ Hadzihalilovic says. ‘Just as there are no answers to the questions, there’s no moral to the story either.’ Indeed, the film remains blank in respect of ideology or morality. The girls exhibit both cruelty and kindness, and while Mlle Eva says darkly that ‘obedience is the only path that leads to happiness’, she and Mlle Edith are supportive and tender towards the girls. The school’s emphasis on physicality is both liberating – hence the butterfly metaphor that runs through the film – and oppressively competitive, as pinpointed in the scene in which the headmistress visits the school to select the one lucky pupil who will escape.

_Innocence_ has been criticised for its dubious display of girls in an abundance of pigtails, short skirts and white knickers. Yet the film is made by a young woman with obvious sympathy for the girls portrayed (who deliver performances that are wonderfully natural).

As well as _Suspiria_ and _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, _Innocence_ also evokes Jacqueline Audry’s 1950 _Olivia_ – also set in a boarding school for girls, run by two female teachers and situated in the middle of a forest. In 1950, Audry was inflecting the then dominant costume drama genre to inject feminine, not to say feminist, ideas about girls’ sexuality. Hadzihalilovic uses the _fantastique_ for a more ambiguous and, in some respects, retrograde take on femininity: while in _Olivia_ the girls were taught literature, mathematics and languages, in _Innocence_ the emphasis is on ballet and the reproductive cycle.

In the end, though, the film’s ambiguity – however effective in terms of building suspense – will be its downfall for many spectators. What would be acceptable mystery in a short film begins to resemble self-indulgent whimsy in a feature of two hours’ duration. Nevertheless, Hadzihalilovic is testimony to the vitality and diversity of female filmmaking in France, where more than of a third of movies are made by women (something of a world record). _Innocence_ has – deservedly – garnered many prizes at several film festivals, and it makes one look forward to the director’s next film.
