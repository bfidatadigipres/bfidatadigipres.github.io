**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Watching James Cameron’s films, I sometimes experience what I imagine the Lumières’ original audiences must have felt: a mixture of disbelief and delight, and a sense of wonderment at the magic of the movies. _True Lies_ has several such moments, my favourite being the scene in which Arnie, on horseback, gallops after evil Aziz (Art Malik), who is on a motorcycle. The chase takes us through busy streets, a hotel lobby, up an elevator and across tall buildings. It is silly stuff – but silly stuff is rarely so thrilling.

Spectacle films don’t rely on the same types of realism as genres such as domestic comedies, but verisimilitude nonetheless remains an important criterion. We know that Arnold Schwarzenegger isn’t actually flying the jet in _True Lies_, yet if we could see how the effect was constructed (by detecting the matting, morphing or miniatures, for example), our pleasure would be lost. Part of the joy of Cameron’s films (and this applies even to _Piranha II: The Spawning_) is that they trick us so well.

Critical response to _True Lies_ has so far been mixed. My local newspaper in Montreal awarded the film only two stars, recommending that audiences wait until it is released on video – as ridiculous a piece of advice as one is likely to get. The film offers many pleasures (humour, romance), but perhaps the greatest, the one unavailable on video, is what the bulk of its reputed $120 million budget was spent on – the creation of particular kinds of spectacle (luxurious sets, exotic locations, huge boys’ toys, high-speed chases, dramatic shoot-outs and extravagant explosions) whose enjoyment is predicated on widescreen viewing and increased by audience participation. Unlike _La Totale!_ (the 1991 French film directed by Claude Zidi on which Cameron’s work is based), whose effects are not diminished on a small screen, _True Lies_ is a film to see at the movies.

A comparison of _La Totale!_ and _True Lies_ can probably tell us much about the specificity of French and American national cultures. But such a comparison also points up some of the characteristics of the contemporary big-budget American spectacle film, Cameron and Schwarzenegger’s speciality both in their previous collaborations (_The Terminator_ and _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_) and in the rest of their individual oeuvres. Watching _La Totale!_ reminds us that _True Lies_ is a type of cinema rarely feasible outside Hollywood. Smaller national cinemas cannot afford and do not have similar access to cutting-edge special effects technology (much less the opportunity to develop it with particular films in mind, as Cameron did for _The Abyss_ and _Terminator 2_). Only Hollywood can maintain an infrastructure which keeps employed personnel skilled in a wide range of narrowly specialised areas of filmmaking.

In both _True Lies_ and _La Totale!_, a couple, happily married for many years, find their marriage in trouble. The wife (Helen Tasker, played by Jamie Lee Curtis in Cameron’s film) is approaching middle age and longs for excitement at least once in her life. She does not know that her husband Harry (Schwarzenegger) has lied to her throughout their marriage and is in fact a highly glamorous secret agent rather than the boring nine-to-fiver she believes him to be. Her would-be paramour Simon (Bill Paxton) is also lying to her: while trying to seduce her by posing as an agent and taking credit for her husband’s exploits, he is in fact a used-car salesman. By the end of the film, the husband has neutralised the competition and recruited the wife into his organisation. Working together, they keep their marriage spicy and their country safe.

_True Lies_ and _La Totale!_ not only share this almost identical plot (and a subplot about Arab terrorists stealing weapons and wanting to blow things up), but the former also borrows situations, props and even lines of dialogue from the latter. Yet the two films belong to different genres (or perhaps more accurately deploy different combinations of elements from various genres), and indeed to different modes altogether. _La Totale!_ mixes elements from the picaresque sex comedy, the domestic melodrama, the buddy-cop film and the spy film. But as one would expect from the director of _Les Ripoux_, the film’s primary aim is to make the audience laugh. _True Lies_ mixes elements from the screwball comedy, the domestic melodrama (both films are family romances), the buddy-cop film (the Tom Arnold-Arnold Schwarzenegger relationship can be read as a twist on that of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the _Lethal Weapon_ films), and the spy film (though the spectacular elements and hero’s panache are drawn more specifically from the big-budget Bond movies). But as one would expect from the director of _Aliens_, the film’s primary aim is to provide spectacle that will thrill, chill and awe the audience.

The comic elements in _True Lies_ are successfully realised, but though they are sometimes combined with spectacle, they most often alternate with it, just as the film switches between the domestic and public spheres, and push the narrative forward. The first scene in the film is an action scene; the last a comic one. Both feature a tango. At the beginning Schwarzenegger dances with the sexy Asian villainess (Tia Carrere); by the end he’s dancing with his all-American wife. Their marriage is saved, the United States is free of Arab terrorists, the former suitor is made to pee in his pants at the feel of a lipstick and the hero and heroine tango into the night. _True Lies_ may just be an embroidered _La Totale!_, but the embroidery is so extensive and skilful as to constitute a  different object.
