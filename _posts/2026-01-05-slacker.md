**Richard Linklater on breaking through and ‘Slacker’**

_In your early learning about cinema, was your focus on watching films or amassing technical expertise?_

All of the above. I just read a Godard quote recently about his early twenties, watching a thousand films a year. He said, ‘The cinema screen was the wall we had to scale to escape from our lives.’ _Exactly_. The people who do this are the ones who are manifesting an alternative universe for themselves. That’s what I was doing. I started a film society; I just created a bubble. There was no money involved. It runs on pure interest and passion – to this day. That’s what the arts are – an alternative universe where this little thing you’re doing is important. Isn’t that all that matters?

Every young filmmaker is insecure. ‘Is this going to happen for me?’ Well, it’s going take the world a lot longer than you think to discover just how great you are. It won’t be at the rate you want. It’ll be when you actually maybe _are_ great, after a lot more work than you can possibly imagine.

_There’s a pragmatism and resilience there that might be at odds with some artistic sensibilities!_

Yeah, I think you can be too sensitive. I’m plenty sensitive, but I put that in the right place. You’ve got to have this other element. I realised early on, it requires a multiple personality – you can’t just have one skill-set. You have to be a bit of a hustler, a charmer, a bit of a manipulator. The best book I ever read about that was Elia Kazan’s _A Life_ [1976]. He talks about qualities he had that made him feel kind of phoney: he was something to everybody. But what is film but adapting – making it work with this person, convincing that person to trust you?

_Do you remember first realising that a film was directed by a person – that that was a job?_

Not really. I didn’t fully understand it for a while. When I was a kid, the one famous director was Alfred Hitchcock, and I didn’t know what he did. I knew it had something to do with these scary, thrilling kind of movies we’d watch on TV… but I didn’t know. I always thought I was going to be a writer. By high school, I was writing plays and short stories, and I thought, ‘I wonder if I could write a movie?’ I think seeing _Annie Hall_ [1977], I was like, ‘Oh – Woody Allen _wrote_ that. And he’s in it, and he directed it.’ It started to all make sense a little bit. I saw _Eraserhead_ [1977], that was another one, my senior year of high school. So it started occurring to me. And then my dad explained the auteur theory to me. He wasn’t a cinephile, but he had vast knowledge, he was aware of stuff. So he had some notion of the American studio system versus the European auteur. And I thought: ‘That sounds pretty interesting.’ So I started watching everything. Subtitled movies, for the first time. Going to movies alone. You know, these little leaps you take. The day it becomes not a social mission, but what you do. Go in the afternoon, buy tickets, sit alone. It felt weird the first time, and then then you realise: this is wonderful.

_And setting up the film society – what inspired that?_

This was the mid-80s, so film societies were all kind of dying, because of video. But I just wanted to see the movies. It was completely self-serving. I realised I could rent them for a hundred and something dollars, and I could get 50 people to pay two or three dollars…

_Did you do the projection yourself?_

Me, some roommates, whoever wanted to help out. They were 60mm prints.

_Have you never wanted to make a film about a film society?_

The film freak film! Well, I’m making that right now [with _Nouvelle Vague_]. They were good years. Living in your cinema, showing films, watching films. I learned a lot. You learn how to go find an audience. And I think it fit my personality. I was fundamentally shy; not that outgoing. But I could do it on behalf of a Fassbinder series. I could do it on behalf of cinema. I didn’t mind asking for favours. Cheating. Stealing.

_So you knew how to do all of that when it came to making your own films._

Well, parallel to that I was making my own – I was making shorts, I made a Super 8 feature [_It’s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books_, 1988]. Making sure I made a separate feature in there.

_Did you feel when you made_ Slacker _that you’d gone up a level?_

It was probably the biggest leap I ever took. It was still a no-budget film, but I’d made films privately up to then. With this one, I was asking people to give me their time – cast and crew. That’s very hard, with no money. You have to really manipulate and charm when you’re not able to pay people. Man, are you dancing. It was tough. Yeah. But it was also: ‘Can I do this? Can I lead a group, can I articulate my ideas?’ Especially as it was a film that was hard to describe.

_Did acting in it yourself help with that, or was that more of a necessity?_

It was a natural offshoot of the design of the movie, but I thought I’d be the first one in the pool. I had been in acting classes for all that time, too, and you do a lot of monologues. I liked the monologue, and I also saw actors of all kinds be able to do it – even not very professional actors could still hold court on one thing. It feels like improv, but of course, it’s not: it’s all really tightly structured. That film… no one really knew what it was except me. I was having a little private revolution. But we all believed.

_What did it feel like when it was not only accepted, but embraced?_

I’ve found myself in this same headspace since: ‘This is a film that may not work; maybe no one will understand it; it doesn’t have a story; it doesn’t have a recurring character.’ But I had such deep belief in the experience it would be watching it, I thought I could keep an audience. I come back to the power of cinema. I bet the whole thing there. And then when it… I say ‘worked’, it wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but people who knew cinema saw whatever was fresh about it. A lot of teachers showed it: here’s a film that breaks every rule, and yet somehow works.

And I had no faith because at that point, the indie world was truly a New York phenomenon. I thought, ‘I’ll make this film from Texas and because it doesn’t have cowboys in it, no one will take this film seriously at all.’ I guess on an anthropological, social level, I was amazed that we would be accepted in places like New York. I always had that little Southern chip on my shoulder: the left-behind, the lower class… I thought it just wouldn’t be accepted in the official film world. And I was just amazed at how open they were. That’s a real tribute to our business. So that was wild, to see it get picked up and become part of the cultural conversation – President Clinton quoting it in a speech, things like that. That’s completely lost these days, of course. I think the mainstream back then was still a little more avant-garde, indie-curious, and now they just can’t afford to be.
