_+ intro by Lisa Kerrigan, Senior Curator of Television, BFI National Archive_

**A contemporary review**  
There’s been a rush to proclaim the apocalypse in everything that has been written so far about _Twin Peaks_, as if one could expect nothing less bleak or damning about the human condition – or at least about what goes on in apparently quiet, respectable small towns – from the director of _Blue Velvet_. ‘There is terror in sunlight, warmth in the darkness, and unspeakable muck just the other side of the white picket fence,’ declared the American magazine _Connoisseur_ (September 1989), and according to _The Independent_ (November 24, 1989), the film lifts ‘the rock off another mythical American town seething with adultery, corruption and deviance.’ So eager are writers to see in Lynch the new prophet of doom, or the smiter of small-town, home-town and domestic values everywhere, so eager in fact to slot him into the horror-in-the-familiar and/or-the-family nexus that has become the critical cliché of the moment, that they are led into blatant mis-descriptions of the film’s generally placid style. Thus _The Independent_ talks of the initial corpse washed up on the shore of ‘a blood-red river at dawn’ (the scene’s tones are actually more soothingly grey), and _Time Out_ (Nov. 29-Dec. 6, 1989) sees ‘the spiritual unease and corruption of the community’ mirrored in ‘bizarrely angled compositions, slow motion ... ,’ a description that only applies, in a limited way, to one short scene.

_Twin Peaks_ is the pilot for an eight-part television series created by Lynch and _Hill Street Blues_ writer Mark Frost. Lynch and Frost were slated to direct another episode apiece and other directors (Tim Hunter, Caleb Deschanel) to handle the rest. There may be irony in the creator of _Eraserhead_ becoming a network TV director, or in the continuity between _Twin Peaks_ and _Peyton Place_ (ABC is the network behind both). But then it has been the brief of soap operas from _Peyton Place_ onwards to lift rocks off hotbeds of adultery, corruption and deviance, which would make it neither a radical nor a particularly interesting thing for _Twin Peaks_ to do. Hence the upping of the stakes by those commentators who claim that what Lynch and Frost have uncovered is even more deviated, or that they have done it by expressionistically flouting the rules of network TV. If this is misleading, it would make sense to see _Twin Peaks_ following the ‘deviance’ of _Hill Street Blues_ by including more than one plot per episode, and allowing some plots to meander through the whole series. Though the murder is the main preoccupation here, mini-plots are set up involving other characters (about 15, due to grow to 40, according to Frost, through the complete series).

Even so, far from outraging the precepts of network TV, and the procedures of soap operas, mini-series or multi-part dramas, what _Twin Peaks_ may have done is to produce something that is more ‘TV’ than TV has ever dared to be. It’s as if, through the show’s strange, dislocated but immensely seductive mood, Lynch and Frost had planned a kind of reciprocal invasion, the community they have created through the programme reaching out and absorbing the community of TV viewers, and vice versa. So much is implied by Lynch’s own declared aims: ‘I couldn’t care less about changing the conventions of mainstream television. We just wanted to make a story and to feel the mood of a town that seemed a good place to visit. There’s a surface in a small town and a million different mysterious levels hiding beneath it’ (_The Independent_, op. cit.). And to achieve this, the programme relies less on the agitations of plot to hook viewers’ attention, or the suspense of who is doing what to whom, than a different layering of moods: ‘We had these ideas, these feelings about a story with a background, a middle ground, and a foreground. The background was a crime. The middle ground was eight or ten characters in a small town. The foreground was an episode, kind of a moment or like a sequence of moments, not even a whole day maybe, with a beginning, a middle and an end’ (_Connoisseur_, op. cit.).

Relegating plot and characters to the middle or background, and bringing into the foreground something which sounds vaguely like ambience or atmosphere, the ‘community’ of time and space within which the story takes place, is more radical as a narrative strategy than _Hill Street Blues_, and altogether lacking the thematic interest of the small-town expose. If there’s a reciprocal invasion taking place here, then it’s no wonder the context feels more like science fiction than soap opera, or like a laboratory for forcing human behaviour into all sorts of weird and wonderful forms: the police photographer who weeps over his work; the station-house telephonist who lays out midnight ‘snacks’ of every imaginable kind of doughnut; the gas station owner’s eye-patched wife, who nags to have drapes hung so that she can swish them back and forth as if on some mad piratical mission. Even the melodramatic steps by which the initial murder is revealed – the distraught mother on the phone to her husband about their missing daughter, just as the sheriff arrives to give him the news, the languid pans down the dangling phone as her sobs become more hysterical – have the chill of some slightly foreign rites, like those of dynastic slaughter and succession on the planet Dune.

_Twin Peaks_, film and town, is a laboratory not unlike the cosmic one of _Dune_, or the single room of _Eraserhead_, or even those constructions, sheds for storing things he had collected, ‘textures’ he was interested in studying and reproducing, to which Lynch was reputedly devoting his time in between _Eraserhead_ and _Elephant Man_. Each film is its own little space-time continuum, and what it contains (‘a sequence of moments’, moments most perverse in their mingling of recognisable periods) might be answerable to little logic except that of the dream. If Henry Spencer was evidently the dreamer of _Eraserhead_, trying to imagine himself into being, it is less obvious but interesting to speculate that the dreamer of _Twin Peaks_ might be FBI agent Dale Cooper.

A tightly groomed, tightly smiling Kyle MacLachlan, he is the very epitome of the kind of obsessive cop who often turns out to be the villain. But he also turns out to be sweetly reasonable, perspicacious, humorous in his fashion (‘Do you know why I’m whittling this stick?,’ he confides to a fellow stakeout cop, ‘because that’s what you do in a town where a yellow light means slow down instead of speed up’), and quickly tuned into the secret circuits of this community. Along with every item of expenditure that is dictated into his pocket recorder, he waxes lyrical about the local flora and fauna (Douglas firs have a special tang for him), and enquires about all the local ‘characters’ assembled in the town hall to hear about the investigation (‘Who’s the lady with the log?,’ he asks of one woman indeed clutching a piece of tree as she frantically switches the lights on and off to call the meeting to order; ‘We call her the Log Lady’ comes the ineffable answer).

There is in _Twin Peaks_ an anarchy of observation, of invention, of digging within the fascination of stories and ‘secrets’, that may not be quite the same as a fascination with the stories themselves. One wonders if all the half glimpses into the lives of the inhabitants of Twin Peaks – so many specimens in the laboratory – really have much life in them as stories. Inevitably, Lynch’s melodrama has prompted comparison with Douglas Sirk, as a critical view of small-town life. But a truer comparison, in spirit if not in mood, might be with Preston Sturges, who took a more amoral delight in his characters’ conniving, in the riot and inventiveness of their ‘secret’ lives. Like Lynch’s, his life around and in-between his films also exhibited that odd, multi-faceted personality of the investigator, the tinkerer, the inventor. And there is in _Twin Peaks_ one irresistible moment of Sturges comedy, when the daughter of local smoothie Benjamin Horne sabotages her father’s promotion of the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates development by telling visiting businessmen about the recent murder. As the latter hurriedly depart their hotel, the incongruous cry goes up, ‘The Norwegians are leaving! The Norwegians are leaving!’
