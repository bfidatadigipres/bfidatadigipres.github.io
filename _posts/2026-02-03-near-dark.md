In 1988, the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City singled out independent horror film _Near Dark_, made by up-and-coming director Kathryn Bigelow, for special attention. Recognising the film’s originality and artistry, MOMA honoured the film by presenting it as part of their Cineprobe programme. Launched in 1968, Cineprobe was designed as a forum ‘for independent and avant-garde filmmakers to present their work.’ Films included in these seasons usually represented experimental and avant-garde cinema, ‘as well as narratives with new and unusual strategies.’ _Near Dark_ was screened on the 25 and 26 April 1988 – six months after the film’s theatrical release – accompanied by a mini-retrospective of Bigelow’s earlier films, notably her short, _The Set Up_ (1978), and her first feature, _The Loveless_ (1981), co-directed by Monty Montgomery. The inclusion of _Near Dark_ in MOMA’s programme – as well as its acquisition into the MOMA collection – signals its position as a genre film that pushes boundaries and challenges conventions, while equally possessing a distinct narrative and aesthetic style. MOMA’s retrospective also marked early recognition of Bigelow as a significant filmmaker and auteur.

_Near Dark_ is a vampire film set largely in the contemporary Midwest of the USA that rejects established genre conventions in favour of its own hybrid approach. It skilfully merges the Gothic with the conventions of the western, road movie and _film noir_ at a narrative and aesthetic level, while also introducing elements of the outlaw romance genre of _They Live by Night_ (Nicholas Ray, 1948) and _Bonnie and Clyde_ (Arthur Penn, 1967). _Near Dark_ tells the story of Caleb, a half-vampire trying to decide whether to embrace his new nature or return to his human family. It is the family of vampires who lure him into their nocturnal existence that is of central importance to the film’s innovation. They are defined by a nomadic lifestyle, anarchic behaviour, a passion for violence, an ambition for eternity, intense family bonds, and a gritty visual appearance. They are morally ambiguous and undermine the class structures that have historically defined stories of the undead. These are not aristocrats but instead they capture the allure and horror of the disenfranchised and the underclass.

The film is sumptuous in its aesthetic design, offering a nuanced and haunting presentation of its monstrous protagonists who stalk the backroads and desert landscape of the American Midwest. While it remains Bigelow’s only foray into horror to date, its innovation showcases the creativity and artistic richness of the genre without sacrificing its visceral qualities. The film’s reception by MOMA signals Bigelow’s standing as a director of significance at an early point in her career, not simply because of her visual art background, something that would be in keeping with many of the artists featured in the Cineprobe series, but because of the way in which she would from _Near Dark_ onward re-envision traditionally mainstream genres of filmmaking.

_Near Dark_ was co-written with Eric Red, who also collaborated with Bigelow on _Blue Steel_ (1990), as well as writing _The Hitcher_ (Robert Harmon, 1986) and writing/directing _Body Parts_ (1991) and _Bad Moon_ (1996). _Near Dark_ was their first collaboration and was part of an arrangement between Bigelow and Red designed to launch their careers as writer-directors. They agreed they would co-write two non-commissioned screenplays, which they would attempt to finance, with themselves attached as directors to help gain their foothold within the industry. They co-wrote _Near Dark_ and _Undertow_ with Bigelow attached to direct _Near Dark_ and Red to direct _Undertow_ (1996).

While the box-office results were poor, _Near Dark_ was generally well received by the critics, whose commentaries identified significant discourses that would surround Bigelow and the film as its cult standing developed. In particular, many critics saw its distinctive visual style and Bigelow’s generic hybridity as its primary strengths. Following _Near Dark_’s premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, _Variety_ praised the film for achieving ‘a new look in vampire films. High-powered but pared down, slick but spare, this is something akin to a _Badlands_ of the supernatural, a tale that introduces the unearthly into the banality of rural American existence.’ The association with Malick’s _Badlands_ (1973) is further developed by David Edelstein of _The Village Voice_ who, while recognising the film’s kinship with films such as _The Lost Boys_, saw greater allegiance to a broader cinematic tradition, remarking:

‘The terrain – and the messages about the sanctity of family – is not too distant from _Lost Boys_, but the approach is worlds apart. _Near Dark_ borrows its form not from horror movies, but from classic sagas of outlaws on the lam.’

Pam Cook similarly recognised the kinship with outlaw films when she praised the film for how it imbues the vampire genre with a ‘mythic dimension, as society’s outcasts wander the land wreaking unholy vengeance.’ John Powers of _L.A. Weekly_ saw the film as a combination of ‘Ray’s fated romanticism with Peckinpah’s poetic violence.’ The reviews repeatedly compare Bigelow to both classical and New Hollywood filmmakers such as Nicholas Ray, Sam Peckinpah, Terrence Malick and Arthur Penn – filmmakers known for working within genre while also transcending its perceived limitations.

Not all of the reviews were positive and the film received criticism for its graphic violence, described by Victoria Mather of the _Daily Telegraph_ as ‘a repellent directorial debut by Kathryn Bigelow’, concluding with the disclaimer ‘I _would like to think_ that we have got the worst film of 1988 out of the way in the first week.’ Caryn James of the _New York Times_ condemned the film for its seeming stylistic hybridity – a characteristic praised by many other critics – describing it as coming from the ‘scattershot school of filmmaking’ in which ‘the result of being pushed and pulled through the confusing styles of _Near Dark_ [...] is simple exhaustion.’ Many critics took issue with the film’s extreme violence – the roadhouse slaughter being mentioned repeatedly – but for some, such as Henry Sheehan, this was a testament to the film’s power:

‘This is a movie, that while not as dishearteningly bleak as Romero’s work or as stomach-churning as Cronenberg’s, projects a truly upsetting image of revulsion and horror, and its scenes of bloodletting [...] are not merely gross, but genuinely disturbing.’

Sue Heal criticised the film for its overkill in terms of violence, noting that she ‘staggered out [of the film] praying for a _Bambi_ revival’, but she also cautioned the reader not to dismiss Bigelow’s work, commenting that the film ‘may contain disturbing and often unnecessary pints of haemoglobin but _Near Dark_ has a beautiful, ethereal quality.’ Despite poor box office, the critics took note of this distinctive film and filmmaker, with Bigelow’s direction and genre innovation as the stand-out stars. By associating Bigelow with recognised directors from Hollywood and independent horror circles, these critics framed her as an auteur and _Near Dark_ as a revisionist horror film. These factors underpinned her inclusion in the Cineprobe season at MOMA and contributed to _Near Dark_’s cult status and Bigelow’s standing as a significant new American filmmaker.
