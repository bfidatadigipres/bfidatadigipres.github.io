_The screening on Thursday 5 February will include a Q&A with  Oscar-winning production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Wiesława Starska_

Between _Man of Iron_ and _Danton_, Wajda announced he was taking a rest from politics and staged a production of _Hamlet_ in Cracow. It’s tempting to detect a preliminary excursion to Elsinore in the company of the intense and self-pitying figure of Olbrychski in _The Maids of Wilko_, made as it was just after _Rough Treatment_ and before _The Conductor_. The _Wilko_ story is a surprise for being neither bitter nor despairing, just rather mellow and regretful; it offers Wajda’s most elegant meditation on what has been his most consistent theme. Ever since the Generation trilogy, he has dealt with the elusive glories of the past and the dubious heroics of sacrifice, ironically finding with _Man of Marble_ that after 20 years his concern had a contemporary ring to it once more.

The attraction of _Wilko_, however, is that its polemic is personal and its manner undemonstrative; Wajda’s symbolism is now of the simplest – candle flames, dinner tables, moving trains, a car with an open door – and his mood is one of convalescent amusement rather than anger. It’s as if he had taken time off to look up some old friends, ranging from Turgenev to Andrzej Lapicki (Wajda’s alter ego in _Everything for Sale_, here offering pre-credit medical advice), and found in their familiarity both comfort and reassurance. As with the performance of Maja Komorowska (the blonde sister), whose gestures all begin with the little finger of each hand, _Wilko_ puts poses first, predicaments second. It’s a film of costumes and theatricality, consciously charming – and charmed – with the fun of a recaptured, vaguely shapeless 1920s period, with its parasols, waltzes, and wind-up gramophones.

The slightly suspect nostalgia is of course perfectly in tune with the story, whose participants are all cherishing a 15-year-old memory and hoping, by dress and manner, to resurrect it. Viktor’s sudden arrival back in their midst is the miraculous answer to the sisters’ dreams; gathered round the table, they gaze at him incoherently with blame and gratitude for what his memory has done to their lives. The scene is beautifully handled, both by Klosinski’s tabletop camerawork and by Wajda’s team of actresses, each performance building in preparation for the confessions to come. And each later exorcism is a delicate, immaculate fusion of skills, from the tremulous removal of owlish spectacles in the forlorn hope of a kiss to the fluttering of a hand in agitation when a kiss arrives, from the curling of a body when a distant act of love is recalled to the curling of a lip when the disenchanting presence of the lover is dismissed.

As the ladies of Wilko grow and change, as their suitor’s weaknesses gradually emerge, one is reminded as much of Bergman as of Chekhov, as if _Cries and Whispers_ and _The Three Sisters_ were chronicles from the same family. Like Bergman, Wajda has let the faces do the talking (he even has Bergmanesque twins thumping out a duet on the piano), and the result is hypnotic theatre, from the captivating Christine Pascal (the youngest sister) retreating like her relatives into a blighted future, to the equally enchanting Zofia Jaroszewska (the aunt) who welcomes with rueful enthusiasm the brief rejuvenation of Wilko and reprimands her nervous maidservant for seeking a tiny share of the event.

Theatrical interlude or not, _The_ _Maids of Wilko_ offers the final satisfaction of being as substantial as one could wish from Wajda. Politics may have been set aside, but colours are flying just the same from the film’s mast. As he leaves Wilko for the second time in his life, Viktor’s eye is caught by an old man sharing his railway carriage. There is a close-up of the man’s face, his glance wandering momentarily straight into the camera lens, and as a tribute appears on the screen, and as the landscape through the train window becomes a tunnel of darkness, we realise this is the writer of the novel on which the film is based. The recognition is unimportant, probably meaningless to audiences outside Poland for whom Iwaszkiewicz is unknown, but the relationship between the faces of the fellow travellers is neatly and globally eloquent.

Here are the present and future Viktor, rushing together into the night, their partnership confirmed, their isolation analysed, understood and even – with a humorous melancholy – welcomed. Here too is any other sentimentalist who might persuade himself that the past can be preserved intact with all its promises, ready to be reactivated when convenient. Here is any expatriate convinced that the mere fact of his absence from a place will guarantee its perpetuity. And here too is any European who fought a war to defend a way of life only to find, regardless of his effort, that it became outmoded just the same. Wajda went on to make the same point in the very different context of _The Conductor_: the trouble with the past is that it never changes, while the trouble with the present is that it never stops.  
**Philip Strick, _Monthly Film Bulletin_, May 1983**

The film is unique in Wajda’s filmography in that it contains superb portraits of women. Here, women are the mainstay of order and graces exemplary members of society, responsible for themselves and for others. That is why everything that these women do – cook and fry, some red currants, raspberries with cream, they lay out flowers, sometimes play the piano, they read something to children in French – all of this is important. It is something that we desperately miss and need, while all this selflessness disappeared under the brutal stamp of contemporary life.

_The Maids of Wilko_ is generally considered one of the most beautiful and mature films produced by Wajda. In it, Wajda’s feeling for the beauty of the Polish landscape, his maturity in the treatment of life and death, and his feel for the passage of time contribute to the formation of a richly subdued portrayal of life, with all of its complexities. Music, colour, and _mise-en-scène_, all essential but non-excessive, create an atmosphere of peace and contemplation. Thanks to the film’s slow pace Wajda allows the women to play themselves and to improvise during the prolonged, serene scenes. In this film, the director does not present any thesis or didactically try to teach his audience what to do or how to behave. Rather, he lets the cameras roll and leisurely account for the events in front of and around them.
