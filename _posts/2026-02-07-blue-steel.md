**Kathryn Bigelow:** With _Blue Steel_ I wanted to do a ‘woman’s action film’, putting a woman at the centre of a movie predominantly occupied by men. When women go to see _Lethal Weapon_, many of them will identify with Mel Gibson. I was interested in creating a person at the centre of an action film who represents an Everyman that both women and men could identify with. At our initial screenings at the Berlin Film Festival, some men at the press conference commented that they found themselves for the first time in their lives identifying with a woman. I found this very interesting because finally the notion of self-preservation is universal. I wanted to create a very strong, capable person who just happens to be a woman, using the context of the police genre.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

**A contemporary review**  
After the cult success of the vampire Western _Near Dark_, Kathryn Bigelow is once more on dangerous ground. _Blue Steel_ is a foray into the nightmare world of a young woman cop who comes face to face with the distorted mirror image of her own desire for power and control when she falls in love with a murderer. As with _Near Dark_, the central character is an innocent who discovers within herself demons she never knew existed and which drive her to risk everything in a primeval battle for survival. Also like _Near Dark_, survival is as much a matter of coming to terms with internal dark forces as of vanquishing external evil.

The themes are hardly new: ‘deadly love’ precedents abound, from _film noir_ to _Spellbound_ to _Eyes of Laura Mars_ and _Jagged Edge_. _Blue Steel_ is a _noir_-influenced police movie which, like Michael Mann’s _Manhunter_ (to which it pays homage in the name of Megan’s partner Nick and in its pervasive blue light), hinges an obsessional scenario on the extravagant rituals of serial killing. Eugene Hunt’s paranoid fantasies and murderous ceremonies may lack the gruesome panache of the Red Dragon, but Bigelow adds a different dimension by making the pursuing law officer a woman (foreshadowing Jonathan Demme’s _The Silence of the Lambs_). By becoming a cop, Megan Turner makes herself, like Hunt, an outcast, a freak whose motives are always in question.

At her graduation, Megan’s best friend Tracy exclaims in admiration: ‘You’re on the right side of the law!’ Megan soon discovers that this is an uncomfortable, if not impossible place for a woman. Her father rejects her, potential suitors panic and take flight, her superior officers patronise and bully her, and the man she loves fetishises her. The film celebrates her perversity, making much of Jamie Lee Curtis’ androgyny and of Megan’s pleasure in dressing in uniform. But her entry into the predominantly male world of law enforcement is fraught with hazards, not just because of her inexperience (she makes a lot of mistakes) but because she is cast adrift in a deadly, hostile environment whose codes are unfamiliar to her, where nothing can be taken for granted except her vulnerability. It is not just her life, but her identity that Megan puts at risk.

This is evident in the way her lover/adversary Eugene invades every aspect of her being, even her dreams, claiming her as his other half and uncannily turning up to threaten her most intimate moments. A tense, edgy sequence in which Megan returns home with her father after arresting him for wife-beating, to find Eugene sitting on the sofa making small talk with her mother, is skilfully handled both in terms of suspense and in its implication that violence has its roots in the private arena of familial-sexual power relations. The scene echoes the film’s explosive opening, in which Megan, on a training exercise involving domestic violence, ‘shoots’ the husband, only to be ‘shot’ herself by the wife.

Megan’s Oedipal motivations drive her to challenge male authority and reject her destiny as a victim. The key to her survival is her gun, a double-edged weapon which endows her with power and authority, yet simultaneously transforms her into a fetish object. The mythical, erotic beauty of the gun is emphasised in the sensuous credit sequence, at the culmination of which the audience finds itself staring into the barrel of a Smith and Wesson. _Blue Steel_ explores a spectrum of emotions generated by gun worship, from Megan’s desire for justice to Eugene’s fantasies of omnipotence. Megan is horrified when confronted by Eugene’s adoration of her weapon, the power-crazed image of her he creates; yet it is only by acknowledging the supremacy of the gun, and by putting herself with Eugene outside the law, that she is able to defeat him, after a prolonged battle in which many innocent bystanders are put in danger.

The justification for Megan’s obsessively hunting down Eugene lies, as usual in the contemporary police film, in the impotence of the official law enforcement agencies. The rape scene (the last in of a series of monstrous assaults perpetrated by Eugene on Megan and those close to her), during which she kicks him off, causing him to fly several feet into the air, and wounds him before he escapes, cannot fail to engage sympathy for her subsequent actions, especially since Eugene, like all demons, stubbornly refuses to die. Yet her final victory is less a triumph than a loss. Megan sits in a catatonic state in a car, her gun on the seat beside her, as a cop lifts her, childlike, into his arms and the screen is suffused with a melancholy blue. In killing Eugene, it seems, she has also destroyed herself.
