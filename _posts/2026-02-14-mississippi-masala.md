Following the critical and box-office success of her 1988 debut feature, _Salaam Bombay!_ – at the time one of the highest-grossing exports in Indian film history – director Mira Nair chose for her next project a romance between an Indian American woman and an African American man. The subject emerged from her observations of the unifying and dividing forces among BIPOC communities in the United States. ‘Growing up in India, it’s so apparent, the consciousness we have of degrees of colour,’ Nair told _BOMB_ magazine in 1991. ‘So coming from that and witnessing it in an American context – I was intrigued.’

The background for the story began when Nair landed as an Indian student at Harvard. She found herself accessible to both white and Black communities; as she has put it, ‘a third-world sister to the Black community and kosher to the others – yet there were always these invisible lines. I felt that there was an interesting hierarchy where brown was between Black and white.’

Nair decided to set the film, initially titled _Twice Removed_, in the deep American South. She knew Indians who had settled and owned businesses there, and she was fascinated by their presence in a region with a long, troubled history of racial oppression and tension. The film’s two narrative strands – the interracial romance and the Ugandan Indians living in exile in the U.S. – would affect and reflect upon each other.

Nair’s longtime friend Sooni Taraporevala wrote the film’s screenplay. The director and screenwriter had collaborated on _Salaam Bombay!_, and the success of that project practically guaranteed that they would work together again. ‘We share a worldview,’ Nair has explained of her creative partnership with Taraporevala, who would go on to script such Nair films as _My Own Country_ (1998) and _The Namesake_.

Already a rising Hollywood star who had recently won an Academy Award for his work in 1989’s _Glory_, Denzel Washington was cast as Demetrius, the romantic lead whom Nair modelled after a real carpet cleaner she had met while conducting preproduction research in Mississippi. Washington’s participation was a major coup for Nair, who had been abandoned by her original financial backers after Ben Kingsley dropped out of the role of Ugandan Indian exile Jay. (Other potential financial backers suggested to Nair that she cast Caucasians in lead roles.) Lauded British Indian actor Roshan Seth took on the part of Jay, while fellow British Indian Sarita Choudhury made her acting debut as Mina, Jay’s daughter and Demetrius’s love interest.

‘I was looking for an Indian woman who could understand the Indian ethos ... as well as having a free-spirited side to her,’ Nair told the Australian television program _The Movie Show_. ‘Because she’s a “masala”, after all, and has to represent the hybrid quality of going to prayers in the morning and the disco at night.’ Seventy-five young Indian women auditioned for the role before Nair chose Choudhury: ‘From the moment I saw her, I knew this was Mina,’ the director has said. Many other roles – the film’s end credits list over 60 speaking parts – were filled by local actors and non-actors.

Nair’s directorial career had begun in documentary filmmaking, and so she planned _Mississippi Masala_ with an eye for the authentic. This necessitated unconventional production choices, such as shooting on location in Uganda, a country where no major film had been shot since _The African Queen_ (1951). Sets and costumes replicated the look of 1970s Uganda, and Nair even enlisted Kenyan actor Joseph Olita to play Ugandan dictator Idi Amin for a few brief moments.

Most of the film’s scenes that take place in the American South were shot in Greenwood, Mississippi. Wary of a production that might depict small-town southern culture in an unfavourable light, Greenwood residents questioned Nair as to whether she was making a film in the style of _Mississippi Burning_, the 1988 policier based on the mid-sixties murder of civil rights activists. Nair warded off scrutiny by offering reassurance that _Mississippi Masala_ was a ‘love story, trying to make it sound as insipid as possible.’

Released in the United States in early 1992, _Mississippi Masala_ received nearly universal acclaim from audiences and critics alike, bridging the gap between the art houses that turned Nair’s previous film into an indie success and the multiplexes that would soon turn Washington into a superstar. _Entertainment Weekly_, _The_ _Nation_, _People_, _Rolling Stone_, and Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert all hailed _Mississippi Masala_ as moving and insightful, and the film won the Golden Osella for Best Original Screenplay at the Venice International Film Festival as well as the Special Critics Award at the São Paulo International Film Festival.

‘It was the first Black and brown interracial love story, and I haven’t seen anything like that since,’ said Nair when reflecting on the film and its legacy in 2021, adding that ‘if we don’t tell our own stories, no one will.’
